&lt;p>When you look at this picture what do you see?  I see a man who is satisfied with his situation.  Sure there are the tribal markings, the blanket over the shoulder, the bleakness of the background and the stuff on the back of the man’s neck.  But what really jumps out, to me at least, is the satisfied look that his eyes and his mouth convey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two development pundit bloggers have discussed recently the cultural meme which the photos that are chosen to accompany NGO marketing campaigns, news articles on Africa, etc. convey. &lt;a href="http://www.how-matters.org/about/"> Jennifer Lentfer&lt;/a> who runs &lt;a href="http://www.how-matters.org/">how-matters.org&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://glennagordon.com/">Glenna Gordon&lt;/a> who runs &lt;a href="http://www.scarlettlion.com/">ScarlettLion.com&lt;/a>, among other sites, &lt;a href="http://www.how-matters.org/2010/10/24/pity-pictures-and-poverty/">both&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.scarlettlion.com/2010/10/just-how-stereotypical-are-images-of-africa.html">posted&lt;/a> on this issue yesterday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Am not sure exactly, but seems that the beginning of the conversation was Jennifer finding &lt;a href="http://waterwellness.ca/2010/04/28/perspectives-of-poverty/">this&lt;/a> posting from &lt;a href="http://waterwellness.ca/about/">Duncan McNicholl&lt;/a>.  The premise of Duncan’s posting is that the same subject arranged in two different modes conveys two very different emotional responses.  To take it a step further, the argument goes that the types of images which are chosen to be displayed in NGO marketing items, donor reports, media reports, etc. reflect both the world’s pre-conceived image of Africa &lt;em>as well as&lt;/em> furthering the intention of the person or organization which is using the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, this makes sense.  Generally most people would prefer to vindicate held opinions rather than challenge them.  But challenging opinions is the only way to change the cultural lens and changing the cultural lens is one of the post powerful enabling mechanisms for solidifying deep changes within societies.  Indeed, the NY Times ran a great &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24FOB-Footbinding-t.html?_r=2&amp;amp;partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;pagewanted=all">article&lt;/a> in their weekend magazine about this topic yesterday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing is this (he says as he puts on his lawyer hat) it takes a long time to change the perspectives of people.  It takes words, images, experience, and most of all repetition.  It takes emotional arguments, data-based arguments, and logical arguments.   And it is slow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Civil rights, suffrage, abolition, etc. did not come about just because someone in a position of authority said, “yeah this is how it is going to happen.”  They happened because first people worked hard to show the problems with the current cultural lens.  This happened through broad-based approaches (which obviously varied considering the different times and persons involved).  After the cultural lens was changed sufficiently, then legal and political mechanisms were triggered which could provide some accountability around the new cultural norm which was developing.  Those legal and political mechanisms have to be triggered *after *there is sufficiency in the base of people who will believe that what you are arguing for makes sense despite the history and the cultural norms of the moment.  Those legal and political mechanisms &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to be triggered (usually) in order to bring the “rest” into compliance with the cultural norm; in other words, to provide accountability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what in the world does that have to do with pictures in shiny brochures?  First, the analogy very much falls apart when probed in depth, so don’t do that.   I bring it up mainly to show that cultural change takes time and effort along many different tracks.  It seems to me that we’re at the beginning of this process with respect to the “world’s” opinion of “Africa.”  Even for development workers and bloggers I still see all too frequently a headline which says, essentially, “wow there’s some good news from Africa and here is what it is.”  It is of lesser import to me the surprise which is consonant in the headlines.  What is of greater import is that the headlines are running.  They are running more and more, at least across my twitter and rss feeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This base hopefully will in due course enable the triggering of some powerful accountability mechanisms.  Although the accountability mechanisms which can solidify the march towards progress which so many in the cheetah generation deserve and crave will not be as strong as a declaration as (say) an amendment to the US Constitution would be, they will be there.  And their presence will help to change the assumptions of the cultural laggards.  Perhaps more importantly, they will allow the next generation of elites within many countries of Africa to make the difficult decisions and to take the difficult steps which will reduce the income gaps and bring the middle class further along.  And after that, things will take care of themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is great stuff happening throughout Africa all the time.  People are creating beautiful images, beautiful paintings, and beautiful narratives.  It is fantastic to see, and I appreciate that people are pointing these out.  As more and more people hop onto the train the momentum will grow, not slow.  Some recent examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>African Digital Art’s Weekly Inspiration Postings: &lt;a href="http://www.africandigitalart.com/category/african-weekly-inspiration/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NYTimes Lens Blog on Dakar: &lt;a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/senegals-changing-urban-landscape/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Peter DiCampo’s Life without Lights series: &lt;a href="http://www.peterdicampo.com/#/life-without-lights/nightly-life/NIGHTLY_LIFE-1">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Sure things are still screwed up in many many ways.  But what is important to me about the meme which is developing is that the baseline assumptions about what the “current state of Africa” is moving.  This will create/has created a base of support among many.  At this point it seems to be coming mainly from development people and Africans themselves who are increasingly using the megaphone of the internet to get their message across.  But it has to begin somewhere.  From this base, a larger base will grow and the meme will extend to laggards within organizations and to laggard organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course it will be a long time before the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24sirleaf-t.html?ref=ellen_johnson_sirleaf">profile&lt;/a> of a ground-breaking woman will not begin with the backdrop of devastation, conflict, and decay.  It will be a long time until even those of us that live here in Africa change our assumptions to reflect the progress which is all around us.  And yet, it is happening.  Slowly but surely, like a nomad moving to a new grazing area, the collective cultural lens is shifting.  For me, for now, that is enough.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The water system in Hargeisa is over stretched, under maintained, now badly managed network, under funded cluster of an organization.  It makes money so the government doesn’t want to privatize it.  And that is likely the right move considering the power system is privatized and is a mess.  It is all the rage to claim that the private sector is going to save Africa, and I while I believe that I’m not a complete free marketer.  The private sector can be just as lazy and dumb as a public sector can be.  The presence of competition does not necessitate innovation and good economic behavior in and of itself.  But that is a different story and before I go down that road, let me tell you about my pipe problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pipes that supply Hargeisa were buried about an 1 deep all willy nilly throughout the place.  Whenever you go off of the main roads it is inevitable that you’ll have to drive over one.  That isn’t a structural economic problem.  That has little to do with Ministerial efficiency or World Bank proclamations.  It is just stupid and lazy workmanship.  It doesn’t have anything to do with a depressed education system or beleaguered healthcare system.  it is just stupid and lazy workmanship.  Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And because these pipes were not buried deep enough, and because I live near a bus station, the pipes that come to my house often are broken by buses running over them.  And then we have to pay for a plumber to come fix them.  The Water Agency this time even refused to drive a plumber up here even after we agreed to pay for the plumber.  And then after we brought the plumber up here to our sector of Hargeisa, the guy wanted $20, TWENTY DOLLARS, to do the fifteen minutes of work it would require to cut a new pipe, tap it, and tighten it onto the new pipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I told the guy to f-off.  He laughed, I rolled my eyes, he said ten, I agreed.  And then he fixed the pipe.  But since that time no water has come through the pipes.  I don’t think they’re broken as we can usually tell.  In the morning when we drive to work if the water has come and the pipe is broken it just pools uselessly in the muck at the main intersection of the bus station.  In a desert country with small water resources no one seems to give an F about this water just sitting there.  But that hasn’t happened in the past week or ten days since we paid the plumber to fix the water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is that the case?  Because I live near a hotel.  You know the kind, one of the few places in town known to cater to expats.  They are all in one shape or form the same.  But the guy who owns the hotel pays the guy who controls the water in our sector a little bit more each month and so the water guy reroutes almost all of the water to the hotel.  The old Hargeisa water manager was a friend of ours and when we told him our hypothesis in this regard he investigated, found it to be true, fought tooth and nail (I heard directly many of the conversations between him and the sector manager who is below him) for us, and still was only moderately successful in getting us water.  Since he was sacked for unknown reasons which had nothing to do with his competence but basically boiled down to the other dude supported the government than won the recent election and had to be rewarded somehow, since that time we have gotten water through the pipes on only a couple of occasions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So water and I have seemingly broken up.  And that is not cool with me.  It isn’t cool in a way that  has nothing to do with what any policymaker or bureaucrat or large NGO marketing department wants me to think.  It isn’t cool and it has nothing to do with funding levels (throwing more money at the sector isn’t going to get the pipes buried deeper, repaired faster, or micro-managed more equitably), bold statements, or glossy web sites.  It isn’t cool and much of it comes down to stupidity and laziness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Excuse me, I gotta run, the dude that drives the donkey cart with the ex-oil drum on the back is here to deliver my water.&lt;/p>

Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf &amp;amp; Hillary Clinton via @FP_Magazine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Madam President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf the current President of Liberia did a remarkable thing yesterday.  She &lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/05/25/liberias_ellen_johnson_sirleaf">told &lt;/a>the world that in ten years Liberia would be self-sufficient and able to stand on its own feet with only further investment &lt;em>and no aid&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In ten years, Liberia will have been out of its civil war for about fifteen or sixteen depending on how one classifies the end.  And if Liberia were to achieve it, they would have accomplished something remarkable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To provide some context Rwanda is now about sixteen years after their conflict.  They have had a President that in many ways can be analogized to Johnson-Sirleaf.  Kagame is pro-business, pro-US, and takes a rational approach to China.  And Rwanda is by all metrics doing very well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But they are not, yet, self-sufficient.  Liberia has distinct advantages that Rwanda does not.  More resources and sea-access are the main advantages.  So it may not be completely accurate to compare the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I especially appreciate her stance on China.  Many people in the development world wring their hands about China’s involvement in Africa.  This always comes across to me as protectionism of our fiefdoms.  There is &lt;em>no way that China can teach Africa anything, all they will do is steal their resources&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us not forget that Western companies have been stealing Africa’s resources for years.  I know plenty of Africans who are happy about the way that China interacts with their country.  They feel that the Chinese treat them more equally and less antagonistically than most donor agencies and iNGOs (especially governance iNGOs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ellen really seems to pinpoint the African meme towards China with this quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“China’s fast,” she explained. “They know what they want and they do it quickly.” Building schools, building roads, signing contracts, and offering loans — all of it can be done in weeks or months, not years as some donors and Western investors might take. In short, “China’s flexible.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And this speed is critical.  Opportunities for reform or development often open and close before Western donors can get an RFP published, much less funded, contracted, distributed, and the agency beginning to reform or development agenda.  China is much quicker, and while Westerners may question their motives, at least their motives are clear to everyone: them and their partners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, this clarity makes it easier for them to operate.  I doubt it is frequent that Chinese in Africa are accused of being spies.  Meanwhile, I have been accused of being a spy nearly every day for two years – something that has deeply affected the receptivity to my work and a story for another day.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This week the World Food Program (WFP) shoved out a &lt;a href="http://www.wfp.org/content/somalia-pirates-target-food-pushing-prices">press release&lt;/a> about how piracy was raising food prices in South-Central Somalia.  At first glance, most people who would read such a report will likely think, oh the poor people in Mogadishu.  Of course, I share their sentiments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is a deeper issue at work here.  One that I’m not sure many people realize.  The conclusion (because I’m a lawyer and we put these things up front) is that this rise in cost of business may have drastically good effects for the conflict in the South.  Here’s how I get there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those brains who study war break themselves into two-sides of the same coin (since they are academics largely they have to classify and camp-ify themselves in order to create non-existent academic conflict to drive conscriptions to their own camp to drive their own popularity to drive their tenure track – but that is a story for a different day).  I’m too lazy to look up what the classifications of the two sides are, but generally one camp focuses on the structural conditions for conflict to begin (guns, poverty, etc.) and another camp focuses on the social conditions for conflict to begin (ethnic diversity, natural resources, etc.).  Or something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These camps have outlined pretty logical paths for those who seek to mitigate, manage, or militate conflict to follow.  If conflict A is characterized as an X conflict than follow path Z to recovery.  Fair enough, and it has worked in several instances.  In Liberia (prototypical charasmatic leader led conflict), once Charles Taylor left then the conflict subsided almost instantaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difficulty for conflict academics and practitioners (and no I didn’t mistype that) when it comes to Somalia is that every category for conflict can be found.  Not only can every one be found, but the primacy of each driver of conflict into primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.  driver of the conflict will depend on the time and location in which one analyzes the conflict.  The drivers are like a kaleidoscope which is constantly fluctuating over time in each location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a post-modern hell for people who study these things – which answers my own question about the lack of detailed academic research on Somalia (that and the difficulty in getting correct information).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After living here for two years and studying and thinking through the conflict at length (because there is little else to do during a Somalia evening), and despite the kaleidoscopic nature of the conflict, a few themes can be extracted.  The first of which is that in the far south around the major rivers the conflict is really and truly about natural resources and land.  Which is why my organization has put in to do a project focused on conflict mitigation of natural resources driven low-level conflicts throughout Somalia – but particularly in that region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other major theme, and how this connects with the WFP report, is that the business community in Mogadishu is quite happy with the anarchical situation.  Let me explain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If Somalis were Americans a large percentage of them would be mid-nineties salesmen.  The ones that would drive the 2.0 Trans Am, sport their cell phones in belt holsters, and have lunch meetings at Hooters.  They are quite money focused (certainly more than many from West Africa), and this has some good consequences.  Here in the north the private sector is very vibrant and is driving much of the development; there remains a good environment for doing business – certainly better than the neighbors in the region.  However, the focus on money can make many a bit myopic as they are always chasing pennies and don’t see the dollars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have met businessmen from the south who laugh at their colleagues here in the north who &lt;em>only&lt;/em> make 67% profit (I’m referencing the telecom sector here) as opposed to in the south where they make double that. There are tons of instances in the history of the southern conflict where it has been oscillating towards some resolution but the business community ensures that instability returns quickly.  They are convinced that the anarchy allows them to live like kings and do whatever they want – in their minds make more money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet from my point of view they are looking at the wrong metric.  I think they should be looking at the total amount of profit.  Sure they can make a higher percentage in Mogadishu than the guys can here in H-town, but the pot is bigger here so in the end they make more money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where the dissonance approaches resonance frequency for me.  The  rhetoric has failed to show these men that peace will inevitably make them richer.  Although their profit margins will fall, their total  revenue will rise at a faster rate and they will end up with more money in their pockets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simple talking has failed to convince them of such a result, so here is where I’m optimistic about the WFP report.  If the pirates can (ironically) be the ones that raise the costs for the large importers then the effects of that rise in the cost of business will ripple throughout and maybe the arguments for resolution of the conflict will gain more weight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or maybe the businessmen will simply launch their own navies as they already have their own armies. I don’t know, but I remain optimistic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/worldchanging_fulltext/~3/raJq_tNDaA0/010976.html">The first&lt;/a> to be published was from &lt;a href="http://twit.com/alexsteffen">Alex Steffen&lt;/a>.  Money Quotes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Gates spoke about his commitment to using his massive philanthropic resources&lt;br>
(the Gates Foundation is the world's largest) to make life better for people&lt;br>
through public health and poverty alleviation (&amp;ldquo;vaccines and seeds&amp;rdquo; as he put&lt;br>
it). Then he said something he's never said before: that is it &lt;em>because&lt;/em>&lt;br>
he's committed to improving life for the world's vulnerable people that he now&lt;br>
believes that climate change is the most important challenge on the planet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even more importantly, he acknowledged the only sensible goal, when it comes&lt;br>
to climate emissions, is to eliminate them: we should be aiming for a&lt;br>
civilization that produces no net emissions, and we should be aiming to live in&lt;br>
that civilization here in the developed world by 2050. . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do that, we need an &amp;ldquo;energy miracle.&amp;rdquo; We need energy solutions that don't&lt;br>
yet exist, released through a global push for clean energy innovation. That, in&lt;br>
turn, demands that a generation of entrepreneurs push forward new ideas for&lt;br>
renewable energy, unleashing &amp;ldquo;1,000 promising ideas.&amp;rdquo; He described one of his&lt;br>
own investments, but went on to note that we need hundreds of other ambitious&lt;br>
companies as well, and he plans to put his own efforts into this arena.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is this important? The news stories focused largely on the clean energy&lt;br>
aspect of the speech, and certainly the world's most successful businessman&lt;br>
announcing that clean energy is the next frontier is a big headline. However, I&lt;br>
think though that the real breakthrough was not Gates&amp;rsquo; answer to the problem,&lt;br>
but his definition of success: zero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bright green advocates understand that we need &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010070.html">prosperity without&lt;br>
planetary impact&lt;/a>. In many of the circles I run in, this is an&lt;br>
uncontroversial idea, and, indeed, the conversation has moved on, to discussing&lt;br>
how we decouple better lives from &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006650.html">ecological&lt;br>
footprints&lt;/a> (or even go beyond, and build a society that &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004509.html">restores the ecosystems&lt;br>
on which it depends&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To say, however, that the standard of zero impact is not widely understood&lt;br>
and endorsed would be a whopping understatement. Most people rarely see the&lt;br>
things they do, buy and use as directly part of the living systems of the&lt;br>
planet. Few people who do think of their connection to nature have ever&lt;br>
conceived their lives designed to have no impact at all. For most people, a ten&lt;br>
percent or twenty percent improvement sounds like a big deal — in large part&lt;br>
because the improvements they're most familiar with involve giving things up.&lt;br>
When they do encounter it, the idea of &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; looms like a giant wall of&lt;br>
deprivation in front of them. The idea that zero might not be the end of the&lt;br>
good life, but in fact the beginning of a much better way of life, is simply&lt;br>
inconceivable to the vast, vast majority of them. When we talk zero, we sound&lt;br>
crazy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But when Bill Gates talks zero, he sounds visionary. Gates, whatever else he&lt;br>
did Friday, just made the most important idea on the planet mainstream credible.&lt;br>
That's a big, big deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This was all well and good and at this point in the article I was thinking, yeah, so what.  None of this is new and we have litigated it and people with my belief system about the world seem to be largely losing at every corner (e.g., see Obama @ Copenhagen).  At the end of the article Steffen wrote something that truly resonated with me and largely fits squarely within my own unique world-view.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The energy intensity of any given form of prosperity can, I believe, be improved&lt;br>
quite a bit; but the idea that E can be dramatically improved without improving&lt;br>
the kind of prosperity we're attempting to provide is the very definition of&lt;br>
what I call &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010947.html">The&lt;br>
Swap&lt;/a>. The Swap doesn't work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we don't need it to. The idea that contemporary suburban American&lt;br>
lifestyles (the kind of prosperity most people around the world aspire to,&lt;br>
thanks to Hollywood and advertising), the idea that McMansions, SUVs and fast&lt;br>
food chicken wraps somehow represent the best form of prosperity we could&lt;br>
possibly invent is, of course, obviously ludicrous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can reinvent what prosperity means and how it works, and, in the process&lt;br>
both reduce the ecological demands of that prosperity and improve the quality of&lt;br>
our lives. In most cases, this is a smarter approach than simply improving&lt;br>
efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to the problem of cars and automotive emissions, for instance, &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007800.html">isn't designing a&lt;br>
better car, it's designing a better city&lt;/a>. The answer to the problem of&lt;br>
overconsumption isn't recycling cans or green shopping, it's changing our&lt;br>
relationship to stuff, so that everything we use and live with is designed for&lt;br>
&lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/008176.html">zero waste&lt;/a>, and&lt;br>
either meant to last (&amp;ldquo;heirloom design&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;durability&amp;rdquo;) or to be shared&lt;br>
(&amp;ldquo;product service systems&amp;rdquo;) or both. The best living we've ever had is waiting&lt;br>
beyond zero. What looks like a wall to many people from this side of zero, looks&lt;br>
to like a trellis from the other side, a foundation on which &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006915.html">new thinking&lt;/a> can&lt;br>
flourish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cities are the tools we need for reinventing prosperity. &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010941.html">We can build&lt;br>
zero-impact cities&lt;/a>, and we need to. Any answer to the problem of climate&lt;br>
change needs to be as focused on reinventing the future as powering it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This, I must say, is one of the biggest things I've learned while living in Africa.  Here I understand *exactly *where my water comes from.  I've gone to see the system of wells and the water pipes which run them the 30 km or so here to H'town.  I've seen the power generation plants for the city and talked with their engineers.  I know exactly where my food and the things I see in the market come from (all I had to do was walk around lower Dubai for 20 minutes).  I know exactly where my trash ends up (burned or lying outside my gate in a pile. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Africa has taught me in a way that being Green in America never could, that all the crap that is around.  That crap comes from somewhere and it goes somewhere.  Sure, I've seen huge dumps in America as I've driven around.  But those don't have anywhere near the impact on my personal consumption as does seeing a burnt can of probably beans that I ate twelve months ago sitting in a pile outside my compound which I have to drive past every day.  That did, in fact, make a huge impact on my personal consumption.  Not necessarily driving me to deprivation, but driving me to seek more authenticity in my actions – grow your own vegetables, build things for yourself. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I see the value in the flaws of the things around me which I've built and despite their flaws (or maybe because of them) I value these things more.  Sure, maybe my tomatoes are small, but I grew them in a way that not only helped out the longevity of the soil they were grown in but also in a way which positively affected those within my community.  For every one tomato I eat, my staff eat ten or twenty.  Instead of buying so much meat and rice they have all expanded their diets due to the ease and proximity of our garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another massive thing which Africa has taught me is that really to change behavior you have to change the incentive structure.  And this is where I think Steffen gets it correct.  Because for whatever reason of utility America and by extension the world value suburbia, McMansions and whatever else he said.  When I was small I remember those being my metrics for success.  When I was in college I remember telling people that those were the types of things that I wanted. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, I have realized that now I don't necessarily want those things.  What I do want is authenticity and to be in harmony with the community and ecosystem around me.  The one thing I will say, and the biggest problem I have with suburbia is this notion of authenticity.  It just predominately lacks soul, &lt;em>and a bit of stank&lt;/em>.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I've realized how I changed my own behavior I have tried my best to extend that into my day job by always trying to change the behavior patterns of politicians by helping them to realign their own incentive structures.  More on that for another day.  Suffice it to say for now, but I am not shy about stating that fact.  At its core governance work in the developing world boils down to an intellectual conflict between the way the developed world thinks about its citizens and how the developing world thinks about its citizens.  I'm speaking broadly here and of course there are contrarian anecdotes, but in any event that is how I see things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/worldchanging_fulltext/~3/lmi5w0ft-Qc/010978.html">second article&lt;/a> was more mainstream green thinking.  I didn't see to much in it that resonated with me personally.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Everyone Funding Startups!!! &lt;a href="http://www.growvc.com/main/index.html">Grow VC&lt;/a>&lt;br>
is the first global crowdfunding tool for web and mobile startups.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a fantastic idea, which compliments so nicely with Kiva.  My only critique is that it is very tech focused.  Although it makes a&lt;br>
logical entry point for oversight reasons (primarily), I hope that they&lt;br>
will open it up to other sectors.  Everyday I meet business people&lt;br>
here in Africa with fantastic ideas.  The capital flight from Africa has&lt;br>
created a situation where they cannot get access to mid-level funding. &lt;br>
Grow VC fills a very important gap in the finance world and I wish&lt;br>
them nothing but success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the notion of capital flight, this is a major problem.  I heard a&lt;br>
story recently about a high-level East African politician who had&lt;br>
acquired a large sum of money but was having trouble getting the French&lt;br>
banks to accept it.  Number one comment: good for the French banks.  But&lt;br>
number two: if the African elites continue to put their money in developed&lt;br>
world banks, their SMEs are going to continue to lack access to&lt;br>
capital.  If they could decide to bring some of that money back and then&lt;br>
the banks in their own countries could leverage that money via lending&lt;br>
to SMEs Africa would develop a lot faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honestly, development has a place but all the weeping for the world&lt;br>
is tiring.  Let us stop whining and act.  Grow VC has done just that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1204/1224260043076.html">http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1204/1224260043076.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last December a bomb exploded in Mogadishu.  Actually, it was the 4th of December. I didn’t remember the date until I looked it up just &lt;a href="http://http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1204/1224260043076.html">now&lt;/a>.  Pictures like the one at the left pretty much fit most people’s world view of Somalia.  Yet, I live here and I have a completely different view of the situation. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left my house on the day in question about about 2 or so in the afternoon.   I walked out of the gigantic green gate which is the entrance to our compound via the embedded regular sized door and stopped for a few moments to chat with my body guards who would be walking with me the 200 m or so to my friend’s house. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one left to go grab a jacket and something to drink, another of them and I were chatting in Somalglish.  He told me that there had been a bomb that day in Mogadishu.  I didn’t think that much about it as bombs are always going off in Mogadishu.  I replied, “OK.”  If I got too worked up every time I heard that someone had died violently, or that a militia was now mobilizing, or that this area or that area was on the verge of complete and utter dissolution then I would have gone insane long ago. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moments after the guard who would be accompanying me returned and we headed off to my friends.  I have no idea what I may have been pondering during the time, but it surely was brilliant and had nothing to do with the bomb. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I arrived at my friend’s house everyone was particularly chatty that day.  I took my assigned seat in the circle which all eight or so of us occupy with regularity.  We sit on the floor due to a legend that if you chew qat while sitting on cushions you’ll get indigestion.  No one was that worked up, but the radio had not yet come on and the power in my friend’s house doesn’t turn on until 4 pm or so. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that it was about 3 when VOA Somali is aired.  My friend Maal loves his little radio and he loves the VOA – which has only been operating for the past six months or so.  Prior to that everyone received their news via BBC Somali’s radio service.  When VOA came in, for whatever reason, they tromped BBC – which swelled my national pride at the expense of my wife’s. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, VOA came on and everyone listened with horror to the headline.  There had been a suicide bomb at a medical school graduation in Mogadishu that day.  Slowly the information came out.  And then the power came on and we instantly turned on al Jazeera.  The pictures were horrible.  As the afternoon wore on I grew angrier and angrier by the moment. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one had there was the human tragedy part of the story.  The kids that were graduating had known war their *entire *lives.  Most likely they had heard gun shots almost everyday that they’ve been born.  They had likely been subjected to the sounds of mortars at least once a month going into the depths of their memories. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>They had been subjected to social pressures unimaginable to me. Sure, we all have to deal with peer pressure, but many of the peers of these kids were beyond violent gangsters long, long ago.  They had rejected the pressure to take up a gun – and they had found a way to stay in school.  Likely they did not always finish their homework as when it got dark, it got *dark.  *They probably did not have working generators for significant portions of their childhoods – making studying after sunset next to impossible unless you can catch some cars driving by (but this is Mogadishu and there aren’t that many of them).  The list goes on and on, and kids all over Africa have gone through these horrors which make our childhood complaints so minuscule.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet, these kids had rejected the easy route that so many of those their age had taken on.  Indeed, they had not only rejected the route of violence, they had taken a decided opposite route.  I make this joke about how after graduating undergraduate with an engineering degree I decided to become a Marine and blow things up instead of building them.  These kids made the correct choice, which is the opposite of mine.  They decided to put *people *back together instead of blowing people up.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us not look at this with rose colored glasses and think that, well, they had made a financial decision.  Doctors in south-central Somalia are like teachers in the US, well-respected but under-compensated. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this day, this day was a chance to celebrate.  A chance to turn their finely tuned sense of danger off.  A chance to relax their tension for a small time.  A chance for their parents who equally sacrificed throughout to engage in the age old parental paradigm: to be proud of their offspring.  A chance for redemption, that they had beaten all the forces which have colluded against their academic success. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then…. B    O    O     M.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no way to imagine.  Now, almost two months after the event my heart still breaks when I try to imagine the scene. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>That day, here with my friends, almost all eight of us were brought to tears.  The rest of them are all older Somali men.  And not prone to over-sensitivity. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I oscillated.  My emotions swung from extreme horror and sadness about the actual explosion to anger because of what had cause the explosion.  Back and forth through the afternoon.  Back and forth as the information came out.  Back and forth as the videos were shown on al Jazeera.  Back and forth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The anger stemmed from the realization that this is a new phenomenon in Somalia.  See, Mogadishu has been an utter mess for well over twenty years.  However, it has been a mess that has been (by all Somali accounts) largely navigable.  Things were oddly predictable if you understood the situation well.  The Somali conflict has been (prior to the most recent couple of years) largely distinct from other African conflicts.  Civilian casualties have been quite low.  Rape, mass slaughter, amputations, rampant drug use, cannibalism, all of the horror that sells newspapers and funds NGOs has largely been absent from the Somali conflict.  I do not try to minimize the trials of those in Mogadishu, I’m simply saying that vis a vis Sierra Leone for instance things are very different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those that have lived in Mogadishu have been able to more or less live, despite the limitations. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, things have been changing rapidly in south-central Somalia.  The “invasion” by the Ethiopians did not spawn it.  In fact, that was quite conventional warfare mixed with a conventional insurgency.  It was after the Ethiopians withdrew when Mogadishu experienced its first suicide bomb.  If I remember correctly it was a vehicle-borne IED detonated in front of an AMISOM compound – no one was hurt. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few months later, in October 2008 three coordinated suicide bombs went off here in the capital of the north.  It was a dark day, and a pivotal day.  In more ways than the devastation, it was Somalia’s 9/11.  By that I mean it was a watershed event and marks a disjunctive point in time where everything before and everything after must be interpreted in very different ways. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Admittedly the frequency of suicide attacks and other advanced insurgent tactics based upon the violence against civilians is much lower in Mogadishu than in Afghanistan or Iraq.  And, yet, the frequency is steadily increasing.  Here in the north, in the town that marks the boundary between the north-eastern and northern sections of what the world knows as Somalia has been a mess for the past few weeks. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A suicide bomber strapped himself up, and gave his friend the remote detonator.  He intended to walk into the hotel where some Ministers and other officials were staying and have his friend detonate him.  This tactic was largely developed by the Palestinians to ensure that the human delivering the explosive did not get cold feet about the situation.  However, and for whatever reason, the friend pushed the remote detonator when the strapped friend was 200 m or so from the hotel.  No one was hurt, except for the strapped friend.  The legs of that man are intact, but the rest was decimated. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This all represents the genesis of my anger on that day last December.  For years and years, Somali society like the kids who stayed in school, have resisted the more awful aspects of war.  Yes all war is terrible, but in my mind there are degrees.  And suicide bombings is about the lowest one can get tactically.  For whatever reason, Somali society has not been able to hold back the tendency to engage in these tactics.  Maybe it is foreign fighters coming in.  Maybe AQ is there in the south and training fighters.  Maybe it is copycat-ism. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no idea, but it makes me angry.  Because the only result of this situation is that more people.  Real people.  People that do not deserve to die.  Will die. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>No many people who grew up on my circumstances of life – middle-class in the developed world – understand what it feels like to have a country you love invaded.  But there, on that floor, on that day I began to understand what the Iraqis may have felt when a friend of mine hoisted an American flag over Saddam’s face. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>What struck me the most, besides the anger and the sadness, was the utter feeling of hopelessness.  Long ago I put down a gun and picked up books.  I decided that my brain and my words were the weapons that I personally wielded the best.  Part of me, on that particular day, regretted that decision.  Because I just wanted to &lt;em>do something&lt;/em>.  And yet, what can words or logic or reason achieve?  That is the question.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>All I do know is that I have to continue to hope and to try.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The other thing which troubles me is that they seem to assume that just because Shabaab has announced that they are al Qaeda, that means that they are.  While the specifics of this are less than opaque, the evidence they point to is rather dismal.  There is a lot of counter-evidence that Shabaab is largely peopled by Islamist wannabes.  Personally, I lean toward the latter.  I think that largely Shabaab is a rebranded insurgency with Islamist claims in order to secure financing.  Yet, it is complex, as there are solid reports that some of the leadership of Shabaab has been trained by AQ and retains its linkages.  This leads me to believe that there is a split within the organization, but more on that at a latter date. &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is big news for anyone still trying to read the tea leaves on the Somali insurgency, not least becuase in all honesty, this is really no insurgency at all. It's a parallel government. On any day of the week, it would be easy to point to a map and argue that more of Somalia's territory is run by Shabaab and its allies control than by the Transitional Federal Government (despite rather &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/30/world/AP-AF-Somalia.html">optimistic claims&lt;/a> to the contrary). So if Shabaab is the al Qaeda affiliate it claims to be, that means that Somalia is being de facto run by a terrorist group. Yikes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paragraph below I heartily endorse and agree with from what little I’ve seen.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I have to wonder if the United States really gets all of this. As the last decade of conflict has shown us, chaos — a category in which Somalia has no competitors –  is perhaps the best predictor of 21st Century security ills. And from civil conflict to terrorism to refugees and the plight of disease, Somalia has it all. But it's precisely for that reason that the Somalia portfolio has been a hot potato within the U.S. government — bouncing from agency to agency and advisor to advisor with no clear owner or no clear line. It's probably less that U.S. policymarkers are &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60U18B20100131">ignoring Somalia&lt;/a> (as the African Union suggested this weekend) as they are overwhelmed. A fair excuse, but a dangerous one as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The second article is &lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/02/03/are_the_pirates_linked_to_the_islamists">here&lt;/a>.  This, I think, is even lazier reporting. &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Somalia has two big scourges these days: Islamist milititas the run most of the country (and are &lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/02/01/somali_insurgents_announce_their_allegiance_to_al_qaeda">linked to al Qaeda&lt;/a>) and piracy off the coast. (The combination yields a desperate humanitarian situation sandwiched in between.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what if the two scourges are linked? That was the  suggestion of the Kenyan Vice President Kalonzo Stephen Musyok, speaking at the &lt;a href="http://www.newamerica.net/events/2010/kenyan_somali_border">New America Foundation&lt;/a> today. &amp;ldquo;Piracy is another issue which I think has a  direct link with these extremist militant groups,&amp;rdquo; he told the audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's an odd idea at first. Al Shabaab has built its image on the harsh brand of Sharia that they hope to impose, and during the Islamic Courts government earlier this decade (of which al Shabaab was a part, piracy was banned. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not anymore. Last December, a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2295946">Canadian intelligence report&lt;/a> indicated that Shabaab was in fact training pirates for their &amp;ldquo;duties.&amp;rdquo; Further reporting from &lt;em>Jane's&lt;/em> (&lt;a href="http://centralasiaonline.com/cocoon/caii/xhtml/en_GB/features/caii/features/2009/04/16/feature-03">summarized here&lt;/a>) notes how taxes are levied on the pirates&amp;rsquo; booties. Yes, the pirates and the Islamists are definitely in cahoots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way they know that both are getting worse? &amp;ldquo;[I]n Nairobi today, property prices today are still rising, and we think this has a direct link with the piracy.&amp;rdquo; In other words, all those wealthy pirates are &lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/01/04/somali_pirates_driving_up_kenyan_real_estate_prices">buying up fancy homes&lt;/a>. And they've got a lot of cash to spend.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>While I cannot disagree with the quotes, the real evidence that I see exists on a map.  The major pirate networks are not in the south, which is where Shabaab is.  They are in Puntland, which has seen Shabaab incursions recently, but nowhere near to the level that I see this linkage blossom.  I do agree with Dickenson’s analysis that this is something to watch closely.  However, the evidence that pirates are buying houses and driving up property prices in Nairobi (in Isley neighborhood specifically) shows me nothing other than they have nothing else they can buy in Puntland.  Sure there are a few pirate networks that have developed in the South, but these pale in comparison to the networks which are operating with impunity up north.  Perhaps the cited Canadian intel report is correct, but that barely proves the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This illustrates one of my major beefs with living and being here.  The analysis is so shotty.  On the one hand, there are complex issues here, and Somali society isn’t the easiest to figure out.  Yet it isn’t the most complex society to figure out, and when you have a handle on it, it is relatively easy to work out what is happening. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So maybe I need to do more commenting, with the hopes that it may be able to change some of the rhetoric and analysis a small bit.&lt;/p>
