The evidence is in economic publications, in NGO marketing documents, and in artistic memes. This is an important predicate for enabling the accountability mechanisms which will solidify progress to be triggered.</description></item><item><title>I&amp;#8217;m Supposed to Write on Water, but I Don&amp;#8217;t Have Any&amp;#8230;</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-10-15-supposed-write-water-any/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-10-15-supposed-write-water-any/</guid><description>Today the Interweb Gods have deemed is World Blog about water day. Or likely more accurately, the brilliant charity:Water marketers have deemed today as world blog about water:Day. I haven't read every post I have seen come across my various Twitter wires, but the ones I've read talk about the need for us to have water. Seems pretty self-evident and so the rhetoric can turn into a polemic rather quickly. I thought about writing a love post to water, but then I realized that I'm annoyed at water.</description></item><item><title>Chinese Powered Self-Sufficiency in Africa</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-05-26-chinese-powered-self-sufficiency-africa/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 May 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-05-26-chinese-powered-self-sufficiency-africa/</guid><description>Madam President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf the current President of Liberia did a remarkable thing yesterday.  She [told ][2]the world that in ten years Liberia would be self-sufficient and able to stand on its own feet with only further investment &lt;em>and no aid&lt;/em>.</description></item><item><title>Understanding War [in Mogadishu]</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-04-17-understanding-war-in-mogadishu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-04-17-understanding-war-in-mogadishu/</guid><description>This week the World Food Program (WFP) shoved out a press release about how piracy was raising food prices in South-Central Somalia. At first glance, most people who would read such a report will likely think, oh the poor people in Mogadishu. Of course, I share their sentiments. However, there is a deeper issue at work here. One that I'm not sure many people realize. The conclusion (because I'm a lawyer and we put these things up front) is that this rise in cost of business may have drastically good effects for the conflict in the South. Here's how I get there.</description></item><item><title>Franchising in Africa: An Annotated Reading</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-02-24-franchising-in-africa-an-annotated-reading/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-02-24-franchising-in-africa-an-annotated-reading/</guid><description>This week's annotated reading is from Dalberg (who I had not heard of before) and it deals with the lack of McDonalds around Africa.  Original article [here ]&lt;a href="pdf">1&lt;/a>, my thoughts below.</description></item><item><title>Gates goes to TED and Few Listen</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-02-16-gates-goes-to-ted-and-few-listen/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-02-16-gates-goes-to-ted-and-few-listen/</guid><description>I didn't hear about this until after the fact.  Indeed quite after the fact.  I was reading tweets about how Gates was blowing people's minds at cocktail parties leading up to his big speech about climate change at TED this year.  But then I forgot about them until reading these two articles from [Worldchanging][1].</description></item><item><title>Grow &amp;#8211; Venture Capital 2.0</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-02-16-grow-venture-capital-2-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-02-16-grow-venture-capital-2-0/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

Last December a bomb exploded in Mogadishu. Actually, it was the 4th of December. I didn’t remember the date until I looked it up just now. Pictures like the one at the left pretty much fit most people’s world view of Somalia. Yet, I live here and I have a completely different view of the situation. I left my house on the day in question about about 2 or so in the afternoon.</description></item><item><title>FP gets it semi-correct on Somalia</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-02-04-fp-gets-it-semi-correct-on-somalia/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-02-04-fp-gets-it-semi-correct-on-somalia/</guid><description>FP usually does really good analysis, but I am concerned by a couple of blog posts they have published recently.  The first is [here][1].  While I understand that they are trying to simplify a very complex issue, this is just lazy.  Especially for a group of mostly informed readers.  While I agree with their analysis that Shabaab is running a parallel government (to some extent), it is no where near as pervasive as, for instance, Greater Liberia was.  Shabaab have not issued their own currency, do not enforce “borders” in the same manner, etc. etc.</description></item><item><title>My Own Private Pirate Expedition</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2009/2009-09-09-my-own-private-pirate-expedition/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2009/2009-09-09-my-own-private-pirate-expedition/</guid><description>I am trying to return to some modicum of consistency with respect to the exhibitionist nature of this activity.</description></item><item><title>An Homage to My Environment (aka Thanks for the Birthday Greetings)</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2009/2009-09-03-an-homage-to-my-environment-aka-thanks-for-the-birthday-greetings/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2009/2009-09-03-an-homage-to-my-environment-aka-thanks-for-the-birthday-greetings/</guid><description>For those which are curious as to a H-town, birthday this is how it broke down.</description></item><item><title>Tonight the Following Occured&amp;#8230;</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-09-12-tonight-the-following-occured/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-09-12-tonight-the-following-occured/</guid><description>&lt;ul>

interesting article the other day about how AFRICOM has been received on the continent.  The gist of the article contains two interrelated theorems: (1) that Bush's rhetorical fascination with terrorism has pigeon-holed his foreign policy measures that have little to do with terrorism; (2) that African leaders and American policy makers are like Somali Pirates and French Sailors passing each other quietly in the night with little understanding of the other.</description></item><item><title>Arrival

My time is starting to wind down here now and I feel compelled to clean some things up.  Not yet sure when I’m going to leave Salone, but it is going to be soon.  I think that the absolute latest I will be here will be the 20th, which is only three weeks and two weekends from now.  The soonest I’ll be able to leave will be mid-week next week.  For a lot reasons I’m over this place.  People are leaving at the speed of naught, the rains are coming and we have no Tv, new people are replacing the old and I cannot be bothered to get to know them when I’m such a short timer, and at any event no matter where you are it is difficult when you are a short timer.  I just want to do the few remaining things and get the muck out of here.</description></item><item><title>too

surprising and wonderful.  my friends had been planning for all week to go upcountry, but seeing that it was highlands next to last weekend here and it was looking like we would be able to spend a good deal of time together that was more important to me.  i thought i could figure out a way to get upcountry later, even though the rains are coming (btw i know now what the phrase feels like…at least a little bit).  then due to some work-related B.S. it turned out that highlands was going to have to work ALL weekend.</description></item><item><title>my little jazz place</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-04-29-my-little-jazz-place/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-04-29-my-little-jazz-place/</guid><description>so for much of my life i have had this fantasy that i would eventually find a jazz club that would replace in my mind the absence of me not being alive in the late 50′s and early 60′s and being black and living in NYC and therefore unable to stoll down 52d street and hear coltrane and others jamming in real-time and only for themselves.  although i’ve been all over the states, i have yet to find anything that feels/is truly authentic.  everything just seems, kitchy or not good enough to be authentic and have great jaz artists.  i think i came close, in my mind at least, to finding the proper environs in this smoky little underground club on the left banc of paris.  but the artists that cam and i saw there were not totally up to par with my fantasy!</description></item><item><title>Isle de HOLY

trip. The first is this little artist community that exists on Isle de Goree a thirty minute ferry ride from Dakaar. The second will come later.

Isle de Goree has, at various times, been a defensive position protecting the bay where the port of Dakaar is and/or a slave exporting island. Most times the slave traders would take slaves to islands off the coast of West Africa and then barter with the transportation people there on the island.</description></item><item><title>senegalese music</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-04-06-senegalese-music/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-04-06-senegalese-music/</guid><description>i leave for senegal in just a bit on Sloc, some airline that has a less stellar safety record…apparently.  although from what I’ve heard they aren’t as bad as others in west africa, so maybe i’ll be ok.  plus they play backstreet boys loud and on the speakers so everyone is able to enjoy the festivities.</description></item><item><title>still alive</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-03-28-still-alive/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-03-28-still-alive/</guid><description>sorry. not dead, just lost.  no days off, but at least the work is interesting.  we file april 4th, so i will have a life again after that. looking forward to my trip to senegal and the gambia the 6th through the 15th.  right now there is a heated euro politico debate in my office between a right wing german-swiss and a left wing french-swiss. it’s awesome!</description></item><item><title>i little trip to the mall</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-03-06-i-little-trip-to-the-mall/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-03-06-i-little-trip-to-the-mall/</guid><description>![190207_1921][1]i hate malls. i really really hate everything about them. i hate how large they are. i hate that massive retention ponds must be created to pool the flow of water that is not allowed to seep into the ground properly over a dissipated region, but is instead pooled in isolated areas. the outsourcing of the environmental degredation annoys me. i hate how they all are the same, one or two paradigms determine the layout. i hate the food they sell. i hate that they are owned by all of us who own mutual funds and don’t really care where our money goes to except for the fact that we get something towards our retirement golf community dream.</description></item><item><title>leadership challenges</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-02-28-leadership-challenges/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-02-28-leadership-challenges/</guid><description>This ![160207_0812][1]post is long overdue.  But forgive me, it took a while for me to have a chance to pull the pictures off my phone.  Let me introduce you to the people that have a chance, everyday, to steal my shit and for some reason do not.</description></item><item><title>Pictures</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-02-28-pictures/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-02-28-pictures/</guid><description>Added more picts today to the album.</description></item><item><title>Beaches &amp;amp;

hello.
this weekend was pretty amazingly long. in a good way i guess. except for i had a lot of work that could have been done, but i never got around to it. it is mitigated by the fact that none of it was actually due this weekend, i just wanted to get started on it. that can happen later i guess.
the weekend basically began on wednesday when we hosted our own welcome aboard party and some friends came over for american game night.</description></item><item><title>the grapefruits have more seeds.</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-02-02-the-grapefruits-have-more-seeds/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Feb 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-02-02-the-grapefruits-have-more-seeds/</guid><description>[![N557965146_50950_9850][2]][2] on sunday afternoon/evening there was a marching band parade and people just went into this compound (the wall is the background of the picture). they paraded to a compound. this picture doesn’t do it justice b/c there were TONS of people. later we found out that it was a thanksgiving parade. each local school has their own thanksgiving holiday where they march to a church. not sure about the significance of it all, but it was funny nonetheless.</description></item><item><title>And the soapboxing begins&amp;#8230;</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-01-30-and-the-soapboxing-begins/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-01-30-and-the-soapboxing-begins/</guid><description>[![Image001][2]][2]

And from another axis.
This city so far has been exactly what I had expected. It is fulfilling the picture I had in created over the six months or so of anticipation. People who have been here longer than I tend to ask the obvious question to fill the small talk obligation. “So how do you like Freetown.</description></item><item><title>First of Some</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-01-23-first-of-some/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-01-23-first-of-some/</guid><description>Things have been a bit chaotic with getting settled and then having that paper and another project for school hanging over my head. I finished the paper yesterday and the project just now, so I feel very refreshed. Now I can focus fully on the work here and then having fun. The beaches are delightful, apparently, and I’m excited to visit them soon.</description></item></channel></rss>
