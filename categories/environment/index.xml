non-force-ment of normatively superior products.  Perhaps it gives them something to talk about at parties, a consumer status-symbol.  Whatever the case, now there is a labeling standard for biofuels.  From [Triple Pundit][1]:</description></item><item><title>Saddling up the Saharan

problem?  Why is it taking so long for the Middle Easy countries (especially) to figure out the technology and apply the economies of scale such that desalination costs will fall for the rest of the world?  Well, [Worldwatch Institute][1] provides an update.  The summary:</description></item><item><title>Way to Go

is a carbon exchange that is modelled on a social justice model.  Basically a domestic, small-scale implementations of the Clean-Development Mechanisms embodied in the [Kyoto Protocol][2].  The theory is that the rich nations help the poor because of the intertwined nature of humanity.  The principle of technology transfer and that the rich pay is embodied in most international environmental treaties, but was interesting in the Kyoto schema in that offsets that assist the development of an emerging market or under-developed country may be applied to the quota for the developed country that pays.  It is a nice integration of standard liberalist philosophy.  I like it when there is overlap.  I am not sure what the economists may say about these mechanisms, but I certainly like them.</description></item><item><title>Competition to give green lighting to
