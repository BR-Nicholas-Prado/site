I usually refrain from such things, but I think it is a good opportunity to show how &lt;em>normal&lt;/em> everything is here. With a few caveats.</description></item><item><title>On Transparency &amp;amp; Openness in Organizational Behavior</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-10-27-transparency-openness-organizational-behavior/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-10-27-transparency-openness-organizational-behavior/</guid><description>I have been a technophile for a long time; indeed, as long as I can remember I've had a computer and used it extensively. Many of my &amp;lsquo;mentors&amp;rsquo; for creating an organization are companies which are currently operating in the technology sector rather than in the legal sector, because being open is more efficient than being closed. Openness is well and good, but there are a few tensions which any organization must navigate in this area.</description></item><item><title>Annotated Reading: So THAT is Why I Don&amp;#8217;t Fit In</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-06-04-annotated-reading-fit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-06-04-annotated-reading-fit/</guid><description>| This week I read a fascinating article which was written by a former high-level DFID individual named Rosalind Eyben.

re-programmed its intercept missiles (which were built to intercept anti-ship missiles launched from Russian planes in the event of full scale war against the Soviets) to take out satellites in space.  Maybe it is my love of Spies Like Us, but if it only took the Navy three weeks to perform the software calibration on these things then that means that it either wasn’t that complicated or that they had been working on it for much longer than they are releasing.  My theory is that it isn’t that complicated, because satellites should be easier to track and know where they are in 3-Ds then missiles launched.</description></item><item><title>leaving&amp;#8230;on a jet plane</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-10-05-leaving-on-a-jet-plane/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05

be.  i just hopped in the car and left my paradices.  i might have purposefully made some subconscious hedge by going to jackson first and then leaving the west.  easing my way out of the hot tub by sitting on the side with only your feet in before you race into the house over the snow littered deck….?  not
