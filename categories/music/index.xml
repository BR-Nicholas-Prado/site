&lt;p>When you sit with people from other countries, it is important to have some fall back, standardized way to explain where you are from. Of course we all have these icons, these posters, these fleeting images that remind ourselves of where we came from and are readily recalled by our frontal cortex when asked to explain ourselves. When we trust the person and we know that the question is meant because the other conversant(s) truly does want to understand us, then we are more easily able to open up and to tell the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I want to explain American rock music, and in a little bit the America that I know and love, to people who only know of America from what their news and Hollywood tells them I have a go to band. My icon for all that is great and wonderful about American rock music. Wax Fang.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are three dudes from Louisville who just build face melting rock and roll music. It is fast, aggressive, in your face, and musically delicious. In something like 2006 or so I saw them at Exit In for what was then known as Next Big Nashville. I think we were going to see a different band and just happened upon Wax Fang. They melted my face. Since then I’ve seen them a couple of times at the Basement. Always I’ve left with a melted face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three dudes who know how to play their instruments really damn well, who don’t hide behind loops and over-reverb and autotuners. They play straight-forward. The guitarist has some David Gilmour, some Bowie. The bassist is just rock solid. And the drummer may be one of my favorite contemporary drummers. When I put on their La La Land album (particularly while driving because what could be more American than that), and drive all I can do is think of this all screwed up, dirty, aggressive, lovely, caring, wonderful country that we’ve built for ourselves and smile. So without further ramblings…. Wax Fang.&lt;/p>

While I was getting ready for work my phone was streaming an album which I found last night to be ultra-enjoyable. My headphones were with me; so, I plugged them into the phone and started walking. Got to work; sat down at my desk computer to type this; the album is still playing. Seamlessly it has flown to my ears via 4G wireless and .11n wireless. I have not purchased this album, but I’m going to see the band in about 10 days if I’m able.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is our wonderful, vibrant, modern world. Where pop music is crowd-sourced and GOOD. No more do we need to rely on corporate people with obvious biases and conflicting inclinations, torn between their artistic roots and boardroom future, who push out to the masses bubblegum crap. These days bubblegum crap still does OK, but nothing like it did in the 90′s. These days, if you don’t have a real soul, if you lack authenticity, you are less likely to “make” it than in the past. I listened to a Moth podcast by one of the Milli Vanilli guys earlier this week who was talking about how things went down for them. I cannot even imagine that happening. Even the corporate music world (I think) understands that it takes more than a pretty face, great hair, and an ability to dance to make it. Unless you want to be a dancer – which you can. I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you wanted to impress a girl you brought her over, and if she was artsy you figured out a way to let her see your music collection. CDs organized on metal or wooden racks prominently displayed in your room. This is how it was done for decades. Because as was said in High Fidelity, “music, art, television, these things matter, they connect us.” It was a shorthand way to tell her your story in a really interesting way. The tingles of “ohhhhhh, I looooooove this album” and you knew that you had made a connection. Those things were real. Although we are losing the physical objects, it seems to me that the social interaction portion is still very much alive and well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we get to spotify. My friend Frank sent me an invite a couple of weeks ago, and I must say it is only alright if you don’t pay. But then I said let me try their pay service. And a whole new world opened up. It is unbelievable. They have figured out the perfect marriage of a huge library, vibrant community of humans I actually know, along with all my music. What I love about it, is that to be cool on spotify doesn’t matter how big your record collection is, because everyone is operating on the same exact set of tunes. It doesn’t matter if you are a rich person who can afford to spend hundreds on tons of new CD’s or if you are dirt poor and just want to listen to great stuff. You both are operating on the same pay model and have access to the same stuff. We Americans love our individuality and there is something to be said for that, but the Europeans have gone much further than we have in figuring out how to manage communities by sharing. So what &lt;em>does&lt;/em> matter on Spotify. I’m not sure as I’m really new to the community, but I suspect what really matters is not the size or breadth of the money that you have spent on albums but on what you have put together, what you have created, mashed up, and collated. It is is your playlists idiot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s how I’m going to judge you in our amazing, cloudy, pomo world. Have a great day everyone, find some good art, enjoy the hell out of it, smile at your neighbors and dance for no reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you want to know what album I was loving, check out this band.&lt;/p>

Indeed, I think that patriotism now that we are moving into the post-states (for all intents and purposes) world has somehow turned into a dirty word. I’m not sure how that happened. Certainly, for us Americans, being the big, dumb, blumbering dude in a room filled with slicker, sleeker, shinier countries hasn’t helped our cause any.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, see, here’s the thing. We Americans ARE awesome. I mean I wouldn’t go so far as to say that we’re the most awesome (&lt;em>see, e.g.&lt;/em> our deeply teetering economy, our inability to solve any of the major global problems that the rest of the world is desperately looking for some leadership from us, and oh yeah Big Macs).  But we shouldn’t be afraid to say that even given all that, we’re still pretty awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this is where the Norah Jones comes into the equation.  I don’t know if it isn’t cool that I like her music.  *Yeah, all right you think, Come Away With Me as an alright song.  but she’s a bit too “pop-py” for my tastes *(and you would likely draw out the “oooooo” in that word).  But she has really incredible range.  She had great songs from a huge variety of genres.  And even when you try to take away the lens that your inner hipster hatred for the “pop” makes you don and you try to listen to each of her different songs as if they were from an artist who you normally associated with that genre.  In other words when she sings a country song, it is a really good song even if I thought of her whole persona as a country singer.  She’s digging up old slave / civil rights songs.  She’s licking on classic bluegrass and still classic but a bit more mainstream country and jazz songs.  And they all sound really good.  She’s working with tons of different types of people, likely trying finding some of the greatest musicians rolling around New York City right now to dig up exciting new combinations that really work.  And there, in that city, she has elite artists of possibly every single major and most minor musical cultures in the entire world.  It is cliche, but true, only in America.  Nobody else’s got that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, sure, we got our panties in a wad over a freaking mosque being placed two blocks from ground zero, when daily I can’t walk two blocks without hitting at least three mosques wherever I go.  So we got that stuff, but we got cool stuff too.&lt;/p>

in case you’re an ostrich in a human’s body, or my dad, [radiohead has put out a new album][2], called in Rainbows.  it is only downloadable on the internet at this point.  it will come out in CD stores at some point in December, which basically requires you to ask WTF is the point of that.  nevermind.  the interesting thing about this is how they are doing it.  they have decided that there is no price point.  someone can pay anything they like from 1 pence (you pay in pounds…) to as high as you want.  they charge a 44 pence charge on your credit card, so the lowest you can pay is probably about $.90 depending on the exchange rate on a given date.  Nevertheless that is ridiculous.  I’m not going to tell you what I paid, but it was similar to what I pay for iTunes albums.  I will be interested to hear what kind of information they get out of it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the real point here is that the album is rich.  and i don’t mean to speak to its pecuniary interests.  it seems to me, after two not-incredibly close listens, that it is the continuation of a cohesive narrative arc beginning with the bends and running through OK directly to this album.  although it seems to integrate some parts of the kid A/amnesiac sidebar, as well as a lot of the things i enjoyed from hail to the thief.  it seems different than those two albums.  maybe i’ll be editing this later, not sure and recanting on my words.  but for now, that is my thought.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is this band that Highlands and I saw this summer which we both loved called &lt;a href="http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;amp;searchlink=BAJOFONDO&amp;amp;sql=11:hcftxqw0ldse~T0">Bajofondo Tango Club&lt;/a>.  I have described them elsewhere.  They were Argentine and fabulously crazy.  This bank, Gogol Bordello, does to Russia what Bajofondo do to Argentina:  rock its world with a fusion of traditional rhythms and sounds with new beats and sounds.  Gogol is more rock inspired where Bajofondo is more dance inspired, but I think that is more a reflection of the specific musical leanings of each region rather than any specific choice.  There is not much overlap between the two bands that I can type out, however there is a certain parallel of energy between the two when you listen to them. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>maybe two weeks ago some friends of ours told us of an album launch at the YSC (young sportsmen’s club).  thinking that it would be interesting i tried to get a big group of people to go.  i also invited fouday, one of my gaurds, the youngest of them, as i thought it would be a nice night out, although i conceded in my mind that he may be stygmatized by hanging out with white people, i sidelined that thought b/c i thought at the end of the day maybe i can buy his muslim ass enough sodas that he’ll be so sugar-high that maybe he won’t care.  plus it is the whole, i’m white, i want to do good b/c i feel guilty when i think about my life back home, scenario which i have found myself in more times than i can count…almost to the point of cynicism…almost.  that aside, we had a group of people to go to this thing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i had actually met the singer, Paps, at a beachside bar only a few weeks after i arrived.  brett and i went down there for a few beers and met a sort-of-friend and her two friends, one of which is this white brit 24 y/o guy and his friend, a singer: Paps.  The brit has now sunk his lifesavings (whatever that can amount to at 24) into getting Paps album off the ground. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this was to be their big night.  they had booked the place, they had booked, essentially, the entire Salone music scene in order to come out and support Paps’ album launch and then Paps was going to perform.  we got there and it was packed with locals sitting on delipidated chairs on this terrace overlooking tennis courts/basketball courts.  i met fouday and we all went in.  the entrance fee was five thousand leones and the CD was ten thousand, essentially $2 and $4.  we didn’t have to buy the cd’s, but see prior paragraph for why we all did! &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there were about seventy-eight opening acts.  at least it felt like that.  it was so interesting to see.  very communal.  people would come out to &amp;ldquo;sing&amp;rdquo; (why in quotes to come) one song, half a song, two and a half songs.  people would hop up on the stage when they would get excited or a lyric was funny.  people would cross deck and come out on other group’s songs.  we heard, essentially, the entire Salone sound track – every song which we hear every night we go out (there aren’t that many, as this place isn’t that big). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>none of this was much different than watching &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chappelles-Block-Party-Unrated-Widescreen/dp/B000FMH8RG/ref=sr_1_1/102-1712276-6191336?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;qid=1178625457&amp;amp;sr=1-1">dave chappelle’s block party&lt;/a> on showtime, laying on my nice green couch with a beer in hand…except for the sweat and the smells and the bar-b-q chicken which are spicy as hell (frying is expensive).  what WAS different than watching that is that here they only had two mic’s.  one had to stay with the MC for much of the time, but in a pinch it was passed to the performers.  the performers were always messing with the mic, for a minute i couldn’t figure out what was going on.  only after the second performer did i realize what was going on.  these guys didn’t have enough money to produce a backing track so what was happening was they were merely lip syncing.  the fiddling with the mic was them turning it off when the song started and on when it finished so they could talk/dedicate/whatever.  as opposed to when it happens in the states out of laziness or unqualification to be a performer, here it was endearing as these people probably would have loved to have people spinning the backing tracks behind them like the performers on Dave Chappelle’s special, but that simply wasn’t a possibility.  here the only option that they have is to &amp;ldquo;perform&amp;rdquo; by lip singing.  they would a capella from time to time which would be a live performance and i could tell thes few that did this were qualified and had great voices/could rap/whatever. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this experience put into sharp relief something that i had heard before on a BBC special about the history of Sierra Leone music.  Salone used to be a bastion of jazz and blues like much of the rest of west africa: mali and senegal are known for their musicians.  mali claims to be the real birthplace of the blues and senegal claims to be the afro in afro-cubano jazz, etc.  salone used to be very intrumental focused like the rest of west african, lots of drumline, crazy beats.  but since the war began this has changed for a couple of reasons (according to the BBC analysis).  one was the rampant poverty.  prior to the war there was rampant poverty, but there was a priveledged &amp;ldquo;middle-class&amp;rdquo; that was relatively better off than the majority of the populace.  i make no claims to the benefits of this type of system, however instrumental music did flourish under that system.  after the war everything was equalized, equalized downward.  everyone became poorer and suddenly it was much harder to find the $ for instruments.  the second part of it is that all of the archives of Salone music and all the musical instruments that the invaders could find were burned during the Freetown invasion in January, 1999. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the third thing that I think, this was not in the BBC analysis but is only from my superficial observation, is that b/c of the war there was a massive hardening of this society.  gang rap became a standard b/c of the psyiological responses which the rebels were able to create in their footsoldiers and thus they enticed them to fight by giving them drugs and playing tupac.  of course it is much more complex than this, but i think that american gang rap and less militant forms of hip hop took root here in a way that other west african societies seems to lack (outside of liberia which is supposedly very similar to Salone in this regard) due to the necessities of a hard civil war.  it was a coping mechanism as well as an enabling mechanism for the young and not so young soldiers.  at least it makes sense to me that that may be the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so hip hop became the standard and now what happens is that many performers record their voice tracks a capella on whatever they can find whereever they can find it and then send the tracks abroad for some producer they’ve never met, but only emailed, to put backing tracks to.  after a round or two a cd is produced and mp3′s are emailed back here for someone to burn onto a CD. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Know-Im-Not-Alone/dp/B000G8NX9G/ref=sr_1_2/102-1712276-6191336?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;qid=1178625377&amp;amp;sr=1-2">have heard&lt;/a> that musicians in iraq are making music along similar lines, but there the major concern isn’t so much the money as the socially imposed lack of freedom to assemble in anything other than one’s house as well as the rising fundamental muslim extremism who takes issue with hip hop generally and their music specifically. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>nevertheless i think that a more competent than i sociologist could publish a good paper following these trends.  but for now, here is Paps singing about corruption in Salone.  if you want his CD please tell me and i’ll buy here to support the artist and bring it home with me.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think we’re lost, don’t worry&lt;br>
I’ve been here before&lt;br>
I’m sure I thought I knew the way&lt;br>
Out of here yesterday&lt;br>
Dove cuesto, mi dolce?&lt;br>
Your driver called, it’s time to go-&lt;br>
Your driver’s waiting for you-
And I caught a fever&lt;br>
A holy fire-&lt;br>
Til I was crawling on the ceiling&lt;br>
Come out of your hole&lt;br>
I know you know-&lt;br>
You know I know-&lt;br>
I wanna go-&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a pretty thing, i’ve never seen&lt;br>
Someone so perfectly deceive-&lt;br>
I loved her smile-&lt;br>
And her beguiling way with me&lt;br>
She smelled exciting, I wanted some-&lt;br>
Your drivers’ gone-&lt;br>
Like everybody-&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that’s why I need ya-&lt;br>
To catch on fire-&lt;br>
I want you to burn me til I feel it-&lt;br>
I know you know which way to go-&lt;br>
I wantcha to show me&lt;br>
So I can steal it-&lt;br>
Where should we go?&lt;br>
Where should we go?&lt;br>
I knwo you know that I’m&lt;br>
Gonna need it&lt;br>
I know you know which way to go-&lt;br>
I know you know-&lt;br>
I wanna go&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I googled to find the lyrics and this &lt;a href="http://hipspinster.blogspot.com/2004_01_11_archive.html">review&lt;/a> came up.  My favorite words are:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>before i knew the backstory, i viewed this mainly as another skunk-on-the-make album, more tomcatting tunes from the mack daddy of alt-rock/soul. his persona — which, from what i know of him, extends into real life — is that sort of self-pitying compulsive lover-boy who alternately agonizes over and revels in his evilness. fairly irresistible on record; doubtless a nightmare to deal with in reality. but, as someone once said, &amp;ldquo;half the records in my house are made by people i wouldn’t &lt;em>let into&lt;/em> my house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>all is well in africa.  tunes are cranking.  work is cranking.  i’ll have a nice story for you today or tomorrow.  last night we went to this bar that reminded me strikingly of key west, and i’m not sure why.  it was more than the reggae.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>i love you. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>being without you has caused me to do crazy things.  i bought an ipod a day before i leave for africa becuase my last one, with you all up in it, decided to blow the fuck up.  it was a bastard anyway and i was getting jealous of your involvement with it.  it was good to have you back.  i looked at you on my computer, felt you when i packed and listened to you via a long series of cords and conundrums on my latest trip becuase the last ipod….well we won’t talk about that. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i remember our first encounter at the turtles music store in chattanooga the christmas when i got my first cd player.  i was armed with a gift certificate from UD and i wanted to get the first pearl jam album.  the sheep on it made my mom squirmed so i settled on the eric clapton unplugged album.  there were tapes before, but that music was fleeting.  it was my first foray and you cannot fall in love when you are merely experimenting.  but that cd was real.  i still have it in hard and soft form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the transition was difficult for both of us, i know.  when we moved over from cd’s to 0′s and 1′s we both took it hard.  i missed flipping through your plastic, rigged cases.  i think you missed me too.  it was so much easier to travel with you, but harder to communicate with you.  sometimes the screens were impersonal and sometimes it was difficult to find what i really wanted to listen to from your bloated ranks.  in the old days i would have to pull cd’s and put them in my caselogics.  this forced me to choose a smaller subset and would let me focus on making good choices in my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we’ve seen the world together.  and you always are there to remind me of my past, and keep me on the path towards the future whereever that will lead us.  whenever i think of home, parents, family, close friends, ex-girlfriends, places and events there is somewhere in your depths a song that will make your memory more poignant.  i will always remember having to pull off the side of the road because i was crying too hard after mamo died while listening to a dead can dance song.  i will always remember the hope of a new relationship that came while listening to 66 by afghan’s.  i will always remember my marines singing at the top of their lungs california, no doubt about it when we were returning from okinawa on a jet plane.  i will always remember my dad when i play billie joel and my mother when i play norah jones.  there are too many other permanent, cognitive overlaps to list.  suffice it to say you allow me to remember better than i can by myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>you make me a better person.  by reminding me of my past and what value system i have chosen you keep me grounded.  whenever i think that something will be too difficult i put on some bob seger.  whenever i am confused about the present and how it relates to the future i put on the sunscreen song.  whenever i become frustrated with the lack of like-minded individuals around me i put on taylor mali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>you are beautiful, serene, and transformative.  won’t you join me in africa?  thanks.&lt;/p>

last night i went to THIS.  i flashed back to driving to the keys for one of my first times with all the windows down and gb with me.  i was screaming ac/dc at the top of my lungs.  she was laughing her ass off. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.hellsbelles.info/">http://www.hellsbelles.info/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this is a lesbian ac/dc cover band.  there is no other way to say this:  they rock fucking hard.  the chick who covers angus spent most of the show in a black bra and the little plaid skirt.  it was hillarious.  they are from seattle. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>my love of ac/dc did not begin at the beginning.  in fact as a youngster i was a bit intimidated by metal and harder music.  i remember mowing the lawn one sunday with my walkman on listening to my namesake doing his countdown and doctor feelgood came on.  it rocked but it did not really give me a good buzz.  i was pretty equivocal about it in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then came jon meert.  jon meert was my friend jason’s older brother.  the circular part of this story is that jason lives in seattle currently, but that is neither here nor there.  jon meert was a year older than us, but about five years more physically mature.  i think he had a full chest of hair when jason and i were in seventh grade.  he was a bear of a man when we were growing up.  sometimes those that seem large when you see them years later they suddenly are much smaller.  not jon.  when i saw him two or so years ago he was still the large, hairy man that i remembered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>jon drove his mother’s thunderbird.  not just a thunderbird, it was a fucking firebird with removable panels, t-top, black.  it was sick.  it was loud.  it was dirty.  it was low.  it was fast.  jason and i loved making jon (who was sixteen at the time and working at blimpie’s in naples) drive us to the movies or to the beach so we could ride in that fucker.  me, being the late bloomer, was pretty small and didn’t mind riding in the back, as long as jon drove that stick shift fucking car fast with the panels off so my hair can flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that was the summer when i fell in love with rock n roll.  there was something about that car that legitimized GNR, metallica and ac/dc in a way that i had not been able to comprehend before.  there was something incomplete in my picture of rock n roll before jon and his firebird showed me what i means to rock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so jon meert.  for those about to rock.  i salute you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ps-the lead singer was probably the sexiest lesbian i’ve ever seen.  too bad her DSL’s are going to waste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~ # ~&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>summer lawns</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-06-06-summer-lawns/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-06-06-summer-lawns/</guid><description>&lt;p>so i have many reviews and things upon which to comment.  however, those will have to wait until another time. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>for now i wanted to tell you about a fantastic new opportunity for your and your loved ones.  i’m not talking about the pyramid scheme that i’m deeply involved in, although i would love to talk to YOU about that sometime.  maybe we can get a drink, i don’t know you, but i know you’d like to hear what i have to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>summer lawns.  they are a band.  do it.  juff buckley lyrics and voice meets lyrical, well-instrumented music.  it is worth it.  start with the &lt;a href="http://www.kexp.org/podcasting/podcasting.asp#instudio">KEXP Live Podcast&lt;/a> especially the second (or third) song, &amp;ldquo;i’ll drive, you can sleep through the night.&amp;rdquo;  It begins at 9:20 or so on the podcast.  i lost my shit, it slowly ran down my leg as i was walking home from the bus station with my new headphones on, i turned it up to the loudest my iPod could go.  the sweat ran off as the sun, unimpeded by clouds beat my face.  too many driving nights, too many late night coffee’s, hot dogs, nachos, too many times pushing to meet a deadline of a lover awakening or a super bowl party or a father who is anxious to see me for the first time after a way.  driving is what i do.  you all know that.  it is one of the assorted reasons that makes me a sucka for a theme spun upon the basis of travelling in a car. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>just do it. &lt;/p>
