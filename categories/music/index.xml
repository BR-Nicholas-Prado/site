Of course we all have these icons, these posters, these fleeting images that remind ourselves of where we came from and are readily recalled by our frontal cortex when asked to explain ourselves. When we trust the person and we know that the question is meant because the other conversant(s) truly does want to understand us, then we are more easily able to open up and to tell the truth.</description></item><item><title>What Spotify Means for our Consumptive Tendencies</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-09-08-what-spotify-means-for-our-consumptive-tendencies/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-09-08-what-spotify-means-for-our-consumptive-tendencies/</guid><description>I have been using Spotify for only a couple of days but already it seems that it is supporting rather than detracting from the way the world is going. These days it is less about what you've bought and more about what you've created. It's a great time to be alive.</description></item><item><title>Why I Love America, Norah Jones Edition</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-11-07-norah-jones-love-america/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-11-07-norah-jones-love-america/</guid><description>When you live abroad sometimes it is difficult to express the fact that you are, at heart, a patriot. Indeed, I think that patriotism now that we are moving into the post-states (for all intents and purposes) world has somehow turned into a dirty word. I'm not sure how that happened.</description></item><item><title>New Music Friday</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-02-02-new-music-friday/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-02-02-new-music-friday/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Yael Naim</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-01-31-yael-naim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jan 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-01-31-yael-naim/</guid><description>So, if you like the new commercials for Air Jordan’s, I mean [Mac Air ][1]then you likely have wondered who the hell is singing that song and why does it make me so happy.  Well the answer is [Yael Naim][2] to the first question, the song is New Soul.  Apparently she is French, cause the rest of her self-titled album is in French, and there is a song titled Paris.  The answer to the second question, at least for me, is that it makes me want to go to happy things.  It begins an entire stream of day dreaming which inevitably ends somewhere happy.  Not sure what your answer will be.  Her video for the song is below.</description></item><item><title>It&amp;#8217;s Time for Christmas Tunes</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-11-27-its-time-for-christmas-tunes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Nov 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-11-27-its-time-for-christmas-tunes/</guid><description>[![Xmasto][2]][2]Have been listening to John Denver’s Christmas Album. Recorded in 1979, John Denver’s Album “A Christmas Together”
featuring the inchoate inventives of Jim Henson’s LCD flashbacks is officially
one of the trippiest albums ever recorded and produced in a recording studio. Check out track 11, it will blow your mind.
