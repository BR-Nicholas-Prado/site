There is a spectrum from purely public (government driven) to purely private (corporate driven) delivery of services. When we think about this as a spectrum rather than a binary situation, my opinion is that political debates about the delivery of services gets a lot easier and we focus on providing solutions rather than zero sum arguments which no one can ever win.</description></item><item><title>My Unreasonable Optimism and Why John Dickerson&amp;#8217;s (@jdickerson) Series Should Matter</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-10-06-my-unreasonable-optimism-and-why-john-dickersons-jdickerson-series-should-matter/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-10-06-my-unreasonable-optimism-and-why-john-dickersons-jdickerson-series-should-matter/</guid><description>My Dad and I have this ongoing debate about campaigns. It has been ongoing for four years that I can remember but perhaps longer. It revolves around the forthrightness of campaigns to speak to the electorate logically, with courage, and while keeping within the bounds of logic and reasonableness. Instead of what I desperately want campaigns to do they do the opposite, spiraling into ever more irrelevant crap. Gaffes and ah ha’s are fun and interesting political theater but that is all it is. Theater. Theater is a farce. And we must stop hiring representatives to govern us based on a farcical audition system. This I have felt deeply for a long time. It colors most of my political worldview, rightly or wrongly.</description></item><item><title>On Marines and Krulak&amp;#8217;s Three Blocks</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-09-18-on-marines-and-krulaks-three-blocks/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Sep 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-09-18-on-marines-and-krulaks-three-blocks/</guid><description>Someone emailed me tonight asking what I thought about the attack on the consulate in Benghazi. Being that I was a Marine officer once upon a moon, this person asked whether my blood was up about them passing away and what I thought about the President putting our people in danger like that. Their words. Yes, of course my blood was up. I felt deeply for their families and for the poor souls who had to notice their families and for the entire situation.</description></item><item><title>Compromise &amp;amp; Governing: On Reading @ryanlizza&amp;#8217;s The Obama Memos</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-01-27-compromise-and-governing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-01-27-compromise-and-governing/</guid><description>Ryan Lizza has again written a marvelous piece on Obama and his team. Just as he did with his watershed piece on the Obama campaign, he has written a long and worthwhile piece on Obama's first term to date. If you want to understand the fundamental contradictions that come with governing, and if you want to learn what you elect a President to truly do, read it - after you read my thoughts.</description></item><item><title>The Preacher is Back.

Let me take a look at the Free Market system and rules. Many have argued that rules are inherrently anti-market. That the opposite of capitalism is rule-making by regulators. Maybe that is right in some areas, but I would argue that it depends on the specific area in mind.</description></item><item><title>Leaked Wikis, #Cablegate, and Little Else</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-12-02-leaked-wikis-cablegate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-12-02-leaked-wikis-cablegate/</guid><description>There has been tons of interesting commentary and analysis surrounding cablegate.

informative and balanced pieces on Iraq I’ve read in AGES.  Not sure of its accuracy, but it certainly isn’t too glowing about either party.  I think this is the level of public debate that needs to really be entered into as I detest the black and white stay or leave debate which really gets no one anywhere.  Some of the musings of politicos lately have been whether the American people are able to hear complexity out of their politicians.  Most times I scream yes, but after a trip to Waffle House I think maybe not.</description></item><item><title>Put this one in your

&amp;lsquo;friending&amp;rsquo; on MySpace a bunch of organizations that do good work.  I guess on one level it warms the heart of the friender, knowing that they are on the in with these organizations.  I guess it can also bolster the &amp;lsquo;rolls&amp;rsquo; of the friendee, something that poli_sci has consistently told me is key to grassroots organizing as the bigger the rolls the more money they can potentially raise by leveraging that list to similar organizations that need to get a hold of similar people or from foundations who use the rolls as a proxy for the amount of good the organization will be able to accomplish (similar to a business plan for a small-business loan the grant writing proposal (apparently) can swing for or against often times based upon the size of the roll like the amount of the small-business owner’s money that is already invested in the business).</description></item><item><title>Cultural

there are korean and japanese &amp;lsquo;versions&amp;rsquo; of social networking that blow my space’s flat categories and horrible layouts away.  these asain sites are apparently [sic] with 3d anime that is user controlled where people build living spaces and avatars and interact in much more social ways.  myspace is flat, not very interactive, and very western….identifying yourself by your likes in certain predefined categories and then being able to &amp;lsquo;hook up&amp;rsquo; with those of the same preferences.  despite john cusak’s rant in high fidelity, it is a fairly arbitrary way to build and maintain relationships.  that aside it is a good thing if myspace can creap into the chinese market for many reasons.  any additional means of communication that chinese web users have is another way for the rest of the world to get access to the real attrocities that are going on there, if there are any.  and i’m sure there are.  i’m writing an entire paper that is, essentially, railing on the traditional way that law regulates things, how that is not exactly analogizeable to the internet, and how a different approach would work much better for the us companies, for human rights advocates, and for web users in internet suppressing countries.  congress has been extremely myopic in its one publicly contemplated response to the collusion with china by google, yahoo and microsoft.  i intend to show how a different approach, less rooted in traditional legality, would have much better results legally as well as policy-ly.  it will be out after christmas.  now back to writing.</description></item><item><title>to plant a tree</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-11-08-to-plant-a-tree/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2006 00:00:00
