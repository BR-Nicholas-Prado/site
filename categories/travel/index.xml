We are smack in the middle of a heck of a travelling ten days. Left Chattanooga where we had Christmas for Glasgow where we had New Years via Atlanta (shuttle), London (plane), and Edinburgh (rental car). Then down to L’s farm in Southwest corner of Scotland. Then up to Edinburgh for a nap then to Den Haag via Amsterdam (plane and train). Thursday I trek down to Hargeisa via Zurich, Dubai, and Berbera.</description></item><item><title>On Travelling: I&amp;#8217;m Fed Up Because it&amp;#8217;s all the Same.</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2011-01-22-travelling-fed-same/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2011-01-22-travelling-fed-same/</guid><description>She looked at my passport and flipped, and flipped, and flipped, and flipped. “Wow, you’ve been to a lot of places,” she said with fully disclosed jealousy. Which at first I thought was odd. Four years ago her accent alone would have seemed exotic, enticing, other. Now she appeared to be just another worker trying to get by. I glanced up from my Twitter scanning on my mobile and said without a pause the above reflection may suggest, “yeah, I’ve been to lots of the world’s shit holes.</description></item><item><title>So, It&amp;#8217;s True What They Say&amp;#8230;</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2008-05-29-so-its-true-what-they-say/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2008-05-29-so-its-true-what-they-say/</guid><description>about Russians. For one they are drunks. For another they seem to love leaving their country to hang out in the bush and do wild stuff, like fly planes drunk. I was talking to our interpreter the other day about the people who fly in the qat from Ethiopia. They bring them in on small planes, not necessarily because it is illegal, just because that is the infrastructure arrangement. They also bring them in from the Southern part of S and have to use the planes presumably to avoid the anti-aircraft guns that the TFG and or the UIC may or may not possess.</description></item><item><title>photo-licious</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-09-20-photo-licious/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-09-20-photo-licious/</guid><description>so I finally have up the photos from Georgia and Azerbaijan. It took me a while as I didn’t think that I had the photos, last night in the nether regions of my bag I found the camera card on which the pictures were resting. The pictures include, possibly, the best picture I’ve ever taken. At least it is my favorite picture that I’ve ever taken…

tonight i watched a rockumentary called the last waltz. it made me crave my former life more than i normally do. shit. whatever, tomorrow i return to the land of dockers.
the best part of the weekend, however, was when a friend of mine turned to me at happy hour and laid the best compliment i’ve received in years on me.</description></item></channel></rss>
