&lt;p>We are smack in the middle of a heck of a travelling ten days. Left Chattanooga where we had Christmas for Glasgow where we had New Years via Atlanta (shuttle), London (plane), and Edinburgh (rental car). Then down to L’s farm in Southwest corner of Scotland. Then up to Edinburgh for a nap then to Den Haag via Amsterdam (plane and train). Thursday I trek down to Hargeisa via Zurich, Dubai, and Berbera.&lt;br>
Since I only have a very limited time here in the Hague before I return to Hargeisa, today I had to go get my haircut. I had been in the states for a few months and L wasn’t sure about the state of my hair upon arriving for the Christmas celebrations. The current outlook was grim at any rate. I had purposely delayed getting it cut (and my beard closely trimmed) because I am sometimes incredibly neglgent at life but also because I quite like my Turkish barber here in the Hague.&lt;br>
One thing I am learning about myself is how important patronage is. When I view it through the lens of community formation, patronage becomes exceedingly important to me. The word patron is a funny word. Reconciling medieval notions of artists who had patrons with more modern exclamatories of “don’t patronize me” leaves quite an imterpretive swath. Yet, the patronage I mean I to give someone your business more or less on a regular basis. Sometimes it is an exclusive arrangement; sometimes not. In others words I mean it in the same sense as to become a regular.&lt;br>
Some of the difficulties of living a nomad’s life are eased by assembling small pockets of communities where you are known. But communities, are living things and thereby require engagement in order to survive and to thrive. If you don’t participate in and engage with your communities the linkages between you and them whither. Sometimes it takes an extraordinarily long time for the connections to whither – as I found upon a trip to visit old, grand friends in September after too long apart. Sometimes it doesn’t take long at all for connections to whither – as I found out upon numerous trips to the same Panera where they never once gave me a singular look of recognition.&lt;br>
When the barber was almost ready for me, one of his partners walked in and asked me into his chair. I politely refused the earliest available barber for my guy. My guy speals not a lick of English and I not a lick of Dutch. So we have said very little to one another besides yes / no and some serious sign language. And yet, I feel (perhaps it is one sided) that we have a connection. When I saw me walk in there was a look of recognition on his face. Perhaps he’s just a good actor, but either way it made me feel quite happy to be a known commodity instead of an unknown commodity briefly flitting into and out of existence.&lt;br>
When I first sat in his chair on our first meeting, he looked at my hair for a second, realized I didn’t speak Dutch and then just  grabbed some of my hair indicated a length, I said no, he went shorter, I said yes. That was it until the end when I smiled and rubbed my chin. He used his finger and thumb to indicate short, medium, or long. I said medium with my fingers. Then I gave him the money and went on my way happier for the nice relax and small nap I had gotten while at the barber. Many like to go to their barbers for the news and gossip. I like to go to close my eyes and have a bit of relax. To turn my brain off for a split second. After that first cut, when L saw it, she said it was the best cut I had received in ages. This sealed the deal. So now I am his customer.&lt;br>
I have been a few times since that first time and every time I enjoy the ridiculous Turkish sappy pop songs and the fifties traditional decorating scheme with its marble and glass shelves and perfume bottles and potted plants and overall uptown Manhattan feel circa 1950. But also I get a really great haircut. So now I am willing to get a bit feral in order to wait till I can get back to the Hague to see my barber.&lt;br>
This is a pretty normal way of living ones life it seems to me. Most people I know have a favorite haircutter. It is a funny profession in that way. So universal. It should be known as the fourth or fifth oldest profession. Every community on earth has a barber shop and for a vast majority of the communities the barber shop is a hub of the community. A gathering point for gossip and discussion. A place which did not require the time or effort that a pub required. A place which you never know who you would run into. I like that even if I cannot gossip about who recently married whom at my barber shop, that I can at least walk in and he knows what to do.&lt;br>

&lt;p>She looked at my passport and flipped, and flipped, and flipped, and flipped. “Wow, you’ve been to a lot of places,” she said with fully disclosed jealousy.  Which at first I thought was odd.  Four years ago her accent alone would have seemed exotic, enticing, other.  Now she appeared to be just another worker trying to get by.  I glanced up from my Twitter scanning on my mobile and said without a pause the above reflection may suggest, “yeah, I’ve been to lots of the world’s shit holes.”   She laughed, and I felt sheepish at the arrogance which the comment may have implied.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>OK, I know where all the smoking bars are in Schipol.  I’m no longer surprised by the ridiculous, inefficient Heathrow monstrosity.  I’ve seen the super-efficient Germans’ achievements in process engineering at their militant, rule-loving best (that is, airports).  And don’t get me onto the shit holes where you step out of the secure area (if it exists) into a accosting of a wave of heat, humidity and noise – so much clammer and “taxi.”  I cannot tell you my mobile number at any given moment, but I can tell you my passport number, its issue date and its expiration date.  Along with my social security number and my best friend Joe’s parent’s home phone number these are the only strings of digits I seem to care to recall these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I packed my bags this time to return “home” to Somaliland I sighed and realized consciously, for the first time and perhaps temporarily, that I am dead fed up with traveling.  It isn’t so much the hassle of it all.  Even flying to Somalia is more or less straight-forward these days.  Carrying briefcases around airports isn’t vastly different than carrying them to the office.  I didn’t really turn the why over in m y mind too much as I was a bit hurried getting out the door.  The answer, now that I have had a bit of time, or at least part of the answer may be found here:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I walked down the stairs not really paying much attention.  I like to walk around airports with my headphones noise-canceling and L O U D to hear only the soundtrack to the assorted visions of ridiculosity that are most airports.  My personal montage bereft of gate change announcements and banal banter.  PSYCOLGIE – it screamed from its red perch on a glossy white background.  A magazine on psychology given prime placement is an oddity wherever you go.  ”Maybe I should get that for Brian (aka @worldliness).”  ”What the hell would he want with that?”  ”Maybe he’d like it since he is into psychology and it is from elsewhere.”   “But he can’t read it. What’s he going to do with it – hang it on the wall?” “True” I conceded to my sarcastic self while striding along past, another in the varied imagery of the montage.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Here’s the rub: foreign crap is still crap.  Somehow, and I blame the subjects of Mad Men’s brilliant meanderings, we all have mostly had this fascination with travel.  The glamor, the otherness, the newness to it all.  But everywhere I go, I find people that are more or less the same as many of those I’ve known back home or in other places I’ve lived.  Indeed, I have increasingly come to the conclusion that any group of 5-10k people will have (within obvious allowances) about the same mixture of personality types and if transferred to an entirely new environment and given an entirely new set of problems and collective history – the groups would more or less act in the same manner (again, within allowances).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which reminds me of a Scooby Doo episode which somehow always terrified me as a youngster where the gang awoke in a place that looked exactly like the place they went to sleep in, except it was haunted!  Zoiks.  Therein was my introduction to parallel universe theory.  Indeed, for most of us we want the same things.  A family, friends, and a community we like, love and respect. Good health. Stable lifestyle. The illusion that things will be “better” for our kids (although I’m skeptical of the latter, and wonder often what “better” really constitutes).  We want to laugh, to each, to hug a partner, to do our thing – whatever that may be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is nothing particularly exotic about any place I’ve been. There may be beautiful vistas but those I’ve seen in any country I’ve been to, and some of the best are back home (but, of course, I’m biased). There may be beautiful people – but there are always ugle people too. At the end of the day, it boils down to this: &lt;em>see id.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Does the dystopic flattening of the world into a melancholy riff on the khackiness mean that I’m done?  That I’m off the crazy train I’ve been on since I left home at 18 to my first new place and new environment where I knew no souls? Doubtful. I still love to see new vistas – wherever they may be. I’m still seeking good food, good wine, laughter, romance, and the elusive new experiences. But I’m trying to settle the part of me that feels I’m missing something. The part telling me if I don’t do more, go more, be more that I won’t have enough stories to tell my grand kids. Live in the here and now. Be present – wherever you are. This is what I’m trying to remind myself of these days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was talking to our interpreter the other day about the people who fly in the qat from Ethiopia.  They bring them in on small planes, not necessarily because it is illegal, just because that is the infrastructure arrangement.  They also bring them in from the Southern part of S and have to use the planes presumably to avoid the anti-aircraft guns that the TFG and or the UIC may or may not possess.  But most of these planes are flown by former Soviet Union Air Force pilots. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stereotype was first formed through movies and books of the rogue Russian pilots who will do anything with their planes.  Here it takes it to a new extreme.  They will pack people into planes so tightly that some will have to stand through entire flights.  They will leave the cockpit to come to the back and dig out seats from the cargo hold of the plane and start reassembling the plane while there are passengers sitting in the compartment.  Because, you know on the last flight they had a load of sheep and had to take out the seats.  They will fly their little planes so drunk that they will miss the runway, land somewhere near it and just walk away from their planes and leave them wherever they landed. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have heard all of these stories and have seen glimpses of the stereotypes throughout some of my journeys.  Last night, however, I had my first eye-to-eye experience.  I was in my room and it was a pleasant evening outside.  So I was standing at the window with the screen open enjoying the cool air after a nice thunderstorm.  There are big curtains in my room and they were behind me so I couldn't really see what was happening. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I was peacefully enjoying the cool air and quiet I heard the seat of my toilet fall.  Since it was breezy I didn't think anything of it.  Then I heard another bang but didn't think anything of that either.  A few seconds after the noises I see something move out of the corner of my eye.  I was pretty startled and turned around to see a man pulling the blanket back on my bed and sitting down on it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first I was startled, then I was confused.  Was this some sort of a new turn down service that the hotel had instituted?  Did the staff not know I was here (as I was hidden in the curtains) and come in for a quick snooze?  I said, &amp;ldquo;excuse me….&amp;rdquo; and came out from behind the curtains. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The human sitting on my bed looked up drearily and it was a white guy and so wasn't the staff.  I smelled him before I could make out his face, the stench of his boozing preceded him. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I told the man that he was in the room.  He had his shirt off showing off a massive barrel chest with rock hard stomach (and I don't mean abs….&lt;a href="http://www.benderball.com/">I love my abdominals….I love my belly….I love my abdominals&lt;/a>…this guy loved his food and booze).  He also was barefooted, had a head as big as a lion's, and of course he was wearing blue warm up pants.  AND SITTING ON MY BED.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We began to argue a bit about why he was there.  He got pretty belligerent with me for a bit and then got quite apologetic.  He started to pace around my room and ask me what I had done with his stuff.  I replied that this was my stuff and that he was in my room.  The door to the suite was open and the door to the suite across the hall was open.  I glanced out in the hall and back at him quickly (to make sure that the f-er wasn't going to appropriate any of my stuff) and there was about 18 room service trays in there with tin foil and bowls and cups everywhere.  His TV was on at about 84 trillion decibels. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>During one of his apologetic swings I asked him what his room number was.  He said the room number on the door across the hall, but I could not make him comprehend that the room he was sitting in was not the room that he was given.  During one of his acrimonious swings he told me that he was a great customer here and that this was going to be his room.  I began to think that he wanted to trade rooms rather than just being drunken and disoriented.  During one of his apologetic swings he called down to the front desk, but either it was busy or he hung up on them.  During one of his acrimonious swings he told me that he was a captain and that I should respect him. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought, you're a bit old to be a captain.  I also thought, I'm a Captain too Mother F, now get the hell out of my room.  But despite my belligerent tendencies I belayed my sarcasm.  If you wonder why, *see supra.  *Although he was drunk, he probably had fought a time or two in his life while drunk and, HE WAS HUGE. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So after ten minutes of me telling him to get out of my room and him telling me to get out of his room and him swinging back and forth between sorry and angry and me thinking about the nice calm cool air outside and him not able to talk English very well and me not able to talk Russian at all, I called down to the front desk and asked them to send someone up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nice dudes from downstairs came right up and he listened to them.  After he got out of my room I locked the door.  It had not been locked before, because I was awake and was just relaxing.  So now I keep it lock, to keep the drunken Russian Bush Pilots out.  That's one of the stereotypes about Africa that I'm happy to leave in the realm of popular culture.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>urs and i made a weekend trip to liberia.  other highlights which you will have to ask me about over a drink: missing the helicopter and taking a speed boat at mach two in 5 foot seas at oblique angles to the trajectory of the boat in order for 25 minutes in order to make our plane.  almost being forced into an impromptu inspection of a liberian immigration detention facility. food and beverage smuggling. &lt;a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;amp;click_id=68&amp;amp;art_id=nw20070604113522453C836170">avoiding taking&lt;/a> the helicopter which crashed and killed 22 other people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but that is not all i have to say about that.  there were a lot of differences for only a forty minute flight.  one definite difference is that the people there are colder.  i told urs that i felt like the smiles didn’t come as easy as they do to SLeans but when they came they were bigger.  they are a bigger people, overall, that the SLeans for sure.  and maybe due to the proximity of the war, but they feel overall more militant. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it was weird there the dynamics between the whites and the blacks that i observed.  overall it seemed that the whites were almost subservient to the blacks.  it wasn’t exactly a power dynamic realignment, it was more like business humans schmoozing with government and in this case it was amplified b/c the business people were white and the ministers, etc. were black.  but it was odd to see, and good to see that almost everywhere we went blacks were a majority.  you may think, well, duh, you’re in africa.  but in SL it is not like that.  most every place where the expats go they go in droves and there will be very few black people there.  it is hideous and annoys me to no end, and i try to avoid it but sometimes the avoiding is harder than the capitulating.  i have rarely seen a SL minister or high-ranking official, even in the nice places.  and in only a few minutes in the mamba point hotel in monrovia i saw two ministers and two senators and a few congressmen.  so had i stayed longer and not left for drinks at the marine house on the us embassy compound where a friend of mine had been ten years before during some massive unrest, i’m sure i would have seen more.  we saw charles taylor’s wife at the grocery store.  i have never seen anyone of import in SL.  never.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but the white people there seemed odd to me.  more hardened than here. less save the world types and more…different.  i was trying for some time to put my finger on what it was and i still cannot.  i think that the white people there also have a hard life and many of them do not have the freedom that we have here in SL to mingle.  also you saw a lot more old people there. not the white people so much but dignified african gentlemen and ladies.  it was good to see how elegant they looked, but it was also good to see that either they have eradicated a lot of diseases or their healthcare system is marginally better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the city itself is slightly more developed in my opinion than freetown.  the power is about the same, but the water situation is better (it is easier b/c of the lack of hills) and the transportation infrastructure is miles ahead.  construction infrastructure and construction itself is vastly more improved than here in freetown where they are still constructing with manpower and wheelbarrows, there they had he3avy machinery and a certain taste in architecture which you will not find elsewhere.  also the port is a freeport and is operational, there is an industrial sector which is about ready to come back online and the sanctions on their diamonds have just been lifted and on other products it is about to be lifted.  so they are well-established to make leaps and bounds of improvements if they continue their current trend.   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the last tanglible difference was how much more urban it felt.  there was one beach bar in monrovia, but only one.  here there are many.  freetown in comparison is more like a laid-back beach community and monrovia was more like a city that is going places and has things to do.  the streets were wide but moveable.  the clubs were not open air but where inside and the music was less african and more american/european.  monrovia had more sectors or more planned urban design than freetown. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>so that is my review of the difference there were others that we realized, but those are the main ones worthy of note.  now i must work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i leave on thursday night to go to amsterdam and then down to the hague.  i should arrive in the hague friday afternoon.  i’ll be there through the summer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>~ # ~&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, well there is lots to say.  Many of the stories from the trip are embedded in the pictures in the album.  I will give the highlights of each day here if you are really interested…Will flush out a couple of the themes in here through the next week!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 1: Arrive, harassed at airport as per norm, put foot down with harassor, cab ride to hotel, drinks at posh lounges.  Approached by many beautiful women who spoke no English.  Not interested in engaging in the services of the oldest profession.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 2: Get up to nice breakfast of Patisseries and COFFEE that wasn’t instant.  Wonderful eggs, a bit of great cheese. Head off for the markets, heartily disappointed, almost pickpocketed.  Find a quiet Chocolaterrie, drink a Yogurt milkshake thing. Happy. Walk to an art gallery. Finally find African art worth more than a one second glance. Stare at a beautiful exhibit of faces of West African artists, poets, sculptors, etc. Find a pub have a beer. Back to the hotel for siesta. Watch sunset over Daakar on our terrace eating good cheese on proper baguette and drinking Senegalese wine.  All of this sentence is highly recommended save for the word Senegalese…take that word out of the sentence and the scene would have been close to perfect.  Dress for Thai garden.  Eat to a chant of frogs. Find jazz at Just for You (first of three nights out of four in Daakar to be here). Listen to Orchestra Boubab. Realize that I’ve found the jazz place I’ve searched for my entire life. Beyond happy. Rhum. Dancing under some tree on the beach surrounded by people who speak no English save for my friends. Bed at about 6.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 3: Arise (finally). Eat. Go to Isle de Goree. Amazed by the craziest, hippest, most wonderful artistic community I’ve ever seen. Run out of money but promise to return to buy art. Eat at a romantic place with Brett as my date and Urs and Rosio as our double date. Wish highlands was there with me. Return to the mainland, return to Just for You. Listen to a crazy Senegalese version of Billy Holiday/Nina Simone. Realizations of Day 2 re: this place are fully confirmed. Bed at a reasonable 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 4: Arise. Hassled/Haggle. Four hour long-distance cabbie drives us to Saint-Louis in the northeast corner of Senegal. Check into hotel where Frenchy airmail pilots stayed a long time ago.  Eat amazing lobster ravioli in a pink sauce. Find good live music in a random courtyard where someone was selling beers. Turns out they were Gunean and not Senegalese, I didn’t hold it against them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 5: Walk around the island. Take tons of pictures. Siesta by the pool. Read. Eat a marginal dinner. Find average live music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 6: Walk over the bridge to the fishing village side of the river. Take lots of pictures of kids. The crazy thing was how excited and happy and non-hassly they were. Once you took their picture they only wanted to see themselves. I was happy to oblige. Walked through the markets smelled wonderful treats such as skinned goats hanging in the heat surrounded by flies. Ate Boubab root. Not awful. Walked to Mauritania. Walked back to Senegal. Took a horse-cart to Mauritania. Felt like Jesus as I entered Boiyo. Then I was harassed by the border guards. Wondered if I would get my passport back without bribing anyone…didn’t, but I did get my passport back. Horse-cart back to Senegal. Watch boring soccer game. Eat something memorable, except cannot quite remember right now. Hear this crazy acapella guy who would create soundscapes by looping sounds that he had made and layering each on top of the other.  He was crazy. And magnificent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 7: Walk over to the mainland side of the river. Very middle Class over there. Take a Senegalese Poda-Poda. Crazy. Eat african food. Almost get taken for a ride by a taxicab driver until he screws up. Buy antique Mauritanian daggers without considering whether I’ll be able to transport them across international borders. Meet African German teacher who is in love with one of his students.  Walk back as the sun sets. Do some yoga. Eat. Drink. Relax. Read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 8: Drive back to Daakar. Settle in. Eat. Drink. Back to Just for You. Cheik Lo is playing. We stay. This guy was the most truly beat guy I’ve ever met. Crazy! All above is confirmed. Meet insane traditional Senegalese dancers and their choreographer. Go to Via Roma to hang with them. Music is beyond loud, all the Senegalese are dancing their dances. Us white people were sitting there.  To bed at 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 9: Brett woke me up by moving his bed around on the linoleum floor to find his shorts at about 10. Hungover but not too badly. Breakfast alone. Meet up with others after wandering around lost looking for their posh hotel pool to meet them. Finally find them. Place is crazy. Surrounded by white people. Felt weird. Left after a dip to Isle de Goree. Two main artists remember and were pleased at my return. Buy MUCH artwork. Fantasize about becoming a Senegalese importer of art as I watch the sunset from the hill on the island while sitting with a bunch of rastas and not talking for an hour or something. Back to Daakar. Dinner at crazy African place, realize Sierra Leonean food isn’t so bad in comparison to traditional Senegalese food. Back to lounge bars for a quiet night. End up in bed at 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 10: Up at 6:30. HUNGOVER. Don’t really remember the cab ride, or checking in. Start coming to on the plane. End up in Sierra Leone. My friends took the ferry (slow), I took the helicopter as I needed a bit of space from them. Come off the helicopter with bags in hand, satisfied with my adventures. Struck that SL sort of felt like home.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>in order to explain it properly a little backstory is in order.  i case i haven’t laid it out for you, i have two basic roads diverged&lt;br>
inside my yellow self.  the first is to &amp;ldquo;go to work&amp;rdquo; and just sell to&lt;br>
the litigation man and move to NY, live fast, live hard, learn to&lt;br>
litigate like a champ.  the other road is to &amp;ldquo;have a good life&amp;rdquo; and go&lt;br>
to a medium market and not work so hard, or be so good, but also have a&lt;br>
life outside of my 2 AM chinese feasts, my blackberry and my $5000&lt;br>
suits.  the only markets that i’m really considering are: portland,&lt;br>
austin and denver.  in that order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ok.  i just accepted my second job for the summer.  this one with a state appeals court in texas.  this is good for a number of reasons.  first of all it will be in austin.  austin is one of my cities.  that is good.  this will be a great recommendation and will (i think) virtually ensure that i can get an interview there for a 2L job.  in fact, i will probably interview with firms while i’m there to get it out of the way.  also i would want to interview there as the firms that are there are outposts of big law firms headquartered in houston or dallas.  the attorneys that those firms will send to on-campus interview season next fall will be from the larger offices in the bigger cities.  that means that they may not have a clue about life in the austin office.  they may, but more likely they will tell me that they know and they won’t really know.  so it will be advantageous to go check it out.  in addition to the austin connection and the judge being a great reference to lawyers in that city, judge law (yes that’s his name) will be a good reference in general.  state appeals courts, although not as prestigious as state supreme courts, may give me more exposure b/c of their higher work load.  plus i’ll be in the same building as the state supreme court so i can talk to those people.  since it is of lesser prestige that means i’ll be doing more of the work.  the administrative assistant has already told me that i will be researching and writing opinions.  me, the freak 1L, will be writing opinions that could be in textbooks some day.  pretty kool huh?  on a state supreme court level i won’t be doing the writing, only the reasearch.  then there is the layer of the federal court system.  1L’s DON’T GET JOBS at the federal appeals court level.  it doesn’t happen unless you are #1 at harvard and have 5 degrees prior to being a JD candidate.  so that leaves the federal trial court level, now that would be interesting.  the difference between trial courts and appeals courts is that appeals courts are clean.  i don’t have any problem getting my fingers dirty, however at the appeals level you get to focus on what the law is.  much of the emotion is taken out of it.  much of the gamesmanship is taken out of it.  much of the uncertainty of juries is taken out of it.  that leaves time and space for the law to really come full force and be analyzed in detail.  so all in all i think that i will be the best experience possible for me.  and i’m not just trying to justify not getting an offer from the TN or TX supreme courts.  i did have offers from the fed trial level, but i don’t think that the prestige of federal over state courts outweighs the prestige and possibilities for learning of appeals over trial courts.  so it will be a good reference, it will be prestigious, &amp;amp; it will be a great learning experience.  enough said.  wait there is more.  it is in AUSTIN.  which should be GREAT over the summer, bands, booze, etc.  now i just have to convince cam to come with me!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the other half will be in aspen at the policy and litigation firm out there.  i am excited about that one too as i will see life from the other side.  we’re to work on a national security policy position paper.  we’re to work on some big-time environmental litigation and some other litigation as well.  it will be a rounded experience. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>then there is faith’s non-profit which i think that i’m going to start working with her on.  at least i can do the IRS filing for her non-profit status.  that isn’t a small deal either.  i can also do some liasoning with the young lawyers committee of the miami bar association and to help her develop her curiculum for these kids.  so i will also be working on that over the summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then there is the book that is starting to coallesce inside my head and that must be written this summer, at least in a solid draft form.  it will be good and it will get done.  i cannot wait.  this summer is going to be what i want out of it.  varied, interesting, polarizing, emasculatizing, and generally all-tizing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>tonight i watched a rockumentary called the last waltz.  it made me crave my former life more than i normally do.  shit.  whatever, tomorrow i return to the land of dockers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the best part of the weekend, however, was when a friend of mine turned to me at happy hour and laid the best compliment i’ve received in years on me.  &amp;ldquo;you know man from now on i’m going to call you: THE DUDE.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;pour me another caucasian gary.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
