I agree with everything this dude writes. Especially the following line:

They’ve developed an entire culture based on wanting me to punch them in the face.

it was more violent than the first, and there was less of johnny depp’s witticisms. the special effects were tremendous, the costume/set designers should both be oscar contenders. the plot line was much more linear than the first movie. there was also a different narrative arc that is the archetype for these movies, the tension was frontloaded and then like a good mile runner they just tried to ride out the momentum until the end.</description></item><item><title>working on a feeling</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2006-06-07-working-on-a-feeling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2006-06-07-working-on-a-feeling/</guid><description>[![740759036_l_1][2]][2] tonight i saw this movie. you should too. it contains a decent soundtrack and one of my favorite vehicles for a narrative framework: the roadtrip. some of the scenes in it were so spot on i didn’t know what to do. i lapsed in to an analysis of the femine/masculine perspectives on life but was torn out of it when i realized that all the women around me were laughing at the things happening just as often as i was.</description></item><item><title>cities</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-11-22-cities/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-11-22-cities/</guid><description>tiny cities ARE made of ashes.
