I<br>think that it is mostly to my &ldquo;advantage,&rdquo; although there are a few<br>&ldquo;disadvantages.&rdquo;</p><p>My view of much of my class is fairly close to what I expected:  greek,<br>business or poli sci majors, straight from college, clicky, etc.  In<br>the two weeks we’ve been together now I have watched the stratification<br>of this formerly nebulous mixture o people into their respective<br>pieces, or more appropriately how they have viewed themselves<br>throughout their undergraduate experience.  This is a carryover for<br>these people, a mere continuation.  I can tell it by the way they talk<br>about drinking by the away messages they leave on their AIM accounts by<br>the ease which they flow around the building with their computer bags<br>yanking at their trapezious muscles. </p><p>There are a few exceptions to the rules, those that are not greek,<br>those with interesting majore, those that took the vaunted one year<br>off, but by and large these exceptions are only in one category and<br>those that exhibit these exceptions fall into line on the other<br>categories. </p><p>There are a few others.  I know of two with masters (one that has his<br>MFA in creative writing and with whom I have had many chats), and one<br>other guy who is older than me.  He is married with a couple of kids,<br>etc. </p><p>Then there is me.  I’m not yet sure how I fit into the social spectrum,<br>cream or juice?  I, frankly, do not care.  I’m equally nice and equally<br>ass-holic to most people which stems from the fact that I feel that I<br>have much less vested in the social aspect of this school scenario.<br>I’ve been in the real world, I know what it is like to spend entire<br>months only talking to one or two people, none of that ever bothered<br>me.  But many of these people do not know that freedom and so they tie<br>much of their identity up in the social dynamics.</p><p>This vestiture creates some interesting things.  Firstly, I think it<br>creates in many a fear of &ldquo;being called on&rdquo; by the professors.  In the<br>socratic method professors will pick out a student and then stick with<br>them for a while asking question after question, hopefully breaking off<br>the outside skin of the onion and distilling the truth out of the<br>specificity of the case…..specificity to generality is the law school<br>mantra (mixing of metaphors was on purpose).  But this method is<br>generally frightening to many people b/c their brainpower will be laid<br>out there for all their social comrades to see if they’re an idiot or<br>surprisingly mentally adroit.  Secondly, I think it creates a dynamic<br>similar to high school.  We are around the same people, in the same<br>building, all the time.  What I mean by the high school simile (which<br>is far from unique) is merely the constancy of display.  You can’t blow<br>up at someone without the rest of the class finding out about it<br>quickly and then they will all look at you, look at you in class, look<br>at you in the halls on the way to the lockers, look at you in the cafe<br>during lunch, look at you in the library after class when much of our<br>compatriots are in the same large room with big tables that always<br>makes me think that I’m in the study hall from Dead Poet’s Society and<br>that cranky teacher is going to come in at any moment and make me turn<br>off my iPod and study harder.</p><p>So the rest of them are very vested.  I’m not.  I don’t give a flying<br>rat fuck about any of that stuff.  I’m here to spend $60k a year to<br>learn stuff, and I’ll learn it well.</p><p>The life experience aspect of it all is the other advantage that I<br>hold, the only one that really matters (I think) besides the &ldquo;not<br>caring about what people think of me&rdquo; advantage.  In classes where you<br>are nearly required to have a perspective on the world and you can only<br>conceptually create one it builds an idealist when a realist would do.<br>These are all advantages and I won’t belabor the point, even though it<br>is a valid one.  I understand business in a way they don’t.  I<br>understand politics in a way they don’t.  I understand foreign<br>relations, and constitutional powers and the mind of evil people in a<br>way they don’t.  But none of that matters now.  Right now we’ve all<br>been thrown blindfolded, tied up, and dowsed in K-Y into the pool and<br>are merely trying to get our bearings without the lube making our eyes<br>sting.  We’ll just have to see how this all pans out.</p><p>The main disadvantage is the being used to the school deal and the<br>knowing how to study deals…..</p></blockquote><p>Happy Birthday to me.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/16033dfb5f6cfc36e05b1b6f2afcb2943819f692 target=_blank rel=noopener>16033df</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
