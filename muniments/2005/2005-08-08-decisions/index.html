factor diminishes exponentially with your radius from dixie.  it isn’t exactly harvard, nor is it florida state university. </p><blockquote><p><em>you know what kind of doors it would open for you?</em></p></blockquote><p>yes.  but at what cost in time and debt do i go into this thing &ldquo;merely for options.&rdquo;  i mean $150K in debt is a pretty fucking big gamble that i’m going to have some major employment opportunities waiting for me on the back side.  if i wanted to just keep writing i’d have to have some massive offers waiting on the table to afford a decent lifestyle plus that kind of a &ldquo;mortgage.&rdquo;  if i don’t go and i keep writing, i only have the minimum of debt and will probably be able to live fine on that.</p><blockquote><p><em>you know what kind of ass you would pull at a college campus?</em></p></blockquote><p>yes.  lots.  but is that why i’m going?</p><p>so here i am stressed out of my own mind and then all this stuff is added on top of it.  all my friends and family are asking me constantly what the hell i’m going to be doing in a week.  will it be law school will it be writing.  i know that they all intend well, i know that they were just concerned, but it is overfuckingwhelming on my end of the spectrum.  at least ten emails a day and at least four voicemails a day for the last week all asking the same question.  it would be fuck loads easier if i had an answer to give them.  either way, even if it was the answer that i don’t want to be giving them, right now i’d pick that shit over this ambiguous purgatory where i have to plan for all possibilities.</p><p>so here i am in this house of death, watching both of my grandparents deteriorate before my very eyes.  my aunt is departing in tears, thoroughly convinced that one or both will die before she would have a chance to return.  my mother has put the world on her shoulders as usual is playing the martyr to a T.  and here i am.  detached and calloused to death because of my experiences.  when i’ve seen it so vividly, even those close to me become just another person on the battlefield.  how the HELL is that possible.  this is my mamo.  my grandmother.  why do i feel zero emotional attachtment to what is going on.  i realize that it is a coping mechanism, that i’m so terrified of facing my own mortality on any scale (probably because i don’t feel that my morality house is exactly in order) that i don’t deal with death.  that i just isolate it and do not force myself to face it. </p><p>but that is going to change real fast i have a notion.  we’ll just have to see how it all plays out.</p><p>this is the most depressed i’ve been in a long, long time.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/5fcb7aa062576518427ace5cf4afcb1b6f85686f target=_blank rel=noopener>5fcb7aa</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
