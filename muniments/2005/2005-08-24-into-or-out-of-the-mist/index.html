[in a patronizing voice].  but i’m not sure where that great will be.  i guess that could be a metaphor for my life.  for my desires towards women, for my desires towards fulfillment, for my desires, for my life.</p><p>when did i become so unsure of myself?  i have always had direction, drive, determination, focus, goals and all that zig zigler shit.  and now?  now i cannot even understand what the fuck i’m doing spending $150k on an education that i only want to marginally (at best) use.  i like it, don’t get me wrong.  it is challenging and collegial and academic and all that crap, but is it correct.</p><p>for the first time in over 10 days i actually had some time.  whether i’ve been moving or settling or entering into new social interactions (meeting new people, yaddy yadda) or figuring out the class load or remembering how to study, or whatever.  i’ve been fucking rush rush rush for the past while.  that more so than the fact that i’m here is what is really compromising the value system that i had established for myself over two years of claiming to be an artist.  but what was really lacking was time.  time to think, time to analyze, time to examine, time to be.  i haven’t looked deeply at anything other than what the fuck this dude means when he says &ldquo;stare decisis is crap and i say that stare principiis should reign supreme&rdquo; for whatever that is worth. </p><p>today i finished my work up while at school and came home and worked out and then had some time before eric and i were to run to dinner and i just sat on the couch (laid) and thought and listened to some music and just was.  i had a moment of reconciliation where i realized that this is just like anything else.  it isn’t different, it may be new, but it is the fucking same.  i need to treat it the same.  i need to stop looking at the face value of my experience and remember what i have learned over the course of these past years since i returned from combat.  i have to analyze what the fuck is important in the manner.</p><p>today i realized that i was thinking exactly what the teacher was wanting me to think.  like a fish hooked on the lip being drug to the left and then to the right.  i could fight, but i was still at her mercy.  but it is the one class, the one and only true intellectual endeavor which i will experience this year.  i cannot let myself do that.  i have to think either faster or slower than she wants be to think.  i have to go anti-ocsillitory she keeps us running back and forth back and forth and i need that to end for me.  i need to rage against the machine, at least in that class. </p><p>i expressed these sentiments to a few people in between that class and another and they looked at me like i was courtney love exiting church in a long ann taylor dress.  nevertheless that is how it has to be.  i have to think more, act less, be more efficient.  but more than all of that i just have to be who i am, and not who any of these professors want me to become.  &ldquo;we’re here to teach you to think like a lawyer&rdquo; is OK except for when i don’t want to think like a lawyer.</p><p>but will that be inevitable?  i’m unsure.  what will i be LIKE at the end of this process.  we’ll all have to find that out together.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/5fcb7aa062576518427ace5cf4afcb1b6f85686f target=_blank rel=noopener>5fcb7aa</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
