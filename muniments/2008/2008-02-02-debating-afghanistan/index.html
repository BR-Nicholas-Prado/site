I was reassured that he can be wonkish plus still give me optimism.  For calling myself a progressive, I’ve come around slowly on Barak due to concerns about this issue, but also just because it is difficult to believe. </p><p>For so much of my life politicians have been somethings that really haven’t impacted on my life, and if they have it has not be positive.  I feel disenfranchised from the entire process.  While Big_Head has been in love with political process for a while, I’ve come around slowly.  It has taken this election to engage me.  Now I pray at the alter of John King’s bibliographical mind and crazy hands on that freaking board on CNN that I love. </p><p>But more than that I’ve come around to believe.  To really want someone to win, not just shrug my shoulders, and certainly not shake my head. </p><p>I think that when people get passionate about politics, especially left-wingers, they fail to understand how things really work in Washington.  I think for the most part Barak and Hillary will be able to accomplish very similar things in Washington.  Both will take aggressive stances on progressive issues, and with a Democratic congress will push through some things and will see some other things fail.  Both will do approximately the same thing that McCain will do on Iraq and will likely take very similar foreign policy stances – in reality (no matter what any one says on the trail to pander to their bases).</p><p>So on the one hand the problems and solutions are so complex that there is a limiting  mechanism that kicks in after inauguration.  I am interested when people really debate what a President’s position is on many of these issues, as if the Executive didn’t have to go to Congress.  Most of what is being talked about in the debates, no matter who wins, is going to have to get pushed through Congress.  It is not like if Hillary wins we get universal healthcare the next day.  The President can only do so much on domestic issues.  That aside.  At the end of the day, for me, their relative collapse on the issues cuts towards Obama. </p><p>Sure there is the thing about Hillary and the war, and maybe that will resonate with some people, especially core partisans.  She is getting demolished by the press for the answer she gave about Iraq.  But those people are playing partisan politics via the media.  I thought her answer was straight-forward and honest, it was eloquent, pragmatic and reasoned and I whole heartedly disagree with those people that have been turned off by that answer.  I thought what she said was on point.</p><p>But, that isn’t what I care about.  I care about hope.  And I feel that I’ve found it in Obama.  I’m engaged, and, for once, I’m optimistic.</p><p>There is much more analysis in my head but this should suffice for now.</p><p>After the dem’s debate finished, I kept flipping through my Gazillion channels to find more punditry as John King was cut off too quickly for my likes.  Flipped through CSPAN, and there was a Senate Foreign Relations Hearing about what the HELL are we going to do in Afghanistan.  It was UTTERLY fascinating!!!!  Afghanistan is so messed up right now.  If you want to know about it, read the Foreignpolicy.com article below.</p><p><a href=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/node/8014 title="It seems Europe is determined to lose in Afghanistan | FP Passport">It seems Europe is determined to lose in Afghanistan</a>.</p><p>One of the major problems that I see occurring time and again is the lack of judicial sector reform.  I think that post-conflict transitions are going to soon be in a place where my aggresive ROL reforms that I’ve been formulating in my head will become international best practices.  We need to train police and judges and prosecutors and defense attorneys better after a country &ldquo;cleans up&rdquo; (whatever that means).  For now that is all I’ll say as I’m still formulating most of the theorem. </p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/f8718852f77c053a8320cfc7aac5eec11e008b1d target=_blank rel=noopener>f871885</a> @ 2020-04-09</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
