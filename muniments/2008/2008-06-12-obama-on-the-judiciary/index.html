I think this<br>perspective misreads the American people.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>From traveling throughout Illinois and more recently around the country, I<br>can tell you that Americans are suspicious of labels and suspicious of jargon. <br>They don't think George Bush is mean-spirited or prejudiced, but have become<br>aware that his administration is irresponsible and often incompetent.  They<br>don't think that corporations are inherently evil (a lot of them work in<br>corporations), but they recognize that big business, unchecked, can fix the game<br>to the detriment of working people and small entrepreneurs.  They don't think<br>America is an imperialist brute, but are angry that the case to invade Iraq was<br>exaggerated, are worried that we have unnecessarily alienated existing and<br>potential allies around the world, and are ashamed by events like those at Abu<br>Ghraib which violate our ideals as a country.</p><p>It's this non-ideological lens through which much of the country viewed Judge<br>Roberts&rsquo; confirmation hearings.   A majority of folks, including a number of<br>Democrats and Independents, don't think that John Roberts is an ideologue bent<br>on overturning every vestige of civil rights and civil liberties protections in<br>our possession.  Instead, they have good reason to believe he is a conservative<br>judge who is (like it or not) within the mainstream of American jurisprudence, a<br>judge appointed by a conservative president who could have done much worse (and<br>probably, I fear, may do worse with the next nominee).  While they hope Roberts<br>doesn't swing the court too sharply to the right, a majority of Americans think<br>that the President should probably get the benefit of the doubt on a clearly<br>qualified nominee.</p><p>A plausible argument can be made that too much is at stake here and now, in<br>terms of privacy issues, civil rights, and civil liberties, to give John Roberts<br>the benefit of the doubt.  That certainly was the operating assumption of the<br>advocacy groups involved in the nomination battle. </p><p>I shared enough of these concerns that I voted against Roberts on the floor<br>this morning.  But short of mounting an all-out filibuster — a quixotic fight I<br>would not have supported; a fight I believe Democrats would have lost both in<br>the Senate and in the court of public opinion; a fight that would have been<br>difficult for Democratic senators defending seats in states like North Dakota<br>and Nebraska that are essential for Democrats to hold if we hope to recapture<br>the majority; and a fight that would have effectively signaled an unwillingness<br>on the part of Democrats to confirm any Bush nominee, an unwillingness which I<br>believe would have set a dangerous precedent for future administrations –<br>blocking Roberts was not a realistic option.</p><p>In such circumstances, attacks on Pat Leahy, Russ Feingold and the other<br>Democrats who, after careful consideration, voted for Roberts make no sense. <br>Russ Feingold, the only Democrat to vote not only against war in Iraq but also<br>against the Patriot Act, doesn't become complicit in the erosion of civil<br>liberties simply because he chooses to abide by a deeply held and legitimate<br>view that a President, having won a popular election, is entitled to some<br>benefit of the doubt when it comes to judicial appointments. Like it or not,<br>that view has pretty strong support in the Constitution's design.</p></blockquote></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/5fcb7aa062576518427ace5cf4afcb1b6f85686f target=_blank rel=noopener>5fcb7aa</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
