This is what the creator said about this video.  I’m not an artist, I do other things, but I agree with almost everything he says.</p><blockquote><p>I was sitting in my recording studio watching the debates…<br>Torn between the candidates<br>I was never really big on politics…<br>and actually I’m still not big on politics…<br>but 4 years ago, me and the black eyed peas supported Kerry…<br>And we supported Kerry with all our might…<br>We performed and performed and performed for the DNC…<br>doing all we could do to get the youth involved…</p><p>The outcome of the last 2 elections has saddened me…<br>on how unfair, backwards, upside down, unbalanced, untruthful,<br>corrupt, and just simply, how wrong the world and &ldquo;politics&rdquo; are…</p><p>So this year i wanted to get involved and do all i could early…</p><p>And i found myself torn…<br>because this time it’s not that simple…<br>our choices aren’t as clear as the last elections …<br>last time it was so obvious…<br>Bush and war vs. no bush and no war…</p><p>But this time it’s not that simple…<br>and there are a lot of people that are torn just like i am…<br>So for awhile I put it off and i was going to wait until it was decided for me…</p><p>And then came New Hampshire…<br>And i was captivated…<br>Inspired…</p><p>I reflected on my life…<br>and the blessings I have…<br>and the people who fought for me to have these rights and blessings…</p><p>and I’m not talking about a &ldquo;black thing&rdquo;<br>I’m talking about a &ldquo;human thing&rdquo; me as a &ldquo;person&rdquo;<br>an American…</p><p>That speech made me think of Martin Luther King…<br>Kennedy…<br>and Lincoln…<br>and all the others that have fought for what we have today…</p><p>what America is &ldquo;supposed&rdquo; to be…</p><p>freedom…<br>equality…<br>and truth…</p><p>and thats not what we have today…<br>we think we are free…<br>but in reality terror and fear controls our decisions…</p><p>this is not the America that our pioneers and leaders fought and<br>died for…</p><p>and then there was New Hampshire</p><p>it was that speech…<br>like many great speeches…<br>that one moved me…<br>because words and ideas are powerful…</p><p>It made me think…<br>and realize that today we have &ldquo;very few&rdquo; leaders…<br>maybe none…</p><p>but that speech…</p><p>it inspired me…</p><p>it inspired me to look inside myself and outwards towards the world…<br>it inspired me to want to change myself to better the world…<br>and take a &ldquo;leap&rdquo; towards change…<br>and hope that others become inspired to do the same…<br>change themselves..<br>change their greed…<br>change their fears…<br>and if we &ldquo;change that&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;then hey&rdquo;..<br>we got something right…???…</p><p>1 week later after the speech settled in me…<br>I began making this song…<br>I came up with the idea to turn his speech into a song…<br>because that speech effected and touched my inner core like nothing in a very long time…</p><p>it spoke to me…</p><p>because words and ideas are powerful…</p><p>I just wanted to add a melody to those words…<br>I wanted the inspiration that was bubbling inside me to take over…</p><p>so i let it..</p><p>I wasn’t afraid to stand for something…<br>to stand for &ldquo;change&rdquo;…<br>I wasn’t afraid of &ldquo;fear&rdquo;…<br>it was pure inspiration…</p><p>so I called my friends…<br>and they called their friends…<br>in a matter of 2 days…<br>We made the song and video…</p><p>Usually this process would take months…<br>a bunch of record company people figuring out strategies and release dates…<br>interviews…<br>all that stuff…<br>but this time i took it in my own hands…<br>so i called my friends sarah pantera, mike jurkovac, fred goldring, and jesse dylan to help make it happen…<br>and they called their friends..<br>and we did it together in 48 hours…<br>and instead of putting it in the hands of profit we put it in the hands of inspiration…</p><p>then we put it on the net for the world to feel…</p><p>When you are truly inspired..<br>magic happens…<br>incredible things happen…<br>love happens..<br>(and with that combination)</p><p>&ldquo;love, and inspiration&rdquo;</p><p>change happens…</p><p>&ldquo;change for the better&rdquo;<br>Inspiration breeds change…</p><p>&ldquo;Positive change&rdquo;…</p><p>no one on this planet is truly experienced to handle the obstacles we face today…<br>Terror, fear, lies, agendas, politics, money, all the above…<br>It’s all scary…</p><p>Martin Luther King didn’t have experience to lead…<br>Kennedy didn’t have experience to lead…<br>Susan B. Anthony…<br>Nelson Mandella…<br>Rosa Parks…<br>Gandhi…<br>Anne Frank…<br>and everyone else who has had a hand in molding the freedoms we have and take for granted today…</p><p>no one truly has experience to deal with the world today…</p><p>they just need &ldquo;desire, strength, courage ability, and passion&rdquo; to change…<br>and to stand for something even when people say it’s not possible…</p><p>America would not be here &ldquo;today&rdquo; if we didn’t stand and fight for<br>change &ldquo;yesterday&rdquo;…<br>Everything we have as a &ldquo;people&rdquo; is because of the &ldquo;people&rdquo; who fought for<br>change…<br>and whoever is the President has to realize we have a lot of changing to do</p><p>I’m not trying to convince people to see things how i do…<br>I produced this song to share my new found inspiration and how I’ve been moved…<br>I hope this song will make you feel…<br>love…<br>and think…<br>and be inspired just like the speech inspired me…</p><p>that’s all…</p><p>Let’s all come together like America is supposed to…<br>Like Japan did after Hiroshima…</p><p>that was less than 65 years ago…<br>and look at Japan now…</p><p>they did it together…<br>they did it…</p><p>&ldquo;We can’t?…</p><p>Are you serious..?..</p><p>WE CAN!!!</p><p>Yes we can…<br>A United &ldquo;America&rdquo;<br>Democrats, Republicans and Independents together…<br>Building a new America</p><p>We can do it…<br>&ldquo;TOGETHER&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>This is the original speech which inspired the song, it is art in its own right.</p><p>[]<a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/Fe751kMBwms&rel=1" title="Click here to block this object with Adblock Plus">5</a><a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/Fe751kMBwms&rel=1" title="Click here to block this object with Adblock Plus">5</a></p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/16033dfb5f6cfc36e05b1b6f2afcb2943819f692 target=_blank rel=noopener>16033df</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
