the interaction with people who know different things than you do; and the realization that everything is essentially the same if you look hard enough for it.  You may have to do a lot of things yourself, but that is also exciting to me.  In the States I call someone and they provide me a service.  Here it is not so easy.  Since we’ve moved into this compound I’ve been a plumber or supervised VERY closely another plumber, I’ve also been or supervised electricians, carpenters, IT consultants, glass dealers, gardeners, hydrologic engineers, structural engineer, construction engineer, mechanical engineer, interior designer and many other trades that I never would have had the opportunity to become elsewhere. </p><p>Supervising the building of these reservoirs will serve as the beginning of my learning curve for my next major project: building the first pool in this country and making it solar/wind powered and chemical free using a new salt chlorination system.</p><p>But first, back to my day job.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/75f2674ae1d085c6435bcf1389db67a328ad6834 target=_blank rel=noopener>75f2674</a> @ 2020-04-08</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
