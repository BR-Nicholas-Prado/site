Although it encompasses the volatile<br>Horn of Africa and the U.S. Navy's forward operating base in Djibouti<br>and will take over training tasks on the continent, it has no other<br>dedicated troop components. &ldquo;There are very few scenarios which would<br>create a U.S. military intervention&rdquo; in Africa, said one Africom<br>officer who was not authorized to speak on the record. &ldquo;Arguably, there<br>are no scenarios.&rdquo;
With its headquarters on the continent, liaison groups of 20 to 30<br>military personnel established in key countries and U.S. units brought<br>in to help with development and relief tasks, the command was<br>envisioned as an example to Africans of how their own armed forces and<br>civilians could work together for the good of their nations.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The trouble was, no one consulted the Africans. &ldquo;Very little was<br>really known by the majority of people or countries in Africa who were<br>supposed to know before such a move was made,&rdquo; said retired Kenyan army<br>Lt. Gen. Daniel Opande. Worry swept the continent that the United<br>States planned major new military installations in Africa.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you know the politics of Africa,&rdquo; said Opande, who has headed<br>U.N. peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone and Liberia, &ldquo;you know there<br>are certain very powerful countries who said, no, we are not interested<br>in having a headquarters here.&rdquo; South Africa and Nigeria were among<br>them, and their resistance helped persuade others.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Over the past seven years, the administration has more than tripled<br>U.S. assistance to Africa, to about $9 billion annually, nearly half of<br>which is spent on prevention and treatment for HIV-AIDS. U.S. military<br>training for African forces has steadily expanded, and U.S. troops have<br>undertaken humanitarian missions in several countries — digging wells,<br>building schools and providing medical care. Africom's budget request<br>for 2009 is about $400 million.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But despite the promise of new development and security<br>partnerships, many Africans concluded that Africom was primarily an<br>extension of U.S. counterterrorism policy, intended to keep an eye on<br>Africa's large Muslim population.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I think everyone thought it would be widely greeted as something<br>positive,&rdquo; the Africom officer said. &ldquo;But you suddenly have wide<br>publics that have no idea what we're talking about. . . . It was seen<br>as a massive infusion of military might onto a continent that was quite<br>proud of having removed foreign powers from its soil.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The United States &ldquo;equates terrorism with Islam,&rdquo; senior Kenyan<br>diplomat Bethuel Kiplagat said, and few African governments wanted to<br>be seen as inviting U.S. surveillance on their own people.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations<br>African affairs subcommittee, thought Africom was &ldquo;something that would<br>show real respect for Africa.&rdquo; But there was no question, Feingold<br>said, that the concept had &ldquo;a neocolonialist feel to it.&rdquo;
