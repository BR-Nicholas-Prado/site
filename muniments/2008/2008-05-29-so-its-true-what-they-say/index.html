and came out from behind the curtains. </p><p>The human sitting on my bed looked up drearily and it was a white guy and so wasn't the staff.  I smelled him before I could make out his face, the stench of his boozing preceded him. </p><p>I told the man that he was in the room.  He had his shirt off showing off a massive barrel chest with rock hard stomach (and I don't mean abs….<a href=http://www.benderball.com/>I love my abdominals….I love my belly….I love my abdominals</a>…this guy loved his food and booze).  He also was barefooted, had a head as big as a lion's, and of course he was wearing blue warm up pants.  AND SITTING ON MY BED.</p><p>We began to argue a bit about why he was there.  He got pretty belligerent with me for a bit and then got quite apologetic.  He started to pace around my room and ask me what I had done with his stuff.  I replied that this was my stuff and that he was in my room.  The door to the suite was open and the door to the suite across the hall was open.  I glanced out in the hall and back at him quickly (to make sure that the f-er wasn't going to appropriate any of my stuff) and there was about 18 room service trays in there with tin foil and bowls and cups everywhere.  His TV was on at about 84 trillion decibels. </p><p>During one of his apologetic swings I asked him what his room number was.  He said the room number on the door across the hall, but I could not make him comprehend that the room he was sitting in was not the room that he was given.  During one of his acrimonious swings he told me that he was a great customer here and that this was going to be his room.  I began to think that he wanted to trade rooms rather than just being drunken and disoriented.  During one of his apologetic swings he called down to the front desk, but either it was busy or he hung up on them.  During one of his acrimonious swings he told me that he was a captain and that I should respect him. </p><p>I thought, you're a bit old to be a captain.  I also thought, I'm a Captain too Mother F, now get the hell out of my room.  But despite my belligerent tendencies I belayed my sarcasm.  If you wonder why, *see supra.  *Although he was drunk, he probably had fought a time or two in his life while drunk and, HE WAS HUGE. </p><p>So after ten minutes of me telling him to get out of my room and him telling me to get out of his room and him swinging back and forth between sorry and angry and me thinking about the nice calm cool air outside and him not able to talk English very well and me not able to talk Russian at all, I called down to the front desk and asked them to send someone up.</p><p>The nice dudes from downstairs came right up and he listened to them.  After he got out of my room I locked the door.  It had not been locked before, because I was awake and was just relaxing.  So now I keep it lock, to keep the drunken Russian Bush Pilots out.  That's one of the stereotypes about Africa that I'm happy to leave in the realm of popular culture.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/9f9b466a389e91ff146b1ce547dafc4be37b7069 target=_blank rel=noopener>9f9b466</a> @ 2020-04-09</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
