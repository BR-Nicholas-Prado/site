Here's the video.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>For those of you not involved with the, all in all, rather small cryptocurrency community the people in that video are some of the bigger names within the community. The village elders if you will. Not sure the village actually chose them, but elders tend to be self appointed anyway &amp;ndash; at least at first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend and business partner, Preston, provided his response in &lt;a href="http://prestonbyrne.com/2014/08/14/tory-2/">this fine article&lt;/a>. I take an analogous, but distinct, view from Preston's.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="anarchists-go-experience-anarchy-or-shut-up">Anarchists: Go Experience Anarchy, Or Shut Up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the overarching points of the video is that Bitcoin is somehow sovereign, which I assume means a system unto itself. And I'm not simply picking out one word from many and obsessing about it. That is the entire point of a &amp;ldquo;Declaration of Independence&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; for a group to declare that it is no longer beholden to a prior sovereign and is now beholden to a different sovereign.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But who is the sovereign in which these individuals of common purpose are beholden to? Who knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm a relative outsider to this whole cryptocurrency thing. Sure, I'm trying to &lt;a href="https://erisindustries.com">build a business&lt;/a> which will utilize some of the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies. However, I am by no means a believer that a few cryptographic hashes and a fancy database somehow changes any of the real human dynamics which scientists, artists, philosophers, and the like have been pondering for a couple millennia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an outsider, it is (anthropologically) interesting to watch a bunch of (predominantly) white (predominantly) Americans (and Canadians) purport to claim that an interesting payment protocol will solve world peace, governmental overreach, and all the other ills of modernity. The idea that somehow because there are cryptographic hashes and p2p communications protocol that those will suddenly shift the paradigm of modernity and that we can reach a point where governments are unnecessary is&amp;hellip; I'm not sure what it is actually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've lived in anarchy. I know what it looks like when governance systems collapse. I have felt how easy elite capture becomes in such situations. I have tasted hyper inflation. I challenge anyone who identifies as an anarchist to actually go to Somalia &amp;ndash; or another area where governance systems have collapsed for a significant amount of time. Spend some time there. Talk to people about their lives. Understand what the hell you're talking about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whatever the participants&amp;rsquo; individual motives are I cannot speak to, I suspect that many would identify more with libertarian thinking than pure anarchical thinking. For those that do have anarchical tendencies, please see above. For those that have libertarian thinking, please see below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lesson-1-declaring-independence-is-an-emotional-exercise-building-a-system-is-a-rational-exercise">Lesson 1: Declaring Independence is an Emotional Exercise; Building a System is a Rational Exercise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In 1991 the elites of the Somalilanders &amp;ldquo;freedom&amp;rdquo; movement (it wasn't about freedom really, it was about capturing the state in the name of the Somalilanders) were forced by a bunch of emotional people to declare their independence from Somalia. Many at the time, and many today, question whether this heated, emotional, reaction was the correct decision. Nonetheless, it happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As most Democracy and Governance, Conflict Studies, and Crisis Situation scholars and practitioners understand declaring independence is the easy bit. Pretty words on paper (or in a video) don't mean anything in reality. They are simply those &amp;ndash; pretty words. They can inspire, sure, but beyond that they mean little.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the case of Somaliland it took about 13 years after the Declaration of Independence to have a really functional Constitution and the state building is still going on &amp;ndash; and likely will be for another two generations. It took a massively important leader with a real commitment to building a functional system who fought tooth and nail to build a constitution which was both responsive to constituent concerns while also setting the framework for a functional system. It took scholars, and discussion, and compromise, and &lt;em>work&lt;/em> to get there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question I have for those who participated in this video is this: are you actually interested in doing the work necessary to craft a system? Only time will tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lesson-2-if-you-want-to-sit-at-the-adults-table-act-like-adults">Lesson 2: If You Want to Sit At The Adults&amp;rsquo; Table Act Like Adults&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During my time in Somaliland I said the above more times than I could count. Mostly in response to idiotic stuff whatever Minister or other person of purported power who was sitting in some vaunted chair did. It would drive me crazy that Somalilanders in positions of power would drone on about how they were a &amp;ldquo;real state&amp;rdquo; but how they continued to fail to perform the most basic of governance functions. You can't have it both ways I would tell my friends. Either you need to do the work, make the sacrifices, and be your own state, or else you just need to shut up. More times than I currently care to count, I would watch the Somaliland government act as a rebel organization acts and then go on BBC Somali asking why the world wasn't treating them like a state. Most of the time the reason the &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; wasn't treating them like a state was because they weren't acting as a state acts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I view the cryptocommunity through a similar lens. It talks &amp;ndash; &lt;strong>at nauseum&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; about how it &lt;em>deserves&lt;/em> to be taken seriously. Really? Why? What has it done to &lt;em>deserve&lt;/em> being taken seriously? Certainly there is some very interesting technology that has been built. And that technology should be taken seriously. As technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Bitcoiners, and the cryptocommunity more generally, should not somehow be free from the normal rules which apply. If those inside the cryptocommunity want cryptocurrencies to be treated &lt;em>as&lt;/em> currency, then they must abide by the &lt;em>normal&lt;/em> rules which attend to handling money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These rules &lt;em>are&lt;/em> onerous, precisely because businesses which deal with folks&amp;rsquo; money are, well, dealing with folks&amp;rsquo; money. I do not understand why cryptocurrencies businesses should somehow get a bye as to providing proper safeguards, as has been agreed in the relevant states are necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lesson-3-real-systems-empower-professionals-and-root-out-scammers">Lesson 3: Real Systems Empower Professionals and Root Out Scammers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I was in Hargeisa some of the more interesting people I hung out with were folks who were trying to set up a governmental quality assurance system. There were a lot of problems that needed to be tackled, but foremost on the minds of these scientists (some of who had been trained locally some of whom had been trained abroad) was the difficulty of ensuring that medicines were proper. There was (and likely still is) a huge problem of knock-off drugs, mislabeled drugs, and the like. These scientists were trying to tackle this. Because it was putting the health of community members in jeopardy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed my time with these scientists and doers precisely because they saw a collective problem and were trying to do something about it &amp;ndash; despite the odds. The odds being that big importers who supported big actors within the government make more money off fake drugs than real ones. The odds being that quality assurance of medicines is not one of aid's current hot topics (and therefore there was no aid money to support their activities). The odds being that of all the problems in Hargeisa this was not the one that was on the tip of folks&amp;rsquo; minds &amp;ndash; except for when those folks had sick kids. Despite those odds, these guys were trying to do something to protect folks. And that was awesome from my perspective. They are a &lt;strong>long&lt;/strong> way from solving this issue, but they are trying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the cryptocommunity doing about rooting out scammers? There are, indeed, some efforts. And I hope that they continue, because the cryptocommunity has a huge scammers problem that needs to be addressed in a fundamental way. It isn't likely to happen with a technological solution; it is much more likely to happen via legal or social mechanisms. But so far we've only seen a few of these take place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time will tell how this all plays out. Indeed, most of this is about the community more generally than a response to the specifics of that video. I think there is some very interesting technology which bitcoin has brought to people's attention. It would be a shame if that technology was overshadowed by people projecting their issues and complaints with bigger systemic issues on it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday a &lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2014/04/difilippi">very interesting event&lt;/a> happened. And I had the pleasure to listen in. &lt;a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/pdefilippi">Primavera De Filippi&lt;/a> talked &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum&lt;/a> at a Berkman luncheon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those who do not know Berkman is a center at Harvard University. For those who do not know Harvard, welcome to earth. Berkman is officially the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. It is a joint research center housed in Harvard's Law School with the following mission:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Berkman Center's mission is to explore and understand cyberspace; to study its development, dynamics, norms, and standards; and to assess the need or lack thereof for laws and sanctions. We are a research center, premised on the observation that what we seek to learn is not already recorded. Our method is to build out into cyberspace, record data as we go, self-study, and share. Our mode is entrepreneurial nonprofit.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For more, see &lt;a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/about">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Primavera's talk had a lovely title, &lt;code>Ethereum: Freenet or Skynet?&lt;/code> and it really was a bit of an exploration of the ideas underlying this topic. Primavera first popped up on my radar on the Ethereum Skype group a couple of weeks ago, and I have read &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/03/decentralized-applications-built-bitcoin-great-except-whos-responsible-outcomes/">some&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/01/its-time-to-take-mesh-networks-seriously-and-not-just-for-the-reasons-you-think/">her work&lt;/a> on Wired, which I would highly recommend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her talk involved a quite fair introduction to Ethereum and what the community is trying to build. What was most interesting about listening to the live audio stream of the event was the questions which were asked by the Professors, researchers, and whomever else was in the room. The video of the talk is online and I would definitely encourage anyone within the Ethereum community to take a listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those who are not familiar with it, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain network (similar in nature, but distinct from, Bitcoin). Ethereum is touted as a mechanism which allows developers|lawyers to develop and deploy smart contracts which operate autonomously. Officially, there is the Ethereum boilerplate:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ethereum is a platform and a programming language that makes it possible for any developer to build and publish next-generation distributed applications. Ether, Ethereum's internal currency, powers its applications and acts as a &amp;lsquo;token of exchange&amp;rsquo; on the decentralized network. Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company governance, contracts and agreements of most kind, intellectual property, and even smart property thanks to hardware integration.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I had specific reactions to three of the veins of questioning which were raised during the question section of the discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="enforcement-or-administration">Enforcement or Administration?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A great proportion of the questions had to due with enforcement. And most of these questions sort of miss the point. This is exactly why I recommended at my previous talk that the Ethereum community does a slight pivot from the self-enforcing contracts verbiage to self-administering contracts. Enforcement is a term which gets lawyers all aflutter &amp;ndash; and rightly so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethereum could never really be self-enforcing until its blockchain becomes ubiquitous. Perhaps then it could be actually self-enforcing, but until such a time the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain mean that there is not actually much that Ethereum could do outside the context of the blockchain. Indeed, to a lawyer, enforcement connotes outside intervention in a private transaction. While Ethereum could build such things as Judges as a Service (JaaS&amp;hellip;? A term, perhaps coined by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mids106">Joris Bontje&lt;/a>) which would have outside determinative impact of a smart contract, those systems would not actually do the enforcing. They would predominantly do the interpretation. JaaS &lt;em>will indeed&lt;/em> have a dramatic impact on such an ecosystem, but the main roles which such services would play would be to interpret whether real world events met the metrics established in the proof of work, proof of effort, or proof of XYZ that are contained within the smart contract's algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, we are a way from this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This pedantic difference between the term &amp;ldquo;enforcement&amp;rdquo; and the term &amp;ldquo;administration&amp;rdquo; to lawyers is mostly why I prefer the latter to the former. Indeed, it is not only the isolation of the Ethereum blockchain which leads me to prefer the former term, but also it is the very nature of Ethereum. Ethereum contracts pay for computing cycles. Well, technically, the users of the contracts pay, but that nuance is still being worked out. What this means is that there is an incentive to build very small, single-use contracts and then to link those contracts together so that a user only pays for the computing cycles the user need in order to determine some outcome. Why is this even relevant? Because Ethereum will really shine as a business intelligence layer within a value stack of large organizations. It is less interesting to me whether an Ethereum contract and actually move money around than it is for Ethereum systems of contracts to be able to calculate the movement of value within the system based on a complex set of inputs, calculations, and outputs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think, for example, of a community based recycling system (which I'm working on a client with to outline how this could work on Ethereum). In such a system, recycled goods would be collected from individual households by individual contractors, brought to a community based &amp;ldquo;collection center&amp;rdquo; where they are resold back into the value chain. All of the individuals involved (whether as contractors who pick up the goods or individuals who give their goods or marketers of the system) have a certain cost to the ecosystem and bring certain benefits. The overall revenue which such a system receives should then be distributed within the ecosystem based on a calculation of the overall cost to the system of individual participants and overall benefit which individual participants bring to the system. Try calculating that in Excel or Sage! But Ethereum smart contracts could do that. If they had knowledge of the overall revenue stream they could perform a complex series of calculations where individual contracts have inputs, actions, and outputs and because these contracts can talk to one another they can &amp;ldquo;act&amp;rdquo; such that everyone within the ecosystem can have transparency for where all of the value is going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key in the above scenario is not exactly moving the money around, it is in producing a ledger and profit-loss sheet for the system. Whether money is performed by a human or a payroll system with an API hook to the accountant contract is largely immaterial to understanding the real &lt;em>value&lt;/em> that self-administering contracts can bring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above presents what I think is a very interesting possibilities and when we talk about Ethereum as being self-enforcing it gets lots of people off on a tangent about pulling computers out of smart cars so they cannot talk to the blockchain rather than thinking through what value the blockchain system could bring. By talking about self-administering contracts we can &amp;ndash; to a certain degree &amp;ndash; avoid this tangent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-relationship-to-the-state">The Relationship to the State&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a long, tough question to answer. And no one will likely get it right for the foreseeable future. How do we strike the right balance between public rights of &lt;em>all&lt;/em> and the private rights of &lt;em>me&lt;/em>? Who knows. We humans have been struggling with that question since we started thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other major portion of the questions were focused on the relationship that the Ethereum ecosystem may have to states. One of the most interesting veins of discussion was about whether blockchain technology would be more or less efficient than the state at enforcing contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an important question which I have been considering at length over the course of the most recent weeks. One of the sub-veins of discussion had to do with the links between smart contracts and court enforcement. I was asked this a lot after my last talk at the most recent &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Ethereum-Meetup/">Amsterdam Ethereum Meetup&lt;/a>. For the time being, I am recommending to clients that if they want &amp;lsquo;real world&amp;rsquo; enforcement for the time being that they should build a normal contract and add the Ethereum contract as an addendum to that normal contract. This would force the court to either enforce &amp;ndash; or ignore &amp;ndash; such a contract but it would have the benefit of having some real world enforcement if such was essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a design, admittedly, would not really address the question of efficiency of administration of contracts (by which I mean determining whether specific metrics within a contract have been met in the real world rather than actually taking a house away from someone because someone has determined that it was sold). One of the important points which I wish would have been raised by the law professors is that most contracts that go to court, go to court because there is a question about the meaning of some terms. Contracts which are clear but only need to determine if some event happened or not predominantly settle or are arbitrated. Contracts that go to a court are &amp;ndash; for the most part &amp;ndash; those that are not clearly worded. Ethereum is drastically more efficient that the state with regard to this particular metric. Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contracts as code mean that contracts cannot be ambiguous as to their meaning. Certainly there can be differences of opinion as to whether a particular metric was satisfied in the real world (What does it mean if I promise to give my best efforts to achieve a certain outcome &amp;ndash; such clauses are popular in employment contracts?). Certainly there could be bugs. Certainly slight differences in code structure can lead to drastically different outcomes (Does shipping you a good to the wrong address mean &amp;ldquo;I shipped it&amp;rdquo;? Yes. Does it mean &amp;ldquo;I shipped it to you&amp;rdquo;? No.). But what contracts as code cannot be is ambiguous. We will always know &amp;ndash; determinatively &amp;ndash; what the outcomes will be (as long as we know what the inputs are). After all it is just code. This addresses what I suspect are a large proportion of contractual disputes that end up on court.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As to the overall efficiency of the state enforcing contracts, I'm skeptical. One of the questioners raised land property rolls. The argument basically boiled down to &amp;ndash; we have built these systems; therefore they are more efficient. That may be true and this particular moment but it avoids the more interesting question, which is whether in the long run the current systems used by the state to &lt;em>track&lt;/em> property rights (and to be honest this is, ultimately the state's roll unless someone comes to them and tells them that their property rights are being violated &amp;ndash; in which case the state will send its police to a house and kick out the squatters). The State is not going anywhere, and I &amp;ndash; for one &amp;ndash; am not anarchic. The State can bring value to blockchain ecosystems without ending up at a authoritarian dystopia because the State is simply a collection of humans and we humans live in a tension between the devils and angels that sit on all of our shoulders. But setting up blockchain technology in opposition to state systems is wrongheaded. Why couldn't the State use a blockchain system to track property in the short or medium term. It could keep the human (police) element of the enforcement, but blockchain technologies are very powerful, decentralized systems which are cheaper, faster, and more resilient than what the state could actually build (because central points of failure will always be central points of effort for attackers).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="freenet-or-skynet">Freenet or Skynet?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Overall, I think Primavera did a quite good job at exploring the possibilities on both sides of this false choice. Indeed, these are not the only two choices and as with most things in live, the likely result will be somewhere between the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We humans are constantly in a struggle between competing ideas, visions, histories, and norms. The very nature of this competition (which underlies our philosophies of democracy, markets, the scientific process, and free speech rights, among many other things) keeps us somewhere in between a utopic and dystopic future. Not to mention the impetus for nearly all of all our greatest art. The tension between these ideals is likely to always exist as long as we humans exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While both of the extremes are interesting on an analytical and strategic level to discuss, discussion of these two ends of a spectrum presents discussants with a false choice. The reality of the development of any system is rarely either of the extremes and usually ends up somewhere betwixt the tween. Ethereum, as with most technology, is a value neutral proposition. It is just code. It can be used for good ends or foul ends, but the code is the code. Like the HoneyBadger, it doesn't give a fuck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What Ethereum will allow us to do, and some of the participants and Primavera herself did a good job of exploring, is to explore different normative bases for ideas. How would contracts work if we wanted to code forgiveness? Mercy? I have no idea, but these ideas are worth exploring. As I said in my most recent talk, the possibility of exploring, studying, and utilizing different normative bases for transactions could be exceedingly powerful for us as humans. This is why I'm spending time contributing in my own small way to the Ethereum ecosystem. The possibilities are there, it is up to the humans to figure out what we will do with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wnFqOfR5a7I" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My name is Casey Kuhlman and I'm an American lawyer. Currently, I'm running a small law firm with our headquarters in Somalia. In particular, we work mainly in the north of Somalia which is a self-declared independent state of Somaliland. I've been in Somaliland for coming up on six years now and my practice has a wide focus on law building, corporate governance work, compliance work, and corporate transactions. For the past few years I have spent most of my time building, reviewing, negotiating, and amending contracts for clients which range from international organizations to international NGOs to international companies all the way down to individuals. I live in Somaliland for some of the year and I live here in Holland for some of the year because my wife is also a lawyer and she works down at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. At this point, part of our business is continuing in the Somali region and another portion of our business is starting to work with clients in the blockchain sector to develop systems of contracts and the like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I first became interested in blockchain technology last summer when the main money transmitter company in the Somali region faced a threat that their bank account in the UK with Barclays was going to be closed due to compliance concerns within Barclays. If that company would have closed its operations, that would have drastically affected our business. We have an incorporated entity in the US which allows us to receive wire transfers to our US bank account and then we transmit those to our headquarters in Somaliland via this money transfer company so that we can pay our operating expenses. That concern led me to some of the thought documents about the (currently latent) power of blockchain technology to reduce remittance expenses. Over time, it was probably inevitable that when Ethereum started percolating through the community that I would become interested.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-this-talk-about">What is this talk about?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>What I'm here to talk about today is how Ethereum looks from the eyes of one lawyer who works in a place which many would say has an immature rule of law. I would not necessarily say that, but it has been said by others many times that the Somali region is a libertarian's paradise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems to me that it should be a testament to the power of the Ethereum idea at how much community involvement there has been in this idea. That is utterly fantastic. However, within any community there must be a balance of different perspectives. To date, it seems from my persective that we have a great amount of developer interest in Ethereum. Indeed, how many here tonight would identify as developers? And how many would identify as lawyers? And how many would identify as both? That is more or less what I expected after reviewing the RSVP list on the meetup site. So this talk is meant to somewhat balance the perspectives and provide one lawyer's perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-barebones-of-it-all">The BareBones of It All.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the things which I like best about living in a developing country is that it strips away most of the superficial layers in the systems which run our modern world. I have had the chance to learn about environmental interference with microwave transmission of internet data because when our internet goes down I want to know why. I have learned about supply line resiliency when I buy a gas cooker but the ship bringing a year's supply of gas sinks in the harbor because it hasn't been dredged in however many years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these systems which we take for granted in more developed countries, systems which just work, we do not often have a reason to learn about them. But in developing countries when there is a shock to a system which that system is not resilient to, then you have to learn about the system when you have to cook with deforesting charcoal instead of efficient gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same thing has applied to my law practice. I am forced in my daily practice to strip back all of the superficial layers of the legal systems which I originally learned about and dig into the mechanics of the system to find what works and what does not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in this talk, I have tried to distill out three rules which I always think through (maybe not always consciously) when I am building, reviewing, or negotiating contracts. Along the way I'm hoping to be able to point out why I am very excited for the future of blockchain technology, and especially the smart contracts ecosystem which the Ethereum community is building.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rule-1-use-your-funnels">Rule 1: Use Your Funnels&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Developers understand stacks, so let us start with a stack in the software engineering sense of that word. In a stack you have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>software that moves around memory references and does other fundamental things very close to a processor's core;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>software higher up in the stack that makes information so that it can be added, modified, and changed;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and software higher up in the stack still that makes things look pretty.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Developers work on different portions of the stack at different times in order to accomplish different things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In law we also have a stack, but I think it is better to think in terms of a funnel than a stack. In a legal funnel you have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>things which prohibit certain actions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>things which compel certain actions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If we were to plot these &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; as a measure of the AMOUNT of actions they can PROHIBIT or COMPEL against the SPECIFICITY of those actions then we would build a graph that looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we think about building a contract we have to internally build this funnel for ourselves. Part of this funnel, the part I call the COMPLIANCE FUNNEL is out of our control as the parties to an individual contract. Those things are required by living or operating in a certain geographical jurisdiction and|or by operating in a particular sector. The rest of this funnel, the part I call the CONTRACTING FUNNEL is in our control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proportion of the entire funnel which is a compliance funnel and which is a contracting funnel will differ based on time, geography, and subject matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-funnels-help">Why Funnels Help?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>These funnels help us build contracts because they allow us to write fewer words. Think through in your favorite programming language the first time that someone coded a web server for that language. Unless it is an ultramodern language which had web services in a 0.0.1 release, it is likely that the first time a webserver was built in the language that it contained a huge amount of code. And the second time it was built it was able to use some functionality from some sort of a standard library. And the third time it was built it was able to use some functionality from a low level, third-party library built on top of the standard library. And eventually we have a situation where frameworks, low level, and standard libraries all work together so that I can say:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">require &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;sinatra&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
require &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;haml&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
get &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span>
haml &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">:index&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>For those that do not know, this is a very simple web application using Ruby's Sinatra framework. Underneath these five lines of code are an entire framework of code, from Sinatra, from other third party libraries, and from Ruby's Standard Library that allow me to have a web application in five lines of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funnels are like that. They allow us lawyers to develop contracts with less &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; than if we needed to code the entire stack. The first person who &amp;ldquo;coded&amp;rdquo; an employment contract had to build out tons of if|then statements into the contract. Over time, as employment laws and commercial norms develop those two areas can reduce the length and complexity of any individual contract because that individual contract is able to rely upon the standards from the law and commercial norms just as a Sinatra application relies on the stack developed by the framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-this-important-for-ethereum">Why is This Important for Ethereum?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first thing I want to point out is that while many lawyers and clients tend to want to &amp;ldquo;avoid&amp;rdquo; laws, they do provide a valid function &amp;ndash; just as frameworks do in the coding world. This function simplifies the nature of specific contract building greatly. Ethereum gives us a chance to re-envision our commercial relationship with &amp;ldquo;the law&amp;rdquo;. In a way which is not currently possible in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second thing I want to point out is that Ethereum gives us an opportunity to develop, test, and perfect different ideas of how contracts and relationships (which I'm going to talk a bit more about in a minute) should work. If I want to develop a dynamic web application I have a vast array of choices. Do I want to do it in: Node, Ruby, Python, PHP, .Net? Do I want to do it in Express, Sinatra, Twisted, Wordpress, Drupal, or some other framework? All of these choices are there and available for me to use. They all have their proclivities, predilictions, advantages, and disadvantages. I choose which is best for me, program on top of it and try to use its advantages while minimizing its disadvantages. I see Ethereum playing out in a similar way where different legal ideas, norms, and contractual structures are held either off the blockchain in open source repositories or on the blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third thing I want to point out is that in order for Ethereum to be able to leverage frameworks, contracts on the blockchain will need to be able to operate together in a fundamental way while contracts residing off the blockchain in open source repositories can have their own way of interacting with each other. So when we think through what should be on the blockchain or off the blockchain in repositories it is important to think through this. It is like the difference between referencing a Google hosted jQuery library where I only need to specify a particular version and using a node library which I will need to connect to an API and perhaps another point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rule-2-keep-contracts-social">Rule 2: Keep Contracts Social&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At their core contracts are a set of rules that provide for an interaction between different entities with divergent goals, capabilities, and resources. Building contracts, as with coding, is both an art and a science. The science part of contracting is largely making sure that for this particular instance that the funnel is properly aligned and the contract is built so that the funnel is workable. The social side of contracting is predominantly where the art comes into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I said, I work in Somalia and Somaliland much of the time. There we have a predominance of oral agreements. I am not a fan of oral agreements, but I have come to respect their cost effective nature. The reason that I have a problem with oral agreements is that they suffer from a memory bias and are not precise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Written contracts, on the other hand are a way to balance precision against many other concerns which exist within complex social systems. Written contracts give us an ability to have both precision and individuality in the face of complexity. This is a powerful idea when you think about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the challenges for contract developers in the traditional contract development space is how do we work through the interests and incentives of the parties to craft a contract which is designed to succeed while also providing our clients with appropriate safeguards in cases where it does not succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most contracts, most of the time, are not breached. And those that are breached are often breached in a way which does not require a court to enforce. It is only a minuscule amount of contracts which have to go to court in order to be enforced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Well, I suspect that for most people most of the time, that when they agree to do something they will follow through on that or will be prepared to face the consequences for not following through on that promise. We are social creatures and it makes sense in a social construct that our promises will be vital for our future ability to conduct whatever activities we want to conduct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of our nature inclination to think that we will follow through on our promises, we tend to not even want to have specific breach clauses in our contracts. In my own practice, when I ask people why they have gone into a multimillion dollar business with only an oral agreement this is what I'm often told. That trust is so vital to the daily workings of the business and demanding or requesting a written contract at the beginning would start the venture off on the wrong foot. My clients who work in the more developed world understand that trust is all well and good but it is also good to work through the process of building a written contract for the venture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This topic is one area in which I may differ from many in who are also into blockchain technology because I feel that trust between individual humans is something to be lauded not to be avoided. While I understand fully the reasoning behind the trust-less movement, I think that organizations work best when there are trust-less backstops in combination with trust between individual actors within the organization. I agree with those who advocate for less trust within the system that having tension within the system is good because it forces the system to be adapted to diverse parties. However, I feel that tension within the system can easily become friction within the system if the contract is not properly designed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my opinion, this is one of the most difficult areas which the Ethereum community will need to work out. My main concerns with respect to keeping contracts social if they live on the blockchain are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Verifying offer and acceptance should be integral to the process. As I understand it right now, contracts seem to be deployable to the blockchain based on only one party. That is a unilateral agreement, which is fine, but it is something that we should look at carefully because unilateral agreements have difficulties. Unilateral agreements can work, but they do not work as well as contracts which are bilateral or multilateral agreements between entities &amp;ndash; each of which maintaining its own position. Certainly Ethereum contracts can be designed as multilateral contracts, but the default setting of Ethereum contracts &amp;ndash; at this point &amp;ndash; is essentially unilateral. If the blockchain defaulted to multisignature deployment and allowed single signatory deployment of contracts to the blockchain, I would be much more comfortable than the current situation. From a legal point of view this will be difficult in the real world which mostly requires affirmative showing of both an offer and acceptance in order to have a valid contract. In the real world we do this by drafting, reviewing, and signing contracts. But, the contracts that I've seen on Ethereum are not currently designed in this way. In my opinion this is an area which should be a core part of the protocol rather than left to contract designers because it is utterly fundamental.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other side of the coin, Ethereum will allow us as a community to design different interactivity points which can provide a trust-less base but also develop trust by the community involved in the contract. For example, the concepts of DAO's are likely, if properly conceived and structured, to really build real trust within a community. The automatic administration of contracts which can redistribute value within a network are a way to build trust within the humans in the network because of the automatic way in which smart contracts will work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most exciting aspects of Ethereum is that the nature of how contracts are administered (which I prefer over the more difficult word enforce) is most advantageous when there is a simple transfer of value. Since contracts can only live on the blockchain and talk to other contracts on the blockchain and/or transmit value within entities on the blockchain, this constrains how contract designers think through incentives and outcomes. I'm hopeful that by constraining how contracts are administered and by opening up the funnels, that a variety of new incentive structures with different outcomes can be crafted. This could allow for a great expansion of innovation within contracting which is relatively stagnate and where innovation amounts to using word A instead of word B rather than fundamentally looking at incentives, outcomes, and parties to realign interactions between entities in different and interesting ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rule-3-define-the-decision-space">Rule 3: Define the Decision Space&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This rule is often overlooked by professional contract lawyers, and I think that is to their detriment. This applies to all contracts, but it is more interesting to think about in the terms of multilateral contracts &amp;ndash; in particular organizational governance contracts. What do I mean by decision spaces? I tend to think of organizations in terms of ven diagrams of duties. Each individual node within the organization has particular duties which are unique to that individual node and also most nodes will have duties which are shared with other nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In traditional contracting these decision spaces are used to define what, for example, a board does vis a vis what the managers do vis a vis what the shareholders do. It works with many other types of contracts as well and I almost always keep this in mind when I'm reviewing or drafting any type of contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the area among these three topics where I think that Ethereum will be the most transformative. At this point the decision space concept is not very well defined where it likely should be, for example in employment or consulting contracts. Mostly these contracts have an overview of the decision space allocation between the parties which lacks specifics. In traditional contracts this is needed so that the lawyers to not have to do an amendment to the contract. But in Ethereum changes to decision spaces will likely be nominal. Because contracts can be linked together you can have events &amp;ndash; such as a new department built, or a new hire for a new position, or a change in by laws &amp;ndash; which will be events that can &amp;ldquo;bubble up through the DOM&amp;rdquo; of the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In conclusion, I just wanted to say that although many lawyers get a bad name and that many people have had bad experiences with lawyers that not all of us are jerks. Some lawyers, indeed, are jerks, but Internet Explorer 6 was a jerk of a program. This is important because those of us lawyers who have been doing contracts for a while should be participating in the development of the Ethereum ecosystem by bringing to the table the lessons that we've learned along the way. This has been my entry into that lexicon by laying out three rules which I always try to keep in mind when I'm working with any contract: use your funnels, keep contracts social, and define the decision space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

It has been fun to think through the possibilities of virtual automatic contracts and how those could really work in developing countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="background-and-introduction">Background and Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Earlier this week I had the distinct pleasure of attending the &lt;a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum&lt;/a> meetup in Amsterdam to learn more about how virtual automatic contracts (or as they call them smart contracts) work within the Ethereum blockchain. For those that may not know, Ethereum is a derivative of Bitcoin but focused on being a platform for virtual automatic contracts. Although loosely based on Bitcoin's blockchain technology, it is meant as an expansion of that technology into a larger system. Here is how Ethereum describes itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ethereum is a platform and a programming language that makes it possible for any developer to build and publish next-generation decentralized applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company governance, contracts and agreements of most kind, intellectual property, and even smart property thanks to hardware integration.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea is to build a scripting language and combine that with the &amp;ldquo;permanence&amp;rdquo; of blockchain technology and allow &amp;ldquo;contracts&amp;rdquo; within the sandboxed blockchain to take decisions (based on their code) and to interact with other contracts (again based on their code). This combination of a scripting language and blockchain technology opens up an amazing range of possibilities. For now, this technology is very much pre-alpha stage, but there is a LOT of momentum behind it and getting 25 people or so at a meetup in Amsterdam shows they are doing a fabulous amount of PR work to spread the word about what they are doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the meetup there was a lot of talk about lawyer|coders (or coder|lawyers, not sure which). As I'm pretty sure 99% of the room were mainly coders or financial tech people, the concept of a coder|lawyer was mentioned almost with a laugh in the room (or at least with a sly smile). Well, we are out there. The advantage which coder|lawyers have over either coders or lawyers is that we understand to a large extent how contracts work in the real world but also understanding what computers can do. This gives us a special place within the virtual automatic contracts world. If you are a lawyer and a hacker I would encourage you to read the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper">Ethereum Whitepaper&lt;/a> and think about participating.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-an-ethereum-package-manager">Why an Ethereum Package Manager&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In any open source ecosystem a range of products to hack on the system needs to be developed. A method of testing applications (or contracts in the Ethereum system) needs to be developed. A method of simulating applications || contracts needs to be developed. A method of compiling applications || contracts needs to be developed. An easy method of deploying applications || contracts needs to be developed. There is a whole range of infrastructure systems which need to be in place for the system to really function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most vital aspects of the ecosystem's infrastructure is some sort of a package manager that will assist in pulling packages from other sources and doing other things to assist in the development and deployment of packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nearly every open source ecosystem I know of has various package managers that automate a lot of different aspects of the ecosystem (depending on what the ecosystem needs, etc.). Ruby has Rubygems and Bundler. Node has NPM. Python has Pip. ZSH has antigen. OSX has Homebrew. VIM has Vundle. Sublime has Sublime Package Manager. You get the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have started coding out an Ethereum Package Manager &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://github.com/watershedlegal/epm">EPM&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; because I think it will very soon be necessary if anyone is going to build anything more than a simple, isolated contract. One of the things that struck me during the Ethereum meetup this week was that there is going to be a lot of boilerplate redundancy within contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, at the beginning of nearly every contract will be a check to ensure that the contract has enough currency to pay the network for running itself. The way that Ethereum is structured is that contracts need to pay the network for two different things: (1) they pay for the amount of storage they are using, (2) they pay for the number of computing cycles they use. Storage is paid for when the contract deploys onto the network (or when it changes its storage allocation as I understand it). But computing cycles are paid for as they are used. Contracts can hold their own value in credits which are then paid to the network (or other sources depending on the contract's code) on each computing cycle. This means that a contract, if it is running low on funds, does not want to be in a position of executing part of its code and then running low on credit. This will leave the contract in a weird state and generally F up your system. The only part that lawyer|coders need to understand is to build in a small IF statement check at the beginning of the contract to make sure that it does not run unless the contract has enough credits to run the entire script. This is some of the boilerplate that will be required for the Ethereum virtual automatic contracts and nearly every single contract will have this boilerplate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another example will be the self-amendment terms of the contract. Note how I used the lawyer word &amp;ldquo;terms&amp;rdquo; there but one could equally use the coder term &amp;ldquo;settings&amp;rdquo; as I'm referring to the same thing. On a technical level, Ethereum contracts are able to modify their own code. This is equal parts wonderful and utterly terrifying (although the utterly terrifying concern is probably deferred until our contracts get better by an exponential amount). Until we need to worry about sentient bots that can send war drones to kill those that we don't like using the Ethereum blockchain and its IRL connections, we simply need to be worried about the terms under which the contract can amend itself. At times we will want to restrict the contract so that it cannot amend itself full stop. At times we will want to restrict the contract so that only amendments sent via a particular Ethereum address (be that either some master contract &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; this contract on a hierarchy tree or a human with an Ethereum address) will be actionable. At times we will want to restrict the contract so that only amendments sent via a particular set of Ethereum addresses (usually this would be after some sort of a voting mechanism was executed by those other set of Ethereum nodes) will be actionable. There may be other iterations but it is likely that these are the three main iterations. Again, this is boilerplate and should be written into any contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lawyers work with boilerplate via Word templates. &lt;a href="https://github.com/rmoc/rmoc.github.io/blob/master/about/index.md">Don't get me&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown">started on Word&lt;/a>. Coders work with boilerplate via packages or generators. If Ethereum is going to be easy for lawyer|coders to utilize, then we will need some sort of a system which allows us to work with boilerplate. I'm hoping that EPM will be at least one way to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="three-functions-of-ethereum-package-manager">Three Functions of Ethereum Package Manager&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I've tentatively structured the Ethereum Package Manager to conduct primarily three functions. First, Ethereum Package Manager will serve as an easy way to pull, push, and upgrade your boilerplate. Second, Ethereum Package Manager will simplify your contract development sequence by simplifying the commands to lint, test, simulate, compile, and deploy your contracts. Third, Ethereum Package Manager will provide an (opt out) mechanism for users to support the Ethereum infrastructure with tips. In this sense, EPM is a bit larger than some other package managers in scope.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="package-management-functions">Package Management Functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>EPM will allow you to pull, push, and upgrade boilerplate. This will be necessary so that boilerplate provisions can be structured in such a way that the community can achieve consensus on best practices. Also it will simplify the deployment of standardized contracts to the Ethereum blockchain. For example, if a lawyer|coder was tasked with building a decentralized autonomous guild and it needed to pull bounty contracts for some aspects of the guild's operations, then EPM could be used to pull those contracts which best suit the system the lawyer was trying to build. These could be kept in proprietary git repositories or on Github (obviously with a preference for the latter) and pulled into the system in the amounts and with the constants as needed for eventual deployment of the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="package-development-functions">Package Development Functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>EPM will provide a simplified way to work with your contracts. After EPM is used to pull in standardized provisions &amp;amp;&amp;amp; || standardized contracts. Then the lawyer|coder will want to edit, lint, test, simulate, and compile those contracts (or system of contracts) before deploying them to the Ethereum blockchain. EPM in combination with other systems will simplify this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-support-functions">Infrastructure Support Functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The last primary function EPM will provide is a mechanism to support those developing EPM, testing suites, simulators (which are really REPLs I guess), compilers, etc. While it is always great to give to a community, it is even better to be able to do what you love and pay the bills. This is always the difficulty with open source systems and a modest tip mechanism is, I hope, not overly controversial. How it will work is that within the configuration files, EPM will place the addresses of the infrastructure tools it knows you are using along with an equalized percentage of tip across those tools. These can be changed globally or per project and can also be taken out completely if the lawyer|coder cannot afford to send tips or does not agree with the system (hey, I never pay Kiva every time I make a new loan because I'm a freeloader like that.) In the configuration file will be three lines: the address to send the tip to, the percentage of the deployment tip, and the (optional) message to send with the tip. Then when the contract is deployed, the deployer will tell EPM the total amount of tip to be sent to the infrastructure system. EPM will then distribute this based upon the configuration files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="status-of-epm">Status of EPM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is simply an idea at this point. The TODO includes everything. I am hoping to have some amount of this functionality deployed by the end of next week. In any event, Ethereum is not yet launched and is only working off the testnet so there is still some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ethereum-packages">Ethereum Packages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order for EPM to be most beneficial to the community, the community should agree on certain conventions as to how packages, contracts, and individual contract provisions will be structured. These are my thoughts on the matter, and I welcome all input and thoughts on the matter. For now, I would recommend that EPM be fairly stupid and simply pull in lines of boilerplate, mash those together than then let the human work out any problems that the assembled mass creates. Later, it will be good to have some standardization within the contract provision system so that EPM can be smarter about how it pulls in and combines provisions. It will take a while for the Ethereum ecosystem to reach that point, so for now the conventions I'm proposing below would be fairly rudimentary in nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ethereum-contract-files-xxxxethereum-contract">Ethereum Contract Files: XXXX.ethereum-contract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ethereum contract files should be written in a single language which one of the compilers can parse. There should not be portions of the contract file written in one of the compiler languages and another portion written in another of the compiler languages. Ethereum contract files should be fully composed contracts which can be compiled and deployed with minimal user interaction (perhaps adding some addresses or constants to the script before compilation and deployment). Ethereum contract files should reside in a git repository (for now).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ethereum-provision-files-xxxxxethereum-provision">Ethereum Provision Files: XXXXX.ethereum-provision&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ethereum provision files should be written in a single compiler language, and should reside in a git repository, but need not be fully complete contracts. Indeed, most provisions should not be complete contracts and instead should only provide a single unit of functionality to the contract. EPM will be built so that it can pull various XXXX.ethereum-provision files from various git repos and assemble those into a guess at what the final, assembled contract will look like. For example, if one lawyer|coder writes the definitive contract amount check provision (see above) and puts that on Github then others can instantly pull that provision into the contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, I've thought about breaking prefaces and postfaces and substantive provisions out into their own files so that the package manager will know that prefaces go before the substantive provisions and postfaces go after the substantive provisions. However, after reflection it seems that such a system would be more restrictive than what is laid out above and at this point it would be more beneficial to have the system remain neutral as to where lawyer|coders place certain provisions within their contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general idea with ethereum-provision files would be to allow people to pull in different types of provisions into a cohesive contract to be edited, tested, and deployed quickly and simply. As the ecosystem develops, I would hope that this will allow the quickest deployment of contracts onto the system for users (predominantly for lawyer|coders who are more the former than the latter).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ethereum-package-manager-configuration">Ethereum Package Manager Configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>EPM will work based on configuration files and contract definition files. There are two configuration files that any instance of EPM will work with. Residing in &lt;code>~/.epm/config.toml&lt;/code> will be the global configuration file. It will be in TOML format. A local configuration file will also be used only in the context of the current working directory. This is how many package managers operate and it will allow the user to set global defaults as well as per project configuration. The details for the EPM configuration are in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/watershedlegal/epm">README&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, in order to define contracts, in the project root will live various XXXXXX.ethereum-definition files (not sure that name will stick and other ideas would be welcome). These will be simple text files and will tell EPM where the contract provisions (or contract) resides that it will pull in and build. Within the contract definition file (which would be somewhat analogous to a Gemfile or your .zshrc or .vimrc file if you were using antigen or vundle) a user will be able to note an entire repository (in which case EPM will pull in all the files in that repository), a single file within a repository, or even a range of lines from a single file within a repository. Since EPM will know where the repository is and since repositories are version controlled, this will allow EPM to update the boilerplate down the road in case certain best practices change, security flaws within contracts are determined, or simply because things have changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="questions-feedback-thoughts">Questions, Feedback, Thoughts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Feel free to add any comments, questions, or feedback below, or, better, drop an issue on &lt;a href="https://github.com/watershedlegal/epm/issues">Github&lt;/a>. As I said above, I'll be working on this over the coming week and hope to have something moderately useful within a week or two.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have been droning on about virtual automatic contracts &lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/on-virtual-currencies.html">for&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/structuring-automatic-virtual-contracts.html">a&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/the-latent-natural-synergies-between-cryptocurrencies-opendata-development.html">few&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/automatic-virtual-contracts-for-humanitarian-relief.html">posts&lt;/a> now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the by, today is a bit of an exciting day because later this evening I will be going to the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Ethereum-Meetup/">Ethereum meetup in Amsterdam&lt;/a>. This will be an interesting opportunity for me to speak with others who are interested in exploring the possibilities of virtual automatic contracts generally and also to see specifically some more details as to how Ethereum smart contracts will work. I am particularly interested in how to test and deploy contracts onto the network. For the most part the Ethereum scripting language appears to be relatively straight-forward, but the key thing I'm currently lacking before I really dig deep and start coding out provisions and contract structure templates is how the contracts get from my text editor where I draft what I think they should be to a test environment to make sure they are not throwing any errors I did not want and then into the actual Ethereum network. Understanding how that test and deploy will work is crucial else you will not be able to get your contracts to work within the system. This piece is not necessarily about Ethereum, in the vein of my previous pieces this is more generalized in nature and should apply to other smart contract protocols that are coming online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If virtual automatic contracts are going to be even moderately interesting beyond simple financial derivatives of other virtual currencies or products then paradigmatic linkages to real world events must be developed. I have been thinking about this for a while because if &lt;a href="http://watershedlegal.com">Watershed&lt;/a> wants to be able to support the development of DAOs and other smart contract mechanisms &amp;ndash; which is where we are attempting to go over the course of the year &amp;ndash; then the real key to development of any contract which will have more than an academic interest is how to link to the real world. So far, I have come up with three paradigms that I think would to a certain degree work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="irl-paradigm-linkage-1---data">IRL Paradigm Linkage 1 - Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I stated in my previous post on open data and development, data which is aggregated by an agency or organization which the parties agrees is neutral and has no incentive to skew the data in either direction could be agreed to by the parties as a provider of machine consumable IRL data which smart contracts can use to make &amp;ldquo;decisions&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;spend&amp;rdquo; its money appropriately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will steal an example of how this could work from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ethereumcharles">Charles Hoskinson&lt;/a> (who for the record is quite eloquent at explaining what Ethereum is up to). Let's say you wanted to develop a crop insurance mechanism. Let's say that you found there was a single causal link between crop returns and rainfall and that for the most part you were not interested in (for whatever reason) insuring against vector or pest crop failure or any other failure. You were only going to insure crops against a lack of rainfall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You sell a product whereby at the beginning of the season farmers send via mobile money a certain amount of money (which would be a factor of how much land they were insuring). When the farmer sends the money, from a legal point of view this would constitute the contract offer. This insurance policy would then be verified by some agent that you have in the field to insure, for example, that the farmer actually has the land and has cultivated the crop. After field verification then your firm would respond with an SMS to the farmer that you have accepted his offer of the contract and that the contract is deployed. Once the contract is deployed the humans get out of the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the course of the term of the contract, the smart contract would be given permission to speak to a national weather service data feed that aggregates rainfall data in the farmer's area (and presumably other areas as well). Upon the expiry of the contract term (which would likely be structured to be around harvest time), the smart contract would pay out in an inverse relationship to the amount of rain which actually fell and would rely upon the government's national weather service for it to &lt;em>know&lt;/em> what that amount of rainfall was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other real world questions which could be used by virtual automatic contracts by linking to data feeds would include some of the following: did you ship the item(s) &amp;ndash; verified by a UPS feed? Did you build the web site &amp;ndash; verified by a Travis or Jenkins build result? These would be more specific in nature than general data feeds such as weather data but for the most part they could be used in certain situations. For example, where the contracting party that was seeking to outsource some specific portion of a web application or coding project to a contractor built tests for that and wrote the contract such that the coder was paid automatically upon the Travis or Jenkins build passing the specs &amp;ndash; that would work. However, this would not always work. For example, if the contracting party did not have the time or ability to write the specs and was looking to outsource the build of the specs along with the build of the feature then it is unlikely that building a Travis or Jenkins build feed into the virtual automatic contract would be wise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data can be a powerful tool for understanding &lt;em>some&lt;/em> real world events. Primarily data feeds should be used where you need high level, aggregated information which applies generally to a specific group of people (based on age, class, location, profession, etc.) but not to specific people. Also data feeds as IRL linkages for virtual automatic contracts will be important where you also want to tap into a specific type of event but not to specific events. The basic idea of when you would want to build a virtual automatic contract to link to data feeds is when you want to zoom out from the specifics of the people, parties, and events that the contract may interact with. Data obviously won't work if you need to &amp;ldquo;zoom in&amp;rdquo; or if you cannot get at the data (like the amount of potholes that currently exist in Hargeisa&amp;hellip;we are making great strides at getting at data but we still have a long way to go and even in big countries there are still zillions of data feeds which are not fully developed and leverage-able.).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="irl-paradigm-linkage-2---referees">IRL Paradigm Linkage 2 - Referees&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you do not have a data feed to rely upon, or when you need to look at the deeper specifics of people or events, then you will need some human involvement in the smart contract. I am hesitating to call these judges or arbitrators because I think the role of these humans would be slightly different in the sense that what this post is about is figuring out whether a real world event occurred or did not occur. It is a bit pedantic to say I don't like the term judges or arbitrators here, but I think that what we are looking at here is different in form and function. Really what we want the referees to look at is providing a binary answer to a relatively simple question which computers cannot answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The questions which a referee could be used would include some of the following. Did you make the web application to the correct style specification? Did the product you shipped meet the quality specifications built into the contract? These things could not easily be determined using data feeds. Did you actually plant the crops in the field that you have sought to insure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are three main considerations which I would recommend drafters build into virtual automatic contracts when utilizing referees to verify IRL events. First, the question which the referee needs to answer should be binary in nature. Second, the question which the referee needs to answer should be verifiable in nature. Third, the question which the referee needs to answer should be objective and party neutral. Let's take a look at each of these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the question should be binary. Did event Z occur? Yes or no. Sometimes this is tricky to determine and will require specialists to answer (such as does this drug meet the stated chemical specifications or does this widget meet the design specifications from this CAD drawing); sometimes, however, the question will not require specialists to answer. Whether specialists need to be involved or not will depend on the subject matter of the contract. Either way, the question which the referees need to answer should be structured so that it is binary in nature. So the contract should be structured such that the answer is yes or no, not a list or an essay which will be difficult for a computer to parse. Additionally if the question can be structured in a binary way, then experts from any language base could easily be utilized to answer the question (for the most part) and so you would have the entire world upon which to draw referees from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the question should be verifiable. Why trust one referee with determining whether an event has occurred when you could trust 3 out of 5 or 51 out of 100 or whatever threshold the parties agreed upon. If the questions could be structured in a way which the task could be uploaded to a microtasking platform such as &lt;a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon's Mechanical Turk&lt;/a> then you could easily have the questions be verified by multiple referees to ensure that one referee does not either have a bias or simply made a mistake and pressed Yes when they meant No. This would require structuring the terms of the contract in a specific way. For example, to verify that crops were planted, one could require a geotagged photo from a smart phone uploaded to the insurers site. The site could use computers to match the geotag on the photo with property records with the application for the insurance. As long as the geolocation data from those three match (within some allocable error range) then go to the next step of verifying that crops were planted. The photo which has verified its location data could then be sent to the microtasking platform with the question: Were crops planted in this field? If 3 of 5 respondents say that crops were planted there then the insurer would accept the offer from the insuree and the insurance contract would be deployed. It is up to the drafter to work with the parties to build the questions in such a way that they can be verified by multiple referees which will reduce the uncertainty and also the claims of bias by the referees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, the question should be objective. I see a lot of contracts; mostly I review contracts developed by other parties since for the most part my clients either have global templates or are Somali businesses who are given proposed contracts by larger entities. One of the things that always strikes me about many contracts is how much subjectivity is in contracts. This is fine for some types of contracts (see below) but when it &lt;em>is&lt;/em> possible to reformulate a specific verification to be objective and party neutral that would be advantageous. When I say party neutral I mean to say that whenever possible the parties should not be mentioned and the question which is sent to the referees should be focused on IRL events. So rather than ask the question like, Did party A do X? it would be advantageous to ask the question like, Did Z occur? There could be a difference in X event and Z event from the above two questions, but this will be one of the tricks in very good virtual automatic contracts and not so good virtual automatic contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="irl-paradigm-linkage-3---trust--subjective-verification">IRL Paradigm Linkage 3 - Trust || Subjective Verification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the overarching factors of the cryptocurrency space is to explicitly disallow trust. However, for many contracts trust is unavoidable. Trust and subjective verification are substantially the same thing. When I order something online I am entering a contract which has trust and subjective verification at its core. I pay the online merchant trusting that they will ship me the item and the online merchant trusts that I will not send it back to me for a stupid reason. We both subjectively verify that the two primary events have occurred (payment, and sending of the proper item).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Subjective verification and trust have one significant advantage over the above to non-trust related IRL linkages: they are efficient. It will be easy, but for the foreseeable future not an extremely simple engineering feat, to link data feeds with smart contracts or referee networks. However, it will always be easier to build a subjective verification into a contract. Yet, this will require the parties to trust one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the cryptocurrency community tends to not &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; trust so much, as a lawyer there appear to be some advantages to building subjectivity and trust into a contract. In particular, there are advantages when the parties are entering into a long term contract and where the parties &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to be able to trust one another. For example, I would likely build employment contracts for high level individuals with a trust and subjective verification clauses for some portion of the contract and then objective data feeds for other parts of the contract. In these types of contracts the parties want to be able to trust one another. The Board wants to be able to trust its officers and the officers want to be able to trust the Board. The tricky part will be determining what the conditions are which would allow the contract to trigger different clauses that are more objective in nature or would allow for a termination of the contract (which is a subject for a different post I'm working on). Obviously these triggers would be very different depending on the type of virtual automatic contract which the lawyer|coder was building, but it is likely that if you want to have a functional virtual automatic contract with some efficient elements of subjectivity within the contract that you build some triggers which one or both of the parties can utilize to turn to a more objective mechanism for determining whether an event occurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, it will not be simple to link real world events to virtual automatic contracts, but these three mechanisms would provide the basis on which to build. What am I leaving out? Are there other paradigms that you find that could work?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tomorrow I head to Addis Ababa. It has been a decent wee while since I have been to Addis and I am excited to see where the years have taken it. Ethiopia is far &amp;ndash; very far &amp;ndash; from the We are the World days; yet, that image of Ethiopia is stuck in many people's minds &amp;ndash; which is a shame because it is a beautiful, dynamic, and growing country with a lot to offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The singularity of image which Ethiopia maintains in some people's minds got me thinking about what role virtual currencies and automatic contracts could play in responding to a humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the record, I'm not a humanitarian worker. I'm a development worker. They are linked but not exactly the same albeit there is a pretty fine line betwixt the tween. Development workers stay in a country for longer periods and work on more systemic issues. Humanitarian workers largely respond to crises and in theory should stay in country for shorter periods of time and work on matters of more immediacy (get the schools open, make sure safe drinking water is available). Theoretically at least, the line is somewhere in the top 60% of Maslow's needs. If you work under that threshold you are likely a humanitarian worker, and if you work above that threshold you are likely a development worker.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="damage-assessment">Damage Assessment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first thing which humanitarians must do is to assess the damage that has been caused. It is elementary that in order to address a problem you need to know what the problem is. Damage assessment is the humanitarian version of this. I have been a long time reader of Patrick Meier and his fascinating blog &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/">iRevolution&lt;/a>. Patrick has been working with OCHA and other UN agencies (along with many others I suspect) to form a &lt;a href="http://digitalhumanitarians.com/">Digital Humanitarian Network&lt;/a> which performs microtasking and categorizing of damages so that higher agencies can have a more bi (business intelligence) view of the situation. For background on this I would suggest &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/11/11/humanitarian-technology-haiti-to-yolanda/">here on early work in Haiti and for Typhoon Yolanda&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/11/13/early-results-micromappers-yolanda/">here for an updated SitRep from Yolanda&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/11/25/combining-radio-sms-computing/">here for some thoughts on integrating SMS and machine learning&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/2014/02/17/crowd-computing-uav-imagery/">here on the role of crowd computing to analyze drone pictures&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The basic idea that Patrick and others in his tribe are working with is that the natural instinct of people to help in times of crisis should not be restricted to geography and by using advanced computing, digital imaging, and microtasking, the gigantic task of performing a damage assessment can be freed from geography, performed faster (in near real time), output more evenly damage assessments than a single human being with her|his biases would output.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="response">Response&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After a damage assessment occurs, then the onus usually falls to implementing agencies (such as Save the Children, UNICEF, Oxfam and others) to move assets into place that will provide the necessary relief. These agencies, for all their flaws, are really, really good at this. They may not be as fast as those affected by a crisis would like them to be, but all things considered they are really quite fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine the sequence of events after a major disaster. The big agency puts out a call for donations. Those donations flow in via small SMS's. Those small SMS's need to be aggregated; transfered to a large bank account in a developed country; then they need to be audited to ensure that no money came from known terrorists or money launderers; then the money needs to be transfered to a large bank account in a developing country and|or used to purchase supplies, pay staff that are deploying, provide cash for staff currently affected by the crisis themselves, etc.; then and only then can the big agency begin to distribute the money to smaller agencies in other parts of the region affected by the crisis via bank transfer; then those small agencies need to purchase supplies, pay staff that are deploying, provide cash for staff currently affected by the crisis themselves, etc.; then and only then can the small agency actually provide some help to people. This tail is long. And each step in the line takes time. One or two days for each of those steps seems reasonable. Indeed, a week seems reasonable, especially for a large wire transfer to a developing country (which can be the norm). But when you aggregate these steps you end up with a week or two or eight between when the SMSs come in to the large agency and when that agency can actually do something with the money.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-positive-roles-could-virtual-currencies-and-automatic-contracts-play">What Positive Roles Could Virtual Currencies and Automatic Contracts Play&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although the discussion above is simplistic, it is more or less how I (as a semi-outsider) understand that things work. There are a few ways in which virtual automatic contracts could be leveraged to speed up the response time of the ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing that jumps out to me is a way to provide some incentive to the MicroTakers. This &lt;em>may&lt;/em> be controversial in that perhaps they feel they are donating their time and do not expect to gain any value from the exercise, but perhaps that is not necessarily the case. Humanitarian work is a profession which requires professionals in order to do it right and those professionals do not expect to work for free their entire lives just because they &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To assist in the professionalism of the digital humanitarian microtaskers it would be trivial for an engineer to build a contract where X% of the donation stream which came in via virtual currencies was automatically reserved for the microtasker pool and then was distributed among those microtaskers according to various metrics such as the difficulty of the &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; they were &amp;ldquo;mining&amp;rdquo; (categorizing different data streams would presumably require different levels of precision and ability) or the &amp;ldquo;amount&amp;rdquo; they &amp;ldquo;mined&amp;rdquo; (the more someone contributes to the system the more they should be rewarded). In this system, the greater the overall donation pool, presumably somewhat linked to the level of the disaster and the amount of people affected and the amount of people interested in assisting those, the higher the per task reward for the digital humanitarians who are working on damage assessment from their cell phones on trains in stable parts of the world or however they are doing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system would likely take one engineer less than a week to build into the current microtasking platform that DHN already has running. Perhaps a bit longer but the investment to build this into the platform would likely be minimal vis a vis the overall cost to engineer the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A similar type of system could be build for newer, automated, machine learning portions of the damage assessment which would not require human interaction. This would be farther out, but the theory would likely be that those donating their computing power to the effort would then be rewarded for that donation somehow. This is exactly how BitCoin mining currently works, except the computing power would not be focused on securing the network (all that bitcoin miners are actually doing) but rather on performing the damage assessment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second way, and perhaps more interesting way, in which virtual automatic contracts could be used to speed up service and good delivery to affected populations is to use automatic contracts to dispense money and then let those affected spend that money in their local markets on local goods and services to a greater extent than currently happens in many developing countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's quickly compare how disaster relief works in a developed country to a developing country. When a disaster occurs in the US for example, there are big rewards for local markets to respond to that disaster (viz. Treme, and growing up in Florida). So when a disaster occurs it actually entrenches local and regional markets rather than displaces them. Ask any power worker in the South when they've been able to buy a new car and they will likely tell you that it was due to working their ass off following Hurricane Z. In developing countries however, we have a tendency to think that local markets are simply non-functional. This may or may not be true, but very often the way that humanitarian response works displaces local markets to a very large extent (for more on this read my friend &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Chaos-Decade-Out-Humanitarian/dp/0770436919">Jessica's book&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are very interesting trends in this space right now which are working on the displacement of local markets. For example, in the most recent flareup of drought in Somalia where I work there was a decentralized, diaspora led effort to send cash via money transfer and mobile money operators directly to the affected population who then used the money to purchase goods and services from local markets thereby entrenching those markets rather than displacing them. How it largely worked was small-ish organizations gathered donations in a central hub and then changed these donations into a mobile money format and dispensed it via a mobile money automater. It was wonderful to see it happen, although I'm not sure what the results of it were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The theory of virtual automatic contracts would be that they could be used &amp;ndash; especially in combination with mobile money &amp;ndash; to speed up the whole process and to increase resiliency throughout the system. If the big agencies who collect donations then had in place virtual automatic contracts with smaller agencies who in turn had virtual automatic contracts with the beneficiaries in their region, then we would be talking hours from the moment a disaster struck, to the moment that resources were in the phone of the affected populations. This would ebb and flow over time based on damage assessments which would then trigger movements of the inward resources flow to certain areas which the humans and|or robots said were of greatest need (however that was defined). Donation streams would also ebb and flow over time, but at the peak (presumably after the damage assessment system was fully deployed and operating) donations could be in people's phones within minutes of coming into the main donation wallet. Think about that. Minutes from my phone in country X to the phone of an affected person in country Y.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Auditing is extremely important for these agencies as they receive significant funding from public resources and those public agencies tend to care about such things as terrorism and money laundering. However this would be trivial if this all happened on a blockchain. All a donor would need to do is to go to &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info&lt;/a> or some other similar site to see their donation and how it flowed from their phone or computer to the big agency, to the small agency, to the beneficiary. That would work when we reach a point of adoption of virtual currency where the beneficiaries could pay for goods and services with their virtual currency. There is likely an intermediate step where either the big or the small agency would need to wholesale trade the virtual currency for mobile currency which would then be dispense to beneficiaries. The difficulty there in the medium term is that the blockchain of a virtual currency allows the donors to see with granular clarity where their money went and mobile money would not necessarily be able to do that. Of course the distributing agency could open their books, but it would not happen automatically and transparently as it does on a blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-role-would-virtual-automatic-contracts-play">What Role would Virtual Automatic Contracts Play&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the above sequence there are two primary things that negotiating virtual automatic contracts would play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, they would play the role of operating as a way for large organizations to pre-vet smaller organizations. Ideally these would take place during the normal course of business rather than when an emergency hits. By completing a contract between the big organization and small organization, the big organization will have an opportunity to perform due diligence on the small organization and to gather its virtual currency addresses, etc. so that the pipe between the large and small organizations is built and vetted so that any compliance requirements that either organization have are fulfilled. Once the pipe is built then what comes through the pipe or does not is as simple as routing currency inflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, and probably more interesting, these contracts provide an opportunity for the ecosystem within a country or region to conduct a negotiation as to what actually matters during a humanitarian crisis. In other words, how will the damage assessments be ranked and what will be the distribution of donation inflows among the various competing priorities during a humanitarian crisis. Today these are often negotiated on the fly by individual human beings (or worse, committees). But, if this negotiation happens &lt;em>before&lt;/em> the crisis then calmer, more utilitarian minds can establish priorities that will then be hard coded into the contracts and the robots would then make the distribution rather than the humans with all of their biases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those are my thoughts. What are your's?&lt;/p>

I've tried KDE and Unity. I'd like to try Elementary, but probably on an old laptop I'm going to set up for my in laws rather than my primary machine. Since about Gnome Shell 3.2, though, I've done little more than take tours around other desktop interfaces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case you did not know, one of the greatest things about Linux is that you can do this. You can explore different desktop interfaces and find the one that works for you. Gnome works for me. It may not work for you. You may prefer another flavor. That's awesome! Because Linux successfully compartmentalizes different aspects of the computer it is &lt;em>nearly&lt;/em> trivial to change desktop interfaces without having to reinstall the entire Operating System. Especially if you are using one of the major distributions to provide the underlying portions of the operating system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-extensions-i-use">The Extensions I Use&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I currently use sixteen extensions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/766/alternative-activities/">Alternate Activities Menu&lt;/a> has a nice workspace indicator. I do not really use one of its killer features which is to semi control the other extensions and to &amp;ldquo;remember&amp;rdquo; which applications are open in which workspaces (the latter because I'm anally retentive enough to always know where things are).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/">AppIndicator Support&lt;/a> is one of my favorite extensions right now. I have used some variety of this extension since shell 3.2, but this is the best in class for my (not) money. This extension does a great job of letting me customize where application indicators (tray icons, whatever they are called today) go &amp;ndash; either in the top panel or in the bottom message tray (the former I see much more often than the latter). This allows me to put things that I don't want to visually clutter my panel into the message tray where I don't really need to see them but every once in a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/768/audio-input-switcher/">Audio Input Switcher&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/751/audio-output-switcher/">Audio Output Switcher&lt;/a> are two great little tools that give me a quick way to switch what audio input | output I'm using from the system menu which is always the top right corner of the panel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/16/auto-move-windows/">Automove Windows&lt;/a> I spoke about this in my post on desktops. It does what it says and automatically moves windows to the specified workspace when you open them. It does not lock them into the workspace so you can move them around after they are opened, but it is nice to know that Spotify always opens in the Third Workspace or however you set it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/595/autohide-battery/">Autohide Battery&lt;/a> does what it says and hides the battery icon from the panel when the battery is fully charged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/">Caffeine&lt;/a> this is a great little extension which stops the screensaver and lock screen from being triggered. You can set it up to always turn on upon the occurrence of certain events. For example, I keep chromium on my system and then link Caffeine to always turn on when chromium is open. So if I want to watch videos on my computer I just use chromium rather than chrome which is my daily driver for browsing, and then I do not have to worry about the screensaver turning on. It's the little things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/111/calculator/">Calculator&lt;/a> when you press the Super (Windows) key in Gnome you go to the activities overview. This extension puts a wee little calculator there which you can use. I'm using it less and less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/97/coverflow-alt-tab/">Coverflow Alt-Tab&lt;/a> makes Alt-Tabbing beautiful in Gnome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/545/hide-top-bar/">Hide Top Bar&lt;/a> this is utterly an essential extension for me. I do not like having wasted pixels &lt;em>always&lt;/em> used at the top of my screen. If I want to see the panel I'm happy to scroll my mouse there or hit Super. Otherwise, leave me alone and let me focus on the task at hand. This is another extension which I have used various flavors of since I started using Gnome and I've resisted upgrading shells until I knew that an extension of this variety was working in the next version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/">Media Player Indicator&lt;/a> is another long-standing (for me) and very popular extension. It puts a summary of whatever media is playing (or open but not playing) into your system menu so you can control or see different things. It has always been good eye candy for the panel and in the latest version of Shell it has collapsed into the system menu which brightens that up a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/695/mediakeys-to-mpris2/">MediaKeys to MPRIS2&lt;/a> transmits my function F8 into a next song for Spotify and other apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/732/message-tray-on-bottom-right-corner/">Message Tray on bottom right corner&lt;/a> over time, Gnome has changed how you get to the message tray. I like being able to fling my mouse at the bottom right corner and having the message tray pop up rather than Super+m. This is a nice to have but not essential extension for me because I care what is going on in the message tray only a couple of times a day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/53/pomodoro/">Pomodoro&lt;/a> timer. Must have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/425/project-hamster-extension/">Project Hamster Extension&lt;/a> how I track my billable and non-billable time fluctuates over time. Have tried many different solutions and I'm here now. Not sure if will stick but have been enjoying it for about a month now. Has a good autocomplete feature and looks a hell of a lot nicer than other applications. Being designed for Gnome specifically makes it appealing as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/">User themes&lt;/a> allow me to have different themes for Gnome Shell to make it look, act, and feel different ways. I used Elegance Colors but there are tons of flavors available. This extension has been a must have since the very first version of Shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-uninstalling-enabling-disabling-extensions">Installing, Uninstalling, Enabling, Disabling Extensions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are in gnome and a user of normal variety, do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You will be much happier thereafter. Tweak tool allows you to turn extensions on or off and also lets you get to the extension preferences and options interface which you will need from time to time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, you can also get to these things from the &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/">gnome extensions web app&lt;/a> which is a brilliant tool. From there you can install, uninstall, enable, disable, and go to the preferences for any extension you have installed. It interacts with your desktop in a way which I really like, but could see how some paranoids would hate &amp;ndash; luckily because Gnome is open source those paranoids can see what information the web app is gathering from your desktop. The interface is simple and a very good way to try out different extensions to see the ones that are good for you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

Like fish farming and hydroponic vegetable growing for instance (aka aquaponics). I see some increasing levels of synergy between virtual currencies, open data schemes and international development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="virtual-currencies">Virtual Currencies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For those that do not know, virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies are an ecosystem of transmitting value similar in nature to traditional or fiat currencies (dollars, yen, yuan, pounds, euros, etc.) except with added levels of convience and security which you do not get when you want to transmit value by giving someone a piece of paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The community which uses virtual currencies is small but growing at a substantial rate, so we are far from adoption. However, one of the exciting aspects of virtual currencies for application in developing countries is the ability of anyone with any feature or smart phone to instantly conduct international transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People who follow Somalia|Somaliland will well remember that last summer there was a huge kerfuffle because Barclays indicated that it was going to revoke Dahabshiil's accounts. Dahabshiil, for those who are not Somalia watchers, is the largest money transfer and financial services provider in the Somali region. Its business model outside of Somalia is very similar in nature to Western Union's traditional money transfer system (you bring your neighborhood agent cash and they transmit it to whomever you determine). Inside of Somalia Dahabshiil acts more along the lines of a traditional bank. Most people keep their money in a Dahabshiil account rather than in cash. So the kerfuffle with Barclays would mean that people in Europe|America|Canada|Australia, wherever would have to change how they were sending money to Somalia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some this was a huge problem because they may live in a place where other options are not available. Although, since Western Union does have agents in Somalia I always felt that much of the kerfuffle was overblown. I was pleased to see the activist community successfully push for a Barclays to change their position, but the bottom line is Dahabshiil has an outdated business model and has been very conservative in pivoting from that position which opens up an innovation space for other, more nimble companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter virtual currencies. With Bitcoin, a diaspora can easily purchase Bitcoin in their home country in their home currency from either an &lt;a href="http://37coins.com">SMS transaction&lt;/a> or an online &lt;a href="http://kraken.com">bank&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://coinbase.com">transfer&lt;/a>. Once the diaspora has Bitcoin they can then easily transfer the Bitcoin to anyone in the world as long as the recipient has a Bitcoin wallet (which can be set up nearly instantly with a system like 37 Coins offers). Boom. Remittance system blockage overcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is really exciting me, though, for a development perspective is the next level of innovation that is happening with virtual currencies which will allow the building of smart contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of smart contracts, or virtual automatic contracts, is that you can build arbitrary, neutral triggers which will then be able to transmit value from one place to another when the triggers happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="open-data-as-a-neutral-indicator-of-things-happening">Open Data as a Neutral Indicator of &amp;ldquo;Things Happening&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is further exciting is that open data movements are beginning to succeed in at least getting some amount of neutral data widely available. This is beginning to be a wave with European governments showing real leadership in this space (in particular, the UK government is doing great work here).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open data with proper APIs will be able to provide smart contracts with the link between the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; and the virtual world which the contracts can see. So let's take a system like crop insurance. Within the year, a coder|lawyer could easily build a smart contract which would pay out based upon an inverse relationship to the rainfall (or other neutral, accessible data metric) in a given location.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="social-bonds-as-smart-contracts">Social Bonds as Smart Contracts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the ideas which the &lt;a href="http://www.cgdev.org">Center for Global Development&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.cgdev.org/page/development-impact-bond-working-group">others&lt;/a> are working on is the idea of a Develpment Impact Bond. &lt;a href="http://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-if-you-could-invest-development">Here&lt;/a> is a good overview by Owen Barder, and &lt;a href="http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/work/developmentimpactbonds">here&lt;/a> is another from Social Finance. The basic idea for Development Impact Bonds is that you build a bond structure which any company, organization, government, or individual can invest in and that will pay out upon certain, pre-determined metrics being hit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social Finance is in the midst of working on a pilot for this in the UK where they have asked the Ministry of Justice to commoditize how much recidivism is worth to the UK economy. So when people go back into jail that costs society and if you can put a price on that cost then you can aggregate and float that price with some level of discount to any group that says they can reduce recidivism. After that, the organization who is the recipient of the bond can then determine the best way to achieve the outcome stated by the terms of the bond. Of course there will be some implementation limits built into the bond contract but for the most part those will be increasingly fewer over time. The advantage which the bond holder will get is that it will have an asset which it can leverage in interesting ways, and use fundraise in interesting ways (as it could be used as collateral).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an idea which is intellectually appealing to me, but in practice would require a lot of human oversight. Enter smart contracts. Smart contracts could oversee the entire process automatically with no human interaction if they were properly built. This would be powerful tool for accelerating outcome based development mechanisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="smart-contracts-as-cash-on-delivery-mechanisms">Smart Contracts as Cash on Delivery Mechanisms&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another interesting and important idea which the CGD has been interested in for years is the &lt;a href="http://www.cgdev.org/initiative/cash-delivery-aid">cash on delivery&lt;/a>. COD has a lot of relevance to impact bonds but on a more decentralized basis. Here's what CGD says about COD:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cash on Delivery is a new approach to foreign aid that focuses on results, encourages innovation, and strengthens government accountability to citizens rather than donors. Under COD Aid, donors would pay for measurable and verifiable progress on specific outcomes, such as $100 dollars for every child above baseline expectations who completes primary school and takes a test.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But here's the interesting way which smart contracts could do this. With COD you have a neutral outcome based metric (kids butts in school chairs). This metric can be aggregated with an open data push and a proper API. Then you have a payout schedule which could be per day, per week, per month, per quarter, per year, whatever. The payouts are structured based upon meeting the criteria determined in the metric. Again, smart contracts could be built which would manage this with minimal human interactivity (as long as you could get the data that is).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The interesting thing which you can do with smart contracts is that it would be trivial to have payouts to a million recipients or one recipient (once you add the addresses of the recipients &amp;ndash; as is currently being piloted in many ways with mobile money). So you could structure the COD mechanism so that A portion of the money will be paid to the central government; B portion to the regional government; C portion to the local school itself; and D portion to each parent of the students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Incentives matter and behavioral economists are continuing to find new and interesting ways to structure incentive models for positive societal change. With some minimal investment into using virtual currencies and smart contracts alongside open data initiatives we will soon reach a point where to test different incentive models will require a simple change of a few lines of code, some time, and some analysis of the outcomes in R (all of this done from anywhere in the world) to determine the viability of the incentive structure to address the problem one is trying to address. Compare that to the way in which an implementing agency today would have to pivot in order to test, pilot, or scale a hypothesis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We in the development world &lt;em>should&lt;/em> know that speed and nimbleness are just as important for development workers as they are for businesses and smart contracts + open data would dramatically increase the speed at which certain things could be addressed.&lt;/p>

I thought, coming from a Windows background, that they would be overkill and require significant resources from my very old at that time laptop. My laptop then was about a 5 year old Dell that Windows Vista barely worked on. One of the huge reasons I decided to try Linux at all was the way that it was reported to be able to handle older hardware with style and grace. That said, I am always paranoid about what processes are running at any time and have for years always kept a close eye on system resource allocation (like since about Windows 3 years). Apps which are resource hogs get uninstalled or somehow sandboxed. Apps which I do not think I will need regularly get uninstalled with a vengeance. OS components I do not want get uninstalled &amp;ndash; to the extent the OS will still work if I uninstall them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coming from a Windows background, and being generally a fairly linear unitask thinker, I failed to see the benefit in multiple workspaces. I tend to keep only a few applications opened at any one time in Windows so why would I need multiple workspaces I thought. Then I installed my first version of Gnome Shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of Gnome Shell's biggest achievements as far as I'm concerned is dynamic workspaces. The basic idea is that the desktop system creates one workspace and then if you need additional ones you can either open an application in that workspace (more on this in a moment) or you can move an application to a new workspace. The desktop system will automatically create and delete workspaces based on what you are using at any one time. It is a clutter killer (which I adore) but also extraordinarily functional.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="workspaces-for-different-portions-of-the-computing-brain">Workspaces for Different Portions of the Computing Brain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have &amp;ndash; for the most part &amp;ndash; quadroned off how I interact with my computer into a quadrons.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The first quadron is my terminal workspace. I use Guake and have written about my terminal setup &lt;a href="http://coda.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/on-shells.html">here&lt;/a>. Guake is not its own workspace, as it resides &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; all my workspaces and whenever I need it, it is a simple &lt;code>F12&lt;/code> away. In this quadron is where I install, uninstall apps, generally work &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; my computer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The second quadron is my media workspace. This is generally my workspace number 3 (or my bottom workspace in Gnome's vertical configuration of workspaces). I have set up all my media players to open in this window. So from my primary workspace I simply slide down two workspaces if I want to change the album that is playing or do something that I cannot easily do from either media keys or the panel in Gnome.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The third quadron is my reference workspace. This is the workspace where I keep all the things that I need on a regular basis but do not want cluttering my primary workspace. This is the first workspace below my primary workspace. These are, for the most part, Chrome windows which I open as &lt;code>--apps&lt;/code> which allows me to open them with no decoration (which are nothing but wasted pixels if I only want to see what X site says). In this workspace I traditionally keep open four Chrome windows: &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote&lt;/a>; my Google Calendar; my Google Drive; and my &lt;a href="https://redbooth.com">Redbooth&lt;/a>. Evernote is my filing cabinet more or less and I use it for tons of different things. They have been quite public that they will not make a desktop application for Linux (which I would use relentlessly) but their web app is not bad. It used to be a resource hog but has improved (or else my new laptop is just better able to handle it). Redbooth is the Project Management Interface we use at Watershed for years now. It handles all our tasks, etc. so I need to have this open. We use Google Drive a lot for Watershed so it is helpful to see the feed rather than simply using a file browser as the feed gives me a view of what attorneys are working on quickly. With the exception of Evernote, I'm quite happy keeping these as webapps. Even when I'm in Somaliland where bandwidth is limited, all of these webapps are extremely efficient in their bandwidth usage so once they are loaded they simply Ajax call their way through the day which saves me bandwidth and also still let's me keep everything in sync.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The fourth quadron is my primary workspace. Unless I'm deep in work on a complex task requiring multiple pdf windows or something, I keep two applications running in this workspace. I keep my primary chrome window here which always has my personal and work gmails up and whatever else I happen to be reading or writing or working on in Chrome. I also keep my Sublime window open at all times. I code in Sublime, write memos in Sublime, draft contracts in Sublime, draft laws in Sublime, generally Sublime is my &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; hub for documents. If I need to open pdf or doc or odt files I generally will pull them up from Sublime rather than opening a file browser.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts-for-workspace-bliss">Keyboard Shortcuts for Workspace Bliss&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Keyboard shortcuts. Oh how I love them. So easy to setup. Go to Keyboard in your Applications menu and then click on Shortcuts. For workspace and windows stuff, go to the Navigation sub-tab. Here's the shortcuts I use:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Move window one workspace down: Alt+Super+Up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move window one workspace up: Alt+Super+Down&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move to workspace up: Ctrl+Super+Up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move to workspace down: Ctrl+Super+Down&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That's It! That is really all you need. Move a window up or down, and move your viewer up or down. While you are in here, do yourself a favour and go to Custom Shortcuts, Add a Shortcut, nautilus (as the command), Super+E (or whatever shortcut you fancy). Now you are a shortcut away from your file browser no matter where you are.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatic-workspace-management">Automatic Workspace Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I lurve automating things. With Gnome Shell it is very easy to ensure that (most) of my windows open in the specific place that I want them to. Gnome Shell extensions are lovely little applets which open up the possibilities of what you can do with your desktop. I should publish a list of the ones I use, but for now, only this &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/16/auto-move-windows/">one&lt;/a> is relevant. It is an extension which automatically moves windows to a specific workspace. That's it. So whenever I open Spotify, I have set it to open in Workspace 3. Boom! Just that simple. To set up the extensions you will need to have gnome-tweak-tool installed:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you go to the above link and push the button to install. After that open tweak and go to the Extensions tab to turn it on. You can also go to &amp;ldquo;Installed Extensions&amp;rdquo; in the gnome extensions site to turn on extensions, but generally Tweak Tool is better. Also there will be a link in Tweak Tool Extensions tab to the Extension settings. Click there. Then you will see a place to &amp;ldquo;Add rule&amp;rdquo; click there, then click the program you want and the workspace you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you prefer the old school version (as I do) then you can use dconf tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install dconf-editor
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then from dconf you go to: &lt;code>org -&amp;gt; gnome -&amp;gt; shell -&amp;gt; extensions -&amp;gt; auto-move-windows&lt;/code>. Once you get there then you type in the correct APPLICATION.desktop file and the workspace. So the string should look something like this: &lt;code>['spotify.desktop:3', 'xnoise.desktop:3']&lt;/code>. That's it. Then whenever you open the application it will open in the correct place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

My thoughts on this are quite nascent, as is the technology, but here are my early observations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Automatic virtual contracts are, essentially, small computer scripts which are linked to virtual currency wallets. The basic idea is that a financial transaction and the terms and conditions governing the transaction collapse into a singular instrument &amp;ndash; or script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example will probably make this easier to visualize. You and I want to make a contract, say, for me to deliver to you X widgets at Y time at Z price. Perhaps you don't trust that I will be able to deliver to you the widgets at the time. Perhaps I don't trust that you will be able to pay me for the widgets when I have delivered them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a traditional contract scenario, we would overcome this lack of trust in a couple of ways. Either we would put the money into an escrow account controlled &amp;ndash; likely &amp;ndash; by one of our banks. Or you would execute a Letter of Credit from your bank (which really only addresses the latter of the trust issues). Or we would just trust each other based on our reputations or our past business dealings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Virtual automatic contracts overcome the trust issues in roughly the same ways. One of the key differences is that the computers act as the intermediaries rather than a large, stable financial institution such as a bank. While it is true that many people who operate in the global marketplace do have banks, it is also true that there are significant numbers who do not have or do not want bank accounts. Virtual automatic currencies would offer these individuals (as well as the banked individuals) a mechanism to operate in the global economy just as effectively and (perhaps more) efficiently than those individuals who are banked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The analogous transaction to the escrow scenario would probably follow a sequence such as: I offer you the contract by sending you the script; you accept the contract by transferring the cost of the contract (or part of it) to a virtual currency &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; which is controlled solely by the script; we both &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; the script out into the network which verifies all of the aspects of the contract; when I deliver and you certify delivery the script automatically transfers the virtual currency to an &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; which I control from the &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; controlled solely by the script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The analogous transaction to the letter of credit scenario or to the &amp;ldquo;just trust me&amp;rdquo; scenario would probably follow a sequence such as: I offer you the contract by sending you the script; you accept the contract by placing your &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; details into a field on the script; we both &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; the script out to into the network which verifies all of the aspects of the contract; when I deliver and you certify delivery the script automatically transfers the virtual currency to an &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; which I control from your &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo;. There are a few varietals of this script which could be developed which would (1) verify you have enough currency to pay for the delivery upon the occurrence of one or more events along the trajectory of completion of the contract and (2) structure payment schemes besides a one off payment upon delivery to other schemes staggered throughout the contract's trajectory and based upon the occurrence of one or more events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond being able to have some amount of trust in complex commercial transactions for unbanked individuals, there are numerous other benefits to virtual automatic currencies which would extend to both unbanked and banked individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="speed-and-transaction-costs">Speed and Transaction Costs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Banks are slow. Escrow and letters of credit are costly. International wire transfers are slow and costly. Automatic virtual currencies would collapse this. Currently transaction costs in the bitcoin network for instance are on the order of 10%-50% of the costs for accepting credit cards. In low margin industries which have a lot of transactions this is a significant reduction in transaction costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, bitcoin transactions are fast. Even getting money into your bank from a bitcoin transaction is not very slow. Most payment providers in the developed world will give you the money to your account that evening after you have developed a history with them. If you and I were both to keep some not trivial amount of our working and operating capital in bitcoin already then the payment speed dividend increases dramatically because the real time sink in the network at this point is moving from the virtual currency (bitcoin) to a &amp;ldquo;fiat&amp;rdquo; currency and depositing that fiat currency into your bank account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those are two huge advantages. For me, the seller, I would receive the value almost instantly upon certification of the delivery by the buyer. For both of us, reducing the transaction costs (which are traditionally priced into the overall transaction and either shared between the seller and the buyer or just paid for by the buyer) will be reduced and thus the cost to the buyer for the widgets should be reduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="uncertainty-and-ambiguity">Uncertainty and Ambiguity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the things that is most promising aspects to automatic virtual contracts, but also perhaps one of the most difficult aspects in contracting generally, is their ability to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity within the contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Automatic virtual contracts are computer scripts. Computer scripts do not like ambiguity. Indeed, computers are mostly too dumb to handle ambiguity. Presumably, it will be the role of the cryptography network supporting the contract's dissemination and execution to ensure that there is a lack of ambiguity. It is unlikely that simple transactions such as the one I've been using here will have any significant level of ambiguity to the contract whether it is virtual or traditional &amp;ndash; but for other types of contracts or bylaws (think trust establishment documents or a corporation's bylaws operating as virtual automatic contracts) where ambiguity could potentially be higher this is a bigger concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reducing contractual ambiguity is usually the lawyer's job when drafting or reviewing a contract or other instrument. In a virtual automatic contract network, though, reducing ambiguity would likely be a three prong effort shared between the lawyer, the coder (who will likely be the same in coming generations), and the network. This would put more eyeballs on the problem. Also, programming is very different than drafting a contract because the computer needs precision. This will force lawyers|coders to develop contractual instruments which rely upon verification metrics for various parts of the contract which will inherently reduce its ambiguity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When it comes to scripting, the scripting language itself handles whether a comma should be in a given location or not; there is no argument over whether to include an Oxford comma in an array; there is no argument over whether a defined term is an operative method or not. The nature of computers and scripting languages reduces these typical ambiguities into a binary determination: it is, or it is not. Judges may have to learn how to read computer scripts, but it is likely that they will have less of a role in determining whether A set of words and punctuation should yield B result or C result as that will be handled by the language and the network. This will reduce ambiguity throughout the entire commercial network &amp;ndash; a very good thing if you ask any business person you know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm using uncertainty here as analogous to risk generally, or &amp;ldquo;all the other stuff surrounding the contract&amp;rdquo;. On a simple contract which I have been using as an example in this post, there will be uncertainty for me that you will not find a better price on the widgets and just send them back to me after I have delivered them; there will be uncertainty for you that I will deliver the widgets at the quality specified. Admittedly, automatic virtual contracts cannot be a panacea to address these uncertainties because there are no real strong answers here. However, a few things could be done to address them. If we know that my widgets weigh Q grams, and we have access to a postal or courier's API then we can check that I have sent Q grams * X widgets (plus some packaging weight) to you &amp;ndash; thereby reducing your uncertainty. Of course this wouldn't address the quality of the widgets. That would be nearly impossible to overcome unless we could easily agree to a level of precision that a computer could check.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One potential way to address this uncertainty is by placing some third party &amp;ldquo;referee&amp;rdquo; into the system. These people could operate similar to how insurance adjusters worked in prior economies. They would largely be independent contractors who would work for the network and could be used to certify that I have delivered X widgets to you at Y time and they meet the quality standards we agreed to in the contract. Once the referee certifies the delivery to the network, then the script would automatically execute whatever was next in the series of events (likely, paying me). Potentially in international shipping government customs investigators (married with APIs) could also have a role in such a system. The big take away here is that wherever there is a subjective determination that some event has taken place, any way to build that into an API framework or utilization of a neutral referee would work to reduce the uncertainty. This is not necessarily transformative, indeed such systems are in place today in various capacities. The biggest difference here is that the referees could work independently and be certified and paid by the network itself so they would only have an interest in ensuring the validity of the contract rather than one party or the other succeeding (or course they could always be paid off by one side to say yes or no, but we'll likely always have to live with that uncertainty).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summation">Summation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This post has examined an extremely simple contract, which is where the ecosystem will have to begin. But once the ecosystem matures a bit the possibilities here for reducing commercial transaction friction and further decentralizing while also globalizing economies is utterly fascinating. A good friend and I are working on a business proposal which would leverage these types of transactions so hopefully there will be more on the horizon to this end.&lt;/p>

It is unfortunate that we break free of our addiction to PDFs and this is the thought behind my RMOC project. Until that is a viable option for working with PDFs, here is my suite of &lt;strong>free&lt;/strong> PDF tools that can be used in the stead of the overly engineered Acrobat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reading-pdfs">Reading PDFs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most any distro will contain a PDF reader. By default Ubuntu installs Evince which is lightweight and works as a viewer. Evince still has not implemented any highlight or annotate functions, but that is OK for me since I only use PDFs to read and then copy whatever I need into Sublime Text &amp;ndash; which is where I create 99% of my documents. One of my partners likes to use Okular which has highlighting and annotating features to it. The problem is that Okular runs on KDE a different desktop environment from what I use (Gnome) and Okular does not integrate with GTK (the Gnome Toolkit for Desktop Applications) this means that installing Okular requires a ton of packages that I would never use but for within Okular. In the past I have tried it but have found that &amp;ndash; for me &amp;ndash; it is a too-much solution. Installing Okular is straightforward:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install okular
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you are all set to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="extracting-pdfs">Extracting PDFs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sometimes I prefer reading PDFs on Android with &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=udk.android.reader">ezPDF Reader&lt;/a> as its interface is nice. I generally will do this on my tablet. Then I simply save the PDF in my Dropbox which will sync to my desktop. After that, I forked a command line tool (I think from &lt;a href="http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=612">here&lt;/a>) for python which extracts the notes that I added to the document into a command line tool which I can then copy and paste into Sublime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use the extractor, you need to have a few packages installed first:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install poppler-data poppler-utils python-poppler
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you will need to paste the following script into your ~/.bin folder (or anywhere else that is in your path). I called this ~/.bin/extractpdfs but of course you can call it anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#^jist /home/coda/.bin/extractpdfs -u 8666561&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">import&lt;/span> poppler

main()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you just want to use the script as is then you can simply call the following from the command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">wget -O $FILE https://gist.github.com/compleatang/8666561/raw/79ee25d3d1a4c6f1ed7c0e9de1db951d947e3b17/extractpdfs
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What this script does is to extract the annotations into a text output on the command line. I could not figure out how to extract the highlights because of the weird way that highlighting works and because poppler is not currently set up for that. There is a ruby gem called pdf-reader that I have worked with a bit that I &lt;em>think&lt;/em> would work for extracting highlights but I have not had the time to work with it in detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The output of calling the &lt;code>extractpdfs $PDF_FILE&lt;/code> will look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>page: 24: why did she not want to go thru her records&amp;hellip;?
page: 26: make a chart detailing her claims, his payments, and the amounts she says she is borrowing?
page: 28: use this figure as illustrative for making the chart.
page: 31: fix this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ocr-ing-pdfs">OCR-ing PDFs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you get actual paper the first thing most lawyers &lt;em>should&lt;/em> do is to scan and OCR (optical character recognition &amp;ndash; or make the scan so that you can search and copy and paste the text) the document. I use gscan2pdf to do this. It is a straight forward gui application what will ocr and clean up your pdf documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install gscan2pdf
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have used a lot of the OCR gui's available for Ubuntu and for my money gscan is the best. Cleaning up PDFs and OCRing them is just a click or two away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difficulty that sometimes arises is that open source OCR technology is quite a bit behind proprietary technology. On Windows there are a couple of really good OCR technologies and on OSX there are also, but those vendors ignore Linux for the most part. Given how much I use OCR I would happily pay for a Linux native solution which is not Abby's per page basis, but I have not found one that I believe will work for me. So for now, I am left with the open source solutions. Gscan will integrate with the major OCR technologies on Linux and when you go to OCR your document you can choose which one you want to use. It will not be perfect, especially if you have a bad scane, but it will be a decent 80% solution that is 100% free.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modifying-pdfs">Modifying PDFs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Splitting PDFs, combining PDFs, deleting pages from PDFs, rearranging PDFs is most simple on Linux than it is with Adobe if you ask me. I use a great package called pdfmod which lets me do all of these things.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install pdfmod
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once you have it installed it is very straightforward to split, combine, delete pages, add pages, and rearrange pages in your PDFs. Basically the package does just what you want it to do, you can drag and drop all the pages to correctly order your PDF's; you can drag in pages from other windows; you can click on pages and press delete to remove them. It is very straight forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Working with PDFs in Linux is not 100% ideal and the programs to work with PDFs are not cohesive as you may get with Adobe in windows or osx. However, it is imminently manageable with some combination of Evince, Gscan2PDF and PdfMod you can get to almost a complete solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

This is a perennial problem. It is always easy to remember those packages you use all the time but what about those packages that you do not but you want them there when you need them. Here is a three step system for ensuring that you never forget to reinstall packages you want when you upgrade your system or reinstall you operating system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-1----build-an-install-script">Step 1 &amp;ndash; Build an Install Script&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have slowly been speaking about the parts of my installation script over the course of most of my Linux for Lawyers series. I have written about how to use &lt;a href="http://coda.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/dropbox-as-a-settings-repository.html">Dropbox as a settings repository&lt;/a> and to automatically pull those settings in when you reinstall your system and I have also written about setting up your &lt;a href="http://coda.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/on-shells.html">shell environment&lt;/a>. The system that I use depends in large part on a fairly detailed installation script that I use after installing or reinstalling a Linux operating system. So I keep my packages in that install script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My install script contains a long list of the packages which I have installed previously. This is held in an array in shell scripting format. Then the install script builds a function which is creatively called &lt;code>install_a_bunch&lt;/code>. Shell scripting is not terribly easy to follow along with, but what the function essentially does is to first check if the packages I'm trying to install are already installed. Based on the return of the sudo apt-get &amp;ndash;qq &amp;ndash;dry-run call, it parses the packages into three buckets. The first bucket contains those packages which are not installed and can be found in the repositories. The second bucket contains those packages which are already installed. The third bucket contains those packages which cannot be found in the repositories. The final thing the function does is to install those packages which are in the first bucket.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Linux package managers are decentralized things. This means that you can add and remove other package repositories besides the ones that come pre-installed with the system. In Ubuntu this is done with the add-apt-repository command. The third bucket was put in because many of the packages / programs I use are installed not from the standard repositories but from specialized repositories. In Ubuntu, many packages that are in the standard Ubuntu repositories may be a ways behind the package's latest stable release so it is often necessary to add other repositories which point to the latest stable releases rather than using the standard Ubuntu releases. For example, as of this writing, LibreOffice version 4.1.2 is what is sourced from the standard repositories while version 4.2.0 is sourced from the LibreOffice repositories. For that package and others, I will use the specialized repository rather than the standard repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-2----setup-your-shell-to-log-repositories-and-packages">Step 2 &amp;ndash; Setup Your Shell to Log Repositories and Packages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once you have an install script ready to go, then the next step is to set up your shell with shortcuts that you can use to both add a repository and install packages while also logging what you are adding into the install script.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">function&lt;/span> install&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">function&lt;/span> add-repo&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">{&lt;/span>
repos&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>$@
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">${&lt;/span>=repos&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">}&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span> echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:&lt;/span>$repos&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span> &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.installd
sudo apt-get update
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The first function above, &lt;code>install&lt;/code>, is used so that when I'm copying and pasting from a site which tells me to do a sudo apt-get install that I just can copy the install and whatever packages I'm to install. The function will do a sudo apt-get install of the packages and then will log those packages in the install script. The line after the install function is a compdef function which enables tab completion in zsh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second function above, &lt;code>add-repo&lt;/code>, is a corollary of the install function. It performs an add-apt-repository call and then logs that in the install script. Finally it performs a sudo apt-get update which you always want to do after you add a repository so that the Ubuntu list of packages gets updated with the packages from the new repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-3----keep-it-organized">Step 3 &amp;ndash; Keep It Organized&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The logging functions above will put new repositories and packages at the end of your install script (note, adding onto the end of a text file in shell is super easy with the &lt;code>echo &amp;quot;BLAH&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FILE&lt;/code> call). Then every once in a while I just organize the script. I cut and paste the repositories into the proper place in my install script and then I use ruby to organize the packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ruby installed on your computer then from shell you type &lt;code>irb&lt;/code>. This will load the interactive ruby console. After that, here is what I do (note the $ below is the cursor):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">$&lt;/span> a &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">%w(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">_CUT_AND_PASTE_THE_PACKAGES_FROM_PKGS_IN_INSTALL_SCRIPT_&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">)&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">$&lt;/span> a &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">%w(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">_CUT_AND_PASTE_THE_PACKAGES_FROM_THE_BOTTOM_OF_INSTALL_SCRIPT_&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">)&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">$&lt;/span> a&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>flatten&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>sort&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>uniq&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>join(&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&lt;/span>)
&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">$&lt;/span> exit
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then just copy the output from the final ruby call there into your packages array in the install script and delete the packages from the bottom. Then you are all set. You have all your packages logged and up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

A very intriguing concept frankly. As humans, the (relatively) neutral mechanism which we use to transfer value between humans has almost exclusively been one of the main concepts which has remained solely within the purview of sovereigns. So, what happens when currencies are no longer the purview of sovereigns? Will it work? Will it implode without the sovereignty elephant backing a currency? I have no idea, but I'm fairly optimistic that it will work. Here's why.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="currency-ecosystems">Currency Ecosystems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, as some background. Virtual currencies (not unlike &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fiat&amp;rdquo; currencies these days) exist as bits on a bunch of computers. There is no physical object which can be transfered when you need to transfer some value (pay for something). This is fairly well known by now. The most famous virtual currency, and probably the &amp;ldquo;reserve currency&amp;rdquo; of the entire ecosystem is BitCoin. If you want to understand a bit more of the background regarding virtual currencies, I definitely recommend reviewing &lt;a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/en/">this site&lt;/a> which does a good job of addressing many of the fundamental concepts in a completely approachable way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So BitCoin was the &amp;ldquo;mother&amp;rdquo; of this concept in so many respects. Of course, the creators of BitCoin relied &amp;ndash; just as we humans always do &amp;ndash; upon concepts developed earlier and in turn extended those concepts. One of the things which BitCoin did, which was necessary in order to prove its reliability to tech savvy early adopters, was to open source itself. The early adopters of BitCoin had increased certainty of the security of the code because they could see it. This was key because those who may be interested in developing an use a virtual currency will largely be those who are very particular about virtual security and other such; seeing the code is important to these people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the externalities of BitCoin opening up its system is that anyone was free to fork the code and to develop their own Coin. And people did just that. What is developing now is an entire ecosystem of AltCoins &amp;ndash; and each of which has its own &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo;. These purposes can be of value to the holders of the Coin, or not. The key to understanding this ecosystem is that currencies only have value because &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; have agreed that there is value within them. There are now currencies which store information (Datacoin), that assist with domain name registration (Namecoin), and lots of other different purposes. Of course there are such coins as Sexcoin and Potcoin. Over time, we the networks using such coins will determine what their value is via exchanges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="exchanges-to-reduce-friction">Exchanges to Reduce Friction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is developing within the AltCoin communities is a broad based ecosystem. Really it is a recursive ecosystem of ecosystems. This decentralizes much of how we think about value as different people and communities and ecosystems will value different things. It is like we are in the 1880's America when each Bank published its own notes; see &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/08/27/216125279/episode-421-the-birth-of-the-dollar-bill">here&lt;/a>. The difference between the decentralized nature of the 1880's America (and Europe at the time I suspect) is that now we have exchanges to go to that allow us to easily exchange any AltCoin listed on that exchange for BitCoin &amp;ndash; the reserve currency. This means that by quickly checking the exchange rate for the currency which someone wants to pay for something against BitCoin, anyone can easily price out their goods or services properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These exchanges are incredibly interesting because they help to reduce the overall friction within the ecosystem when I have a value proposition that I want to transfer to another person &amp;ndash; because I can store and keep my value in whatever way makes sense to me and then transfer that to another user who can exchange it for whatever value proposition makes sense given their current situation. We are still in the very very early days of this, but companies like &lt;a href="http://www.cryptsy.com">Cryptsy&lt;/a> have a &lt;em>very&lt;/em> bright future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="transactional-certainty">Transactional Certainty&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lastly, the newest AltCoins are being coded to design specific problems that we face. For instance a new Coin I'm excited about working with, &lt;a href="http://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum&lt;/a>, is building into its codebase a system of contracts. The basic idea is that a specific transaction can encode the terms of the transaction within the transaction itself. So instead of a receipt from Target which in fine print tells you that you have 30 days to return something you do not like, the transaction itself encodes this. What this allows is an entire system of transactions which previously needed arbitration to figure out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The arbitration agents of the contract are the entire network of the users of the Coin. The contracts built into Ethereum transactions will be capable of having computer precise responses to external, identifiable, quantifiable events (and I also think more subjective events but I am still trying to find to dig into the code a bit more). What are the applications of this? Tons. Option contracts jumped off the page. Escrow systems also are easy to develop. Phased delivery transactions. Pretty much the entire UCC could be coded into Ethereum and built so that when a transaction occurs it simply references back to the Digital UCC built into the code. I have a lot I want to learn about this because there are some interesting business possibilities here.

It is a great piece of kit. When you first start using Conky it can be a bit overwhelming because it has a ton of options and configuring it is not terribly straight forward for those who do not like command line and editing files. But once you get over the initial hump it is amazing. It is a set and forget tool that I have used for years with very little modification once I had my initial set up. Here is what my current setup looks like:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know what the different rings mean, but no one else does. So as a way of introduction the rings are as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Clock.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Processor load (I have an i9 processor with 8 cores so that is why there are eight half concentric rings layered into one ring).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Memory load (outside) | Battery charge (inside).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Network traffic (left side outer is outbound via ethernet, left inner is inbound via ethernet, right side outer is outbound via wireless, right side inner is inbound via wireless) | Network ports (deep inner).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drives (percent used on various drives).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/Conky">this page&lt;/a> you can see how my conky looks with other wallpapers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-conky">Setting up Conky&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In Ubuntu, Conky is in the main repositories so it is very straight forward to install:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install conky
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When the installation finishes you will be all set up. If you prefer a GUI to set up your conky with some pretty good looking initial themes, then I would encourage you to read this article over at &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/1gLQnQH">WebUPD8&lt;/a> and follow the instructions for installing conky manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I prefer to fork and modify other people's open source code and so that is what the rest of this tutorial will work towards. To get an idea of the different things that you can do with conky I would encourage you to glance at the above article first, and then go over to DeviantArt and look through the &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/1gLQJ9R">Conky galleries&lt;/a>. I originally did this but have heavily modified my theme which was originally based on &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/1gLR7Fv">work&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/1gLR8Jr">LondonAli at DeviantArt&lt;/a>. She has some beautiful conky themes she has built and her gallery is well worth pursuing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you find a theme which you like then you simply download the .zip file and extract it into your &lt;code>~/.conky&lt;/code> folder. Generally to do this, I right click on the Download link on the top of the right sidebar in DeviantArt, then Copy Link. After that, in terminal I type:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cd ~/.conky
$ wget -O conky.tgz $PASTE_LINK_WITH_CTRL_SHIFT_V
$ tar -xzvf conky.tgz
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Or, if it is a zip download&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cd ~/.conky
$ wget -O conky.zip $PASTE_LINK_WITH_CTRL_SHIFT_V
$ unzip conky
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once the files are extracted into your conky folder then you will want to cd into that directory and look at what you actually have. If all the files extracted into their own directory, I generally will move them back to the normal conky directory. Now, you are ready to start conky. I use the command line when I'm testing conky because you will be wanting to stop and restart it as you make hacks along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the command line again, the command to start conky is simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ conky -c $CONKY_RC_FILE
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then, when you want to stop it you simply type &lt;code>CTRL+C&lt;/code> when you are in your terminal. (By the by, ctrl+c in a terminal is cancel. This is why in terminal you need to type ctrl+SHIFT+c to copy something. This is a bit confusing and I've been thinking I need to change this default (which you can always do by modifying your shell config files) but haven't yet done it.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was starting with Conky, I downloaded many conky configs from DeviantArt and then started conky with one, then stopped it and started it again with another, etc. until I found the one that I liked. So when you extract the archive you downloaded from DeviantArt usually you will want to see that the different conkyrc files have different names so that you can try different ones on your desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On more sophisticated setups there are two files that conky will need, a conkyrc file which is the main file and a lua file which is used to draw cool shapes and sizes. Here is my conkyrc file. If you want to see my conky.lua file it is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/Conky/blob/master/conky.lua">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="take-your-conky-to-the-next-level-with-auto-colors">Take Your Conky to the Next Level with Auto-Colors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was interested in seeing if I could modify my conky to automatically pick colors that complement my wallpaper and I wanted it to run whenever I changed my wallpaper. This is a hack to be sure, but it works on Ubuntu at least. One of the things that Ubuntu (or Gnome, am not sure) does is when you tell it there is a new wallpaper but pick a file from a different location, it will copy that file into the ~/Wallpapers folder. I keep my wallpapers in my Dropbox so what I did was to set up a ruby process that watches the Wallpapers folder and when a new file is added, it modifies conky for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ruby file is pretty straight forward, but to use it you will have to install two gems with &lt;code>gem install listen miro&lt;/code>. After installing those gems, you are set.&lt;/p>

sleep
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Since the conky deamon watches the conky files and will reload itself when the files are modified you do not have to add a restart command to restart conky. To make this run on startup and to stay running as a deamon in the background along with conky this is what I did. Another gem to install with &lt;code>gem install foreman&lt;/code>. Then add a Procfile to the ~/.conky folder that looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">conky_main&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">usr&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>bin&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>conky &lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>c &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>coda&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>conky&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>conkyrc
&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">conky_colors&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>coda&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>conky&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>conky_colorsd
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Lastly, I added a custom startup script:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env zsh
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>source ~/.zshrc
foreman start -f /home/coda/.conky/Procfile &amp;amp;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once you add the startup script, you will need to make sure you can execute it with &lt;code>chmod +x startup.sh&lt;/code> or whatever you call it. The final step is to call the startup script when you log into your computer by adding it to your Startup Applications. After that you are all set. The startup script will start foreman, which will start normal conky with the right conkyrc that you give to it and also the conky_colorsd deamon which will watch for wallpaper changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="further-customization">Further Customization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The conky_colorsd daemon is OK. But sometimes it gets the colors wrong. Also if I used a Wallpaper from the ~/Wallpaper folder (one I've used before) or from the standard Ubuntu wallpapers, the daemon will not see those changes and will not run the modification script. So I also built a conky_colors which is executable. I symlink this into my ~/.bin folder so that I can always call &lt;code>conky_colors&lt;/code> from the command line. The process for conky_colors is roughly the same, it will look at the Wallpaper that currently is there, find its primary colors and then allow me to pick which colors I want to use for the text, ring forground and ring background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one minor hiccup in the miro gem which does not do well parsing files that have spaces in them. So sometimes when you change to a wallpaper and nothing happens, it could be because of that, running the manual script should solve that process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Voila! A completely wonderful system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="want-to-just-copy-me">Want to Just Copy Me?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No problem as long as you have ruby installed on your system. Two steps and you're set:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;code>cd ~ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git clone https://github.com/compleatang/Conky.git .conky &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gem install listen miro foreman&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add ~/.conky/startup.sh to your Startup Applications&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

My argument to others to use your shell more is simply that you &lt;strong>see&lt;/strong> what is happening with your computer a lot easier than you can with a graphical user interface (GUI). Basically, your shell is somewhat like a glass bottom boat to see what your computer is actually doing. On linux, GUI's often have an option to pull up some of what your computer is doing, but for the most part they do not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other major argument for using your shell is that once you have it set up it is fast. Damn fast. I can do so much so quickly with my shell that takes me a lot longer with a GUI. This means that I spend last time on both billable and non-billable tasks &amp;ndash; leaving more time to do other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-a-drop-down-terminal-in-ubuntu">Setting up a Drop Down Terminal in Ubuntu&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every POSIX system has a shell terminal application which you can use. But the first time you open it, it usually looks super scary &amp;ndash; as in DOS scary. The best news is that once you get over that initial shock (perhaps by following this small tutorial) it can be a very pleasant experience. In Ubuntu you can get to your shell by typing &lt;code>ctrl+alt+t&lt;/code> (for terminal). I don't like the main Gnome terminal application not because it is bad, indeed it is perfectly fine. I just prefer &lt;a href="https://github.com/Guake/guake">Guake&lt;/a> because it is a terminal which stays hidden at the &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo; of my screen completely out of sight. I start Guake on login, so it is &lt;em>always&lt;/em> available. All I have to do is to press &lt;code>F12&lt;/code> and I'm instantly in a terminal which drops down over my open program. I set Guake to take up about 45% of my screen real estate which allows me to see the rest of whatever application I need. There is a newer terminal application, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ozcanesen/terra-terminal">Terra Terminal&lt;/a>, which performs similarly in some respects but adds additional features, such as terminal splitting which I never used. Terra is still in development so after using it for a while I switched back to Guake which is more stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Installing Guake could not be more simple. Drop into a terminal and type:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install guake
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once the installation finishes, Guake will be in your applications. The next thing you will want to do is to add Guake to your startup applications. Open your applications and search for startup. When the GUI opens, click &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; then in the &amp;ldquo;Name&amp;rdquo; field type Guake and in the &amp;ldquo;Command&amp;rdquo; field type &lt;code>guake&lt;/code>. That's it. Next time you login Guake is ready for you. If you want to start guake without logging out and back in, go to your applications and search for guake and start guake terminal. Now you have your initial setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guake and Gnome Terminal (what you get when you type &lt;code>ctrl+alt+t&lt;/code>) both are simply terminals. They are like a portal to your shell program. Your shell program is distinct from you terminal program. You can use a terminal to run almost any shell program that you like. Shell programs live &amp;ldquo;below&amp;rdquo; your terminal in the stack between your eyeballs and your computer's processor. So with the same terminal, you can use different shells.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shell-programs">Shell Programs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ubuntu's default shell (and indeed many the default shell for many POSIX systems) is &lt;code>bash&lt;/code>. Bash is a good shell. Personally, I do not use it. I use &lt;code>zsh&lt;/code> mainly because its community has a ton of plugins and installation scripts which I have used to automate the installation of my luxurious shell setup. There is a long history of (ahem) discourse between the supporters of the two shells and you can google to find it. Of course, POSIX being POSIX there are numerous other options such as fish shell and other newer competitors to bash and zsh. My recommendation is to use the shell that works for you and lets you do what you need to do in the most efficient way possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ubuntu tries to keep its install wizards small so it does not install zsh by default (OSX on the other hand does I'm fairly sure), so if you want to follow the rest of this tutorial then you'll want to install zsh with the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install zsh
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When the shell is installed then you need to tell Ubuntu that this is the shell you are interested in installing. You do this with two commands. The first command finds where the zsh binary is and the second tells Ubuntu to change your shell. You copy the output from the first command (&lt;code>ctrl+shift+c&lt;/code> when you're in terminal) and paste it into the second command (&lt;code>ctrl+shift+v&lt;/code> when you're in terminal).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ which zsh
$ chsh -s $OUTPUT $USER
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In the above command $OUTPUT is the output you get from the first command and $USER is your user name on ubuntu. After that you are all set. What I do generally at this point is to close the terminal window (in Guake this is &lt;code>ctrl+shift+w&lt;/code> but that may be what I've set up to follow Chrome rather than the standard) and then open a new terminal window. Voila, you are all set up with zsh.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="making-your-shell-your-shell">Making Your Shell YOUR Shell&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now we have all the basics setup with three simple commands in the terminal. You can easily put these into your install script to automate this process whenever you install or reinstall Linux on your machine. The next step is to make the shell YOUR shell by personalizing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main file you will use to personalize the shell is your &lt;code>~/.zshrc&lt;/code>. This is the file that zsh will automatically load by default everytime a new instance of zsh is opened. You can use this file in turn to tell zsh to load other files as we will see. The reason why I like zsh is that there are a lot of plugin which you can use to make the shell your own in a very simple way. A while ago a framework for zsh was developed called &lt;a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh&lt;/a> which kicked off the frameworks in zsh in a big way. After a while this became complicated so another team developed a system which automated how this all works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use both of these systems. I use the automated install and updating system to install, remove, and update my zsh files and I use oh-my-zsh as the underlying framework (which I modify) to do much of the heavy lifting. If you want to follow along it will not be very painful I promise. The automatic installation and updater I use is called &lt;a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen">antigen&lt;/a>. Here is how you set it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen.git $LOCATION
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When you run the git clone command it will pull down antigen but you will want to put it in whatever location you like. I do not recommend putting it in &lt;code>~/.antigen&lt;/code> because when you run the script it is going to put a bunch of other files in that location and this could cause conflicts. I put it in my &lt;code>~/coding/antigen&lt;/code> folder for instance. Now, when that finished you need to edit your .zshrc file in your favorite text editor. Here's what my file looks like.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env zsh

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can read more about how to use antigen bundles on their github page linked to above, but I'll walk through it. The first thing that the file does is it &lt;code>sources&lt;/code> (which in shell means load and use) the main antigen shell script. So point this to wherever you cloned their repo to. The next line tells antigen to use the oh-my-zsh framework (there are others which you could use and the github page shows how to do that). Then there is a long list of the bundles that I want to use. Bundles are simply plugins. At the end you will see a couple of non oh-my-zsh bundles sourced. Antigen knows that when you put a bundle that looks like &lt;code>user/plugin&lt;/code> to get it from the github repo. Of course, you can not use the github defaults and you can easily point it to other bundles that you may have on a private git repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the bundles are loaded then the file tells antigen to use a specific theme. The last thing the file does is to tell zsh to load a bunch of custom files which I keep in my dropbox. That's it. The way that zsh works is that when you pass it one command and then pass it a second command that conflicts with the first then the second one always wins. This is why I source my own custom files after the framework files. This allows me to override small things that the framework does which I do not like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can look on oh-my-zsh page for a lot of different themes. Here's the theme I use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My theme tells me my username, hostname, current working directory and then tells me which rvm I'm using and how my git repo is looking (the git repo turns red if it is &amp;lsquo;dirty&amp;rsquo; or green if it is not as you can see from the different repos). If you wanted to use my theme then here is the file:&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>On my servers I do not typically install Ruby Version Manager (rvm) and the result is that this theme will throw an error which is annoying, so on my servers I use a very slightly modified theme which I would recommend if you do not use ruby a lot. One thing to note is that the colors in the server theme are bolded (this makes it easy for me to remember that I am probably ssh'ing into a server in a specific terminal and not on my computer if you did not want the bold them simply delete &amp;lsquo;_bold&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The next custom file my &lt;code>.zshrc&lt;/code> file sources is my configuration file. This is full of a bunch of defaults I've found by stalking people's dot file repos on github. To be honest there is a lot of things in this file that I do not know what they do but solve specific problems for me. I recommend using one you find from repos and then googling as different problems arise and adding or deleting the specific parts of the config file to make it yours. That is more or less what I have done over the previous few years.&lt;/p>

I also have a collateral package for installing new ppas on my computer. I have built a bunch of network functions that I use every once in a while to figure out what the heck is happening. I also have built a f-u-nsa script which I run when I get to a new country. By changing my mac address and clearing all my cookies I think I can slightly reduce my chances of being flagged within NSA's systems &amp;ndash; this is important when you run a law firm and spend lots of time in the Horn of Africa. Also I have some functions that make working with files and modifying files easier as well as a few specific functions for assisting with different programs like npm (node package manager and cabal which is haskell's package manager and I use to keep on the bleeding edge of pandoc).&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>One thing which should be mentioned is the difference between functions and aliases. There is a subtle difference between the two. Basically an alias is like a contraction. It is just a shorthand thing for a specific other command. So there is not much you can do with it AFTER the alias. If you need to pass the function a variable (like a file or a folder or a switch) then you should use a function. If you do not need to pass a variable of any time then you can use aliases if you are not trying to do something terribly complex. If there are a lot of steps to what you are trying to accomplish then a function is usually the better way to go even if it does not require any variables. Those are my two cents, am sure others may feel differently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that is it. Type a few commands, copy and paste some files and you'll be good to go with a dynamic, fast, and totally beautiful and useable shell at the push of a button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

Almost the entirety of this will also work with OSX for the record, save for program settings locations in OSX are different than in Linux &amp;ndash; they are usually in ~/Library/Application\ Settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-linux-usually-stores-settings">How Linux (Usually) Stores Settings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the most brilliant things about Linux systems is how Linux desktops (for the most part) store your application settings. On Windows, these are usually stored in databases which makes them difficult to sync and store. But on POSIX systems generally, and Linux in particular, settings for applications are largely stored in files. Indeed, usually files are simple text files rather than anything which is truly difficult to handle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two main implications for the operating system utilizing files rather than databases for application settings. The first is that you can move the files around to where &lt;strong>you&lt;/strong> want them to be rather than where the &lt;em>developers&lt;/em> think they should be and then you can fake the computer into thinking the files are really where the program is looking for them at. The second implication is that it is terribly easy to set your settings up to be cloud synced which means that you can always pull them in when you have a new machine or setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-installation-scripts">The Importance of Installation Scripts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the major things which Linux has showed me is how to create a fungible system. I use Ubuntu which is on a six month release cycle. This means that every six months or so I will completely format my hard drive and start from scratch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 90's I had a friend in college who used to format his hard drive all the time. He would take like one weekend every quarter and do this. It was ridiculous. At that time he was running Windows I'm pretty sure so I had no idea why he would do it so often. Perhaps he was not on Windows and had figured out back then what I know now which is that if you set things up correctly, formatting your hard drive and reinstalling everything can happen smoothly, resiliently and easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point when I update my Ubuntu release and format my hard drive the first thing I do after logging in is download and run one script. That script is a master script which runs all sorts of smaller scripts. It takes about an hour or maybe three to download and install everything depending on the bandwidth of my connection &amp;ndash; but even in Hargeisa where the bandwidth is awful it runs in about three hours. When it is finished, I have only a few things to do (like turn on a few extensions for Ubuntu-GNOME and maybe change my wallpaper) and my system will look and act &lt;strong>exactly&lt;/strong> as it did before the new installation. I will write more about this process later. Suffice it to say for this post that my Dropbox bootstrap script is a huge part of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-a-dropbox-bootstrap-script">Setting up a Dropbox Bootstrap Script&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Given all the above, about two years ago I realized that what I needed to do was to put all of my non-data non-music non-document non-video files that I would need to make my system look and feel the same across installations in my Dropbox. Dropbox works exceedingly well for this. In Linux most programs look for their configuration file in one of a few places.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some programs look for a file in the home folder which is usually the name of the program + rc. So for example, the program htop which is a great program for seeing the processes that are currently running and a whole lot more stores its settings in ~/.htoprc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some programs look for a set of files within ~/.config/PROGRAM_NAME/FILES.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some programs, particularly desktop (as in GNOME, Unity, Elementary, etc.) files and menus, in a various directories under ~/.local/share/STUFF.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some programs make a folder in your home directory and put files under there. Usually these are in a folder called something like ~/.PROGRAM_NAME. For example, filezilla a popular FTP program puts its configuration files under ~/.filezilla&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you do not know in Linux terms, the &lt;code>~&lt;/code> in the above is a &amp;lsquo;contraction&amp;rsquo; for &lt;code>/home/USER&lt;/code>. This is standard across POSIX systems and is a highly utilized shorthand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since programs have different methods of placing their configuration files, setting up your own cloud sync for program settings will require that you look around in your home folder. If you are doing this, it is important to understand that when a file has a &lt;code>.&lt;/code> in the beginning of it on Linux that is a hidden file and it will not show up in Nautilus unless you press &lt;code>ctrl+h&lt;/code> (for Hidden). If you are in terminal &amp;ndash; which I highly recommend everyone to learn at least the basics of &amp;ndash; then you will not see hidden files when you type &lt;code>ls&lt;/code> (LiSt files) unless you add the &lt;code>-a&lt;/code> (for All) switch to make the command &lt;code>ls -a&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key to the whole system is creating &lt;code>symlinks&lt;/code> (symbolic link) within your user folder. Symbolic links are what makes the programs &lt;em>think&lt;/em> they are looking at a file in one place when they are &lt;em>really&lt;/em> looking at a file in another location. Files which are really symlinks look, act, and feel almost exactly as if they were actually in the place where the symlink resides rather than in the place where they actually are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have found the files that you want to have synced to the cloud it is a rudimentary process to set them up. The basic flow is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Copy the files into your cloud sync folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a &lt;em>from&lt;/em> the new location in the cloud sync folder &lt;em>to&lt;/em> the previous location where the program will really look for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It is truly just that simple. If you want to symlink directories there is the added step of checking to see if a directory is made within the cloud sync folder and making the directory within the cloud sync folder if it is not. But that is the only added step. If you create a symlink directory, it operates &amp;ndash; for all intents and purposes &amp;ndash; just as a normal directory does. It has files inside of it and programs can look inside of the directory at the files just as they normally would.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-it-all-up-in-an-executable-script">Wrapping it All up in an Executable Script&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To automate this process is very straight forward. You simply want to create an executable script and put it in your cloud sync folder. Then you simply call that script whenever you like. Here is what I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ touch ~/Dropbox/bootstrap
$ chmod +x ~/Dropbox/bootstrap
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The first line creates a bootstrap file within my Dropbox folder; the second line makes it executable. At this point the file is simply blank. So then one needs to put something into the script to make it work. Here's excerpts from my bootstrap file.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env zsh

echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;All done! Dotfiles built!&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Let's walk through the script. The first line is called a shebang. It tells the computer in what scripting language the script should be run in. I chose to run this in zsh as that is my normal shell. The other major shell language, bash, could be used but there are some minor differences in the functions that would need to be worked out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most of my executable scripts, I make sure they are on Github's Gist system so that I can easily remember and retrieve them. &lt;code>jist&lt;/code> is a command line gem written in ruby that makes it easy to post, retrieve and update your Gists. I usually make a caseybang(tm) reminding myself what the code for the gist is by putting the second line as a jist line. Then I simply can copy and execute this from the command line. Largely it can be ignored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next section looks in the Dropbox folder to see if there is a Dot-Files directory. If it is not there then the script will make one. I have one there, but this is just for resiliency in the off chance that something weird happens during an upgrade. After that there are two functions which are built, file_boot and dir_boot. They do more or less what they sound like. One bootstraps individual files and one bootstraps directories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Note, in the following paragraphs the &lt;strong>first&lt;/strong> ($1 in the script) means the local or normal place on the hard drive &amp;ndash; where the program will look for the file or directory; the &lt;strong>second&lt;/strong> ($2 in the script) means the cloud sync location.]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What the function does is asks some questions. First it asks whether the first ($1) exists as a file (-f) or directory (-d) depending on whether the file_boot or dir_boot function is being called.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If it exists then the function will then ask if the first ($1) is a symlink AND whether the second ($2) exists. This usually means that I have added a file or directory to the script and it needs to bring it into my Dropbox. If this test is satisfied then the function will copy the first to the second. But if the first exists and is not a link AND the second exists then we are in a different world. This usually means that I'm reinstalling a system so we do not want to copy in the file (or directory) to the cloud sync folder as it will then overwrite my existing settings with the default settings (which is usually when this test is satisfied). After either copying over or not, depending on the test, the function will then remove the first ($1) and create a symlink from the second to the first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the first ($1) does not exist (in other words the initial test was not satisfied), but the second ($2) exists then the function will create a symlink from the second to the first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is it. It is very straight-forward. It took some massaging to get the functions correct, but once I realized the flow then it was straight-forward to create the tests and actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the script establishes the function then it simply lists the files and directories to symlink. I've put a redacted version of my complete list above to show the different locations and how I organize it. Some highlights include, autostarting settings. I keep my autostart settings in Dropbox so when I install a new system the same programs autostart. Try that in windows. Also my menus are the same across systems &amp;ndash; even for programs which I have manually placed into the desktop. Try that in windows. My desktop themes, icons, and extensions are also there so that my desktop will look and feel almost the same even when Gnome-Shell upgrades. Try that in windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I go along and add or remove programs which I want to add their settings to the dropbox folder then I simply add a new line into the appropriate section of the script by adding &lt;code>file_boot LOCAL_LOCATION SYNC_LOCATION&lt;/code> or dir_boot depending on whether it is a file or directory I'm bootstrapping. After adding the line, I save the file and then execute the script. Voila, the file is copied into my Dropbox and symlinked to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I'm installing my next update and format my harddrive, one of the first things I do in my install script is to begin downloading my dropbox. Then later in the script when it is all downloaded, I simply execute this script from the main install script which symlinks everything in and deletes the defaults which Ubuntu install wizard sets up. Voila, everything as it was before.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="improvements">Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This script could be improved by pulling out the ~/Dropbox portion into a variable and putting that variable at the top of the script for those who may use the script in a different system or have their dropbox folder in a different location. Other than that if you have improvements definitely let me know, but all in all it is quite straightforward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At any rate, hope this is somewhat useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking&lt;/p>

Everyone knows it. Even those who know very, very little about computers understand that you should back things up. But no one does. Let's talk quickly about the options which Linux has for backing up your files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud sync is not terribly new, but it has definitely been mainstreamed within the past year or two. Increasingly, bar associations have been distributing ethics opinions on how lawyers should keep their client's data safe. So far, no bar association that I know of has said outright that lawyers within their jurisdiction cannot keep their client files backed up to the cloud. I certainly know many lawyers who are skeptical about cloud backup and as a result do not do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet not using the cloud comes with a limitation, because cloud syncing is damn powerful. You have the ability to access your files from anywhere. You have the ability to very simply and quickly reconstitute your data after getting a new computer, formating an existing system, or when you are on a system which is not your main system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use three cloud syncing systems (two commercial providers and one that I have built for Watershed) and a physical external hard drive to back up my data. Everything that is important to me &amp;ndash; literally everything &amp;ndash; is put onto at least one of the proprietary cloud syncing services as well as my own, secure cloud server which I completely control, as well as my external hard drive. I have my data in different data centers, on different continents, and on different types of drives. It would take nuclear annihilation of the human species for me to lose anything more than a few file updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having your data in more than one place requires that you understand the security structure of that data. For this reason my external hard drive does not travel with me &amp;ndash; because despite my previous advice it is not encrypted. For this reason I have a highly secure server hosted within Watershed's cloud that serves to only accept our git repositories and our partner's backups. I'll get to how we structure that process in a later post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-i-structure-my-cloud-syncing-system">How I Structure My Cloud Syncing System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I use two commercial cloud sync providers, but I do not use them for the same thing. That would be a waste of the free space cloud providers offer. Personally, I use Dropbox and Google Drive. I use Dropbox as, well, a dropbox but the main way I use Dropbox is as a repository for all my configuration files. In an upcoming post, I'll walk through my Dropbox bootstrapping system, but it is very similar in nature to the system by &lt;a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup">Mackup&lt;/a>. The basic idea is that I copy folders and files into specific spots on my Dropbox and then symlink to those. I use Google Drive for all my client and internal Watershed documents. Both of my Dropbox and Google Drive are then backed up on a daily basis to Watershed's server and to my external hard drive in the office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no reason to backup one cloud provider into another either by putting one inside the other or by symlinking between them. Not only would it be a waste of valuable space, but also it &lt;em>could&lt;/em> create an infinite loop where one or both systems were constantly updating. Since both of these services at least count versions of files against your data caps, if you tried to back up one system to another you would likely have so many versions of some files that you could creep up on your data cap quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find Dropbox to be faster for smaller files and Google Drive to be faster for larger files. I have no benchmarks for this, it is simply how it feels. Which makes this distribution of effort important.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rsync----still-crazy-after-all-these-years">Rsync &amp;ndash; Still Crazy After All These Years&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Where cloud sync providers are amazing is in how fast they can update your cloud with your files. It is grand. But you don't actually always want things to be instant. Sometimes you want to go slow. When I'm in Somaliland for instance where bandwidth can be limited I do not want to necessarily take valuable bandwidth that I may need to do research or check facebook by allowing cloud sync services to update too frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why my backups to Watershed's servers and my on-site external drive are performed on a daily basis. I set my backups to run via rsync on a cron job so I never need to worry about them. What I love about posix systems is how simple they make it to build a small script and what I love about linux is how easy it is to set up a cron job to run the small scripts on whatever basis you want the script to run. These two concepts in combination with rsync makes for a completely hassle free system. If you do not have rysnc on your system then simply &lt;code>sudo apt-get install rysnc&lt;/code> or install it from your app store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I built a backupjobs script in my &lt;code>~/.bin&lt;/code> folder:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/bin/bash

&lt;span style="color:#75715e">## REDACTED&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The script is fairly straight forward. The first section of the script simply sets up defaults which I can use throughout the rest of the script. The second section then checks if Watershed's cloud server is available and if so, it rsync's the designated folders into the server. rsync has an absolute ton of options which allow it to do a great variety of things. If you want to understand what each of the switches I have set up do (switches mean the &lt;code>-rtpovclHzs --progress --delete --ignore-existing&lt;/code> portion of the script) then simply go to your terminal and type &lt;code>man rsync&lt;/code>. If you are too lazy to read all of the man page &amp;ndash; and I don't blame you because it is long and I've been working through this for a while now, then you can simply copy the switches and know that they will make a mirror online of the current state of your data. This is not a backup setup, it is a mirroring setup. The major difference between the two being if you delete something locally it will be deleted on the remote server. If that is not what you want then you would simply delete the &lt;code>--delete&lt;/code> switch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one minor gotcha with rsync. If you look at the difference between the last two rsync calls within the &lt;code>Step 2&lt;/code> section you should see a very small difference. What is different is that in the final call there is a slash at the end of the reference which does not exist in the previous one, in other words the difference is &lt;code>$BASIS/sites/&lt;/code> and &lt;code>$BASIS/Insync/caseykuhlman@watershedlegal.com&lt;/code>. To rysnc the latter means to copy the directory (and anything inside of it based on the &lt;code>-r&lt;/code> switch earlier in the command) so that there will be a &lt;code>caseykuhlman@watershedlegal.com&lt;/code> directory within the destination. To rsync the former means to copy everything inside of the directory so that there will not be a &lt;code>sites&lt;/code> folder inside the destination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last major thing that I have on the script is a notification system which sends me a &lt;a href="https://pushover.net">Pushover&lt;/a> alert whenever the script has run. Since I run the script each night, if I do not wake up to a notification then I know that it has not run. I have yet to not have that happen except for when my computer is off or I'm in transit but usually it is fine as everything will get backed up the next day. The notifications tell me whether it has backed up to the onsite external and/or the server so I quickly can tell what has happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automating-rsync-with-cron">Automating rsync with cron&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cron jobs are amazing. This will be quite quick as it is very very straight forward. The script I showed above is saved as ~/.bin/backupjobs. (Note after you save a script do not forget to make it executable by running &lt;code>chmod +x&lt;/code> on your system.) Then all I have to do is add the following line to my crontab by running &lt;code>crontab -e&lt;/code> (for edit) from my terminal&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">42&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">03&lt;/span> * * * /home/coda/.bin/backupjobs
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Cron is a bit confusing at first, but here is what is happening. The first field is the minutes, so this job is to run at 42 minutes. The second field is the hours, so this job is to run at 03 hours, or 0342. The third field is the day of the month (in other words if you wanted to run monthly jobs you would set this to run on a particular day of the month &amp;ndash; maybe the 1st or the 15th or whatever), the * in the field means every day of the month. The next field is the month of the year, so this job is to run every month of the year and every day of the month. The final field is the day of the week. So the last three fields having a * means that the script should run at 0342 every day. The final portion is simply the script that the cronjob is supposed to run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's it. Now everything is automated. I save files in my Dropbox or Google Drive or other folders during the day and at night my rsync and cron jobs back those up automatically to my onsite external and Watershed's servers. Voila. Completely automated, nuclear attack (but not nuclear annihilation) proof system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

This isn't necessarily new; indeed, it is what Marx was against; it is what communism tried to resolve; it is largely the impetus behind the late nineties anti-globalism push; and it is what Occupy was largely all about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I'm not anti-markets. They can be incredibly efficient, and democratic, means of organizing many things. The efficiencies within markets largely stem from their ability to reduce complexity to a simple proxy with which to conduct arbitrage and commerce: price. In this sense I'm referring to markets in the less restrictive (commercial) sense rather than the larger sense (which would integrate idea markets and such). The problem that I have with markets is that they can easily be captured, and the easiest path to capture a market is to restrict information flows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Farmers in the United States understand what the price &lt;em>is&lt;/em> for their crops; they can easily research trends within their profession to understand how to increase yields. Farmers in Burkina Faso largely do not (granted this is rapidly changing, but I'm only using this in service of the larger point). The difference is not only the farmers professional ability to cultivate although those may exist; the major difference is the information they receive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve Ballmer can easily predict the precise time in which he &lt;em>should&lt;/em> sell his Microsoft stock in order to avoid a major dip in price. I cannot. Again, the difference is not our relative ability to play the stock market game, but indeed it is the divergence in our information &amp;ndash; he having much more than I as to the current state of play within Microsoft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the information flows are somewhat equalized then the competition aspects of the market &amp;ndash; which are one of its highest values &amp;ndash; can be implemented. Without some level of information equalization competition simply does not exist within the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why we have insider trading regimes. This is why the internet is so terribly powerful and has so drastically disrupted the previous industrial age status quo. Under the previous status quo, big was better precisely because big allowed you to gather, analyze, and act upon lots of information. In the information age big is not necessarily better because you do not have to be big to act upon lots of information (the gathering and analyzing may happen inside or outside of your organization).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The music industry is a good icon for what the differences between industrial age markets | information and information age markets | information. Previously large labels were important because they could afford to have recruiters understand many different beats (journalistic beats, not Kanye's) as well as having lots of market research as to what was selling and what was not. This was a massive competitive advantage. Now, however, even the smallest label can easily observe different beats across the world and the spectrum of genres without leaving their computer by simply following blogs, podcasts, and having a bandcamp / soundcloud / spotify / rdio account. Small labels can also gain an understanding of the market effects of their artists with a precision that Capital Records never could have understood in the 1980's. So, as far as information, there is only minor differences between small and large labels at this point. There are differences between the two which largely reduce to the amount of marketing an entity can put behind a piece of art &amp;ndash; but with social media and online marketing reaching maturity those are also quickly collapsing (this is, however, not within the scope of what I'm speaking to with this post).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have categorized this post as &amp;ldquo;politics&amp;rdquo; for a reason. What irks me about the push from the far left and far right against and for supremacy of the markets is that they are both largely missing the point. The point is not markets themselves. Markets are simply a mechanism. I wish that we would focus our political discussions a bit more on what actually makes markets work. Although there are other things to discuss, information flows are one of the predominant factors. If we want to fix health-care, then why are we not worrying much more about information flows within the health-care market (and information's paternal cousin: actual choice)? If we want to ensure that America's place as one of the center's of innovation within the world continues then why do we continue to work against opening up information flows by engaging in reductive arguments (markets good|markets bad) while those that understand the power of information to capture and control markets continue to operate behind the scenes to close things down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course there are strides to increasing information flows. We have made absolutely astounding progress within my lifetime. And I hope that continues because we will be a better species for it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The people who most interested me were wary of centralized control, but they were not free market libertarians. They believed in the power of competition, but they also believed that some of society's most important achievements could not be incentivized with economic reward. They called themselves entrepreneurs but worked mostly in the public sector. They were equally suspicious of big government and big corporations. From a certain angle, they looked like a digital-age version of such nineteenth-century anarchists as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Mikhail Bakunin. Yet beneath that strange, hard-to-place eclecticism, a core philosophy seemed to unite all their efforts, even if it didn't fit comfortably into the existing categories of political belief.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>~ Future Perfect by Steven Johnson &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Future-Perfect-Case-Progress-Networked/dp/1594631840">Amazon&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Services are delivered by companies. But we need the government or else the greedy capitalists will take everything. But the government is inefficient and slow &amp;ndash; just look at the Post Office. But&amp;hellip; But&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dirty little secret is that no one knows necessarily what the right answer to this question is because we are still learning the right solution for a particular and the right solution is constantly changing. Instead of thinking in binary terms maybe it would be more helpful to think in terms of a spectrum with fully public delivery on the one side (passing legislation would fit here &amp;ndash; we probably do not want the rule-making function of governance to be within the private sector and even more susceptible to private capture than it currently is) and fully private delivery on the other side (selling slurpees &amp;ndash; we probably do not want selling of fungible goods to be within the private sector which has little incentives to innovate). In between these extremes there is a very large space in which operators can work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the arrangements I work in routinely for Watershed's clients are Public-Private Partnerships or PPP's. You know these from such hits as the private vendors operating services within national parks, or stadium builds which are usually a mix of public and private financing. These partnerships allow for a wide variety of delivery possibilities that are not nearly as limiting as a simple binary question of public v. private. Instead of focusing on the binary nature of service delivery within our policy debates which characterizes the delivery of services as either &lt;em>purely private&lt;/em> or &lt;em>purely public&lt;/em> each with its advocate class and all unable to resolve their differences or get things done so that people can get to the task of l i v i n, perhaps we should think more in terms of a spectrum. Focus our thinking about service delivery on a spectrum rather than a binary on-off switch allows us to focus our debates on finding the right point along the spectrum to deliver the services which we are speaking to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To Europeans this debate that occupies our time, the government is great v. government sucks debate, is hilarious. I get asked about it a lot. It is intuitive to most Europeans that service delivery operates on a spectrum. Services in Europe are routinely modified within the spectrum and also change over time due to efficiencies, politics, or many other factors. Last year there was an outcry within the UK as the conservative government was trying to move the National Health Service along the spectrum towards the private side which raised many alarms for people. But that debate, and many others within the politics of service delivery in Europe happen without the sky is falling, scream at your TV, Nancy Grace style of debate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like that part of Europe. A lot. Because generally when the population that doesn't know anything about the delivery of such services simply gets out of the way things happen in a pretty smooth way. Not all the time. But most of the time when people who don't know things about things let the people who do know things about things do their jobs things run pretty well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course there are differences between the two. Incentives for one are different. Private sector actors have incentives to optimize their profits. To think of short term gains over long term innovation. To reduce costs and simplify delivery mechanisms. These are all well and good, but there is a place for them. Public sector actors have a different set of incentives. To ensure the widest access to the services. To ensure the right costing is built into the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difference in these set of incentives (of which the above is meant to be illustrative) are important to understand. But our polity just needs to remember that there is space within these incentives for harmonization. Once we stop thinking in the simplistic terms of &amp;ldquo;Government good&amp;rdquo; | &amp;ldquo;Government bad&amp;rdquo; and start asking the question of how this service should be delivered based on what &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; are trying to accomplish. Then a whole world of policy solutions is opened to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try it during the upcoming election season. Watch a debate and ask yourself if the debaters are being overly reductive in how they are approaching a service delivery question. Those that are not being overly reductive &amp;ndash; that are in the business of finding solutions which will actually move us along a path rather than simply spewing forth banal answers &amp;ndash; those are the ones that I will be voting for.&lt;/p>

I don't need an ethics opinion from my bar association to understand that it is a bad thing to have a bunch of client stuff on an unencrypted drive that is constantly moving around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[WAIT, what're you talking about?]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK. So let us take a step back. There are a bunch of ways in which you can secure data. There are physical security measures like having a guard at your office, keeping computers in safes, chaining computers to desks and other such physical security measures. I'm not going to talk about those as they do not apply to anyone I know. I hope the data center which hosts my servers have some of them, but for most normal lawyers these are overkill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also non-physical security measures like putting a password on a file, on a directory, or on your operating system. All of these are well and good, but here is the dirty little secret that most people don't really know &amp;ndash; if someone gets access to your hard drive they can still get at a lot of that data. If someone has physical access to your hard drive then they can simply mount it onto their computer. Once your hard drive is mounted onto their system then the password from your OS and most of your other non-physical security measures are mooted by the fact that they will have root access to your hard drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easiest way to solve this problem is to encrypt your entire drive (or a partition). In Ubuntu, this is super simple. All you have to do is to tell Ubuntu to encrypt the entire drive when you are running the install script for Ubuntu. Voila. Totally encrypted drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally I use one password for the encryption unlock which is &lt;em>only&lt;/em> used for this purpose. I use a separate password for my OS login; I use neither of these passwords anywhere else on the internet. Indeed, these are the only two passwords which I really need to remember. The remainder of my passwords live in a KeePass database which in turn resides in my Dropbox account. They are all very long and very arbitrary which keeps them as secure as possible. I change them frequently and use two-step authentication everywhere I can. Yet none of that would matter if I did not have my hard drive encrypted and someone gained possession of my hard drive. Then all of my client data would be completely compromised and there is nothing I could do about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am sure that Windows and OSX have solutions for this as well. I'm also sure that neither is nearly as easy as it is on Ubuntu. Linux guys get security in a way that others don't. So whatever OS you are on, encrypt your hard drives and make sure that you can remote wipe any phones or tablets (which Android makes very easy and I'm sure iOS does as well).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking.&lt;/p>

Indeed, this has been on my mind for a while and was one of my motivating, longer term reasons for thinking that some kind of text-based &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown">legal document format&lt;/a> was necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the production of many documents, lawyers need not worry too much about what goes into repos as it is only the final version of the document which is shared publicly. That final document is likely to be a redacted .pdf so there is no need to worry about the history of the memo, filing, or whatnot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, if lawyers were to utilize git for negotiation they would need to be careful about what their commit history looked like, because opening up one's history of thinking about a document could reveal too much to another party one was seeking to contract with. Although I'm generally all for openness there is a time and a place for that, and transaction negotiation is not the time and place to necessarily be open and transparent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This piece is meant simply to think through a concept that outlines my thoughts on how a negotiation backed by git &lt;em>could&lt;/em> work. Of course, this would need to be tested to determine its feasibility, the problems and holes it may present to practitioners, etc. As a sidenote, if anyone is interested in conducting some mock negotiations on GitHub to try to identify where the sticking points are in this, I'm 100% game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scenario">Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two parties are negotiating a contractual relationship. Both parties have lawyers who understand how git works and use text-based documents to draft their contracts. In theory, this would work with Word based documents with something like &lt;a href="http://vitus.wagner.pp.ru/software/catdoc">catdoc&lt;/a> and some gitattribute &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes">magic&lt;/a>, but those are still problematic to diff and people would already use Word's track changes for worse or better.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The party initiating the contract, Party A, speaks to its lawyers who modify one of their templates to reflect the preliminary terms and parties which the Party A passes along to its lawyers. That portion is practice, but after that is when this concept begins to differ from current practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Party A's lawyers develop the Draft 0 of the proposed contract, they then open their repository for this matter to opposing counsel. When they open this repository, however, they only give allow opposing counsel to access one branch. This branch could be called &amp;ldquo;external,&amp;rdquo; but because of git defaults it is likely to be the &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch. For the purposes of this piece I will refer to the &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch as the &amp;ldquo;external&amp;rdquo; branch, but of course they could be named whatever make sense to the counsel in question. The reason for only allowing opposing counsel to see one of the two branches is to hide the internal work from opposing counsel. Another way that Party A's lawyers could do this is using a submodule, but theoretically using submodules rather than branches seems more complicated to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once Party A's lawyers open up the repository to Party B's lawyers, then Party B's lawyers make their own internal branch and perform their review. Then the negotiation takes place via a series of pull requests between the parties until the master branches of both parties have no differences. At that point, the parties have agreed on all the terms of the contract and it can be signed by the parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-prior-to-negotiation----party-a">Steps Prior to Negotiation &amp;ndash; Party A&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All of Party A's work prior to opening up the repo to Party B's lawyers should be encapsulated in a branch which will be restricted to that Party and its lawyers only and will not be opened to opposing counsel. This will keep internal discussions or changes that may reveal the Party's position in a branch which opposing counsel cannot see. Git offers (at least) three commands which could be used in this workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first command is &lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge --squash internal&lt;/code>. What this command will do is to first switch to the master branch and then merge in the work from the internal branch. The most important part of the command is the &lt;code>--squash&lt;/code> switch. When git merges the changes from the internal branch into the master branch, counsel will not want all of the commits to be shown, but what it will want is the final document (likely with comments redacted if they have been put into the document along the way) &amp;lsquo;squashed&amp;rsquo; down. Without the &lt;code>--squash&lt;/code> switch, then the merge would bring in all of the commits during the workflow. That is very unlikely to be what Party A's lawyers want to do as it will very likely reveal some positioning or other things that the counter Party's lawyers could use in their negotiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second command, and the one that I would personally start with, is &lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git rebase --interactive internal&lt;/code>. This command is a more powerful version of the &lt;code>git merge --squash&lt;/code> command. Rebasing is slightly different than merging, but for the purposes of this piece, those are largely immaterial. If you want to see a deeper discussion of rebasing, Scott Chacon's &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing">Git book&lt;/a> is the best place to start. What this command will do is to bring up an editor so that the lawyer rebasing the internal branch onto the master branch will be able to pick and choose which commits are brought into the rebase and which are not. In addition, with an interactive rebase such as this, one can also squash down the commits as with &lt;code>merge --squash&lt;/code> command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third command, and probably the least optimal command to use at this stage in the process is &lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git cherry-pick --no-commit ..internal &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick">Cherry-picking commits&lt;/a> is, to be honest, not exactly what should happen at this point. Cherry-picking commits is probably more likely to be used later in the process but it &lt;em>could&lt;/em> potentially be used at this point. Fundamentally, what the command does is to switch to the master branch and to bring in all of the changes from the internal branch which are not currently in the master branch. The key with this command is the &lt;code>--no-commit&lt;/code> switch. This tells git to apply the changes from the internal branch but to not make a commit for those (which is the default behavior). In this way, the command works very similarly to the above commands. Unlike with the merge and rebase commands, with this command the counsel merging the changes from the internal branch would have to explicitly commit on the master branch once the changes have been applied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, to summarize, here are the steps that Party A's lawyers took:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Initialize a blank repository for this matter (&lt;code>git init MATTER&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create branch &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; and switch to using that branch (&lt;code>git checkout -b internal&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drop template into internal branch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work on internal branch until satisfied.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Checkout master branch (&lt;code>git checkout master&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combine the work into one final commit within the master branch via one of the three commands above.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once the lawyers for Party A are satisfied that the Draft 0 is ready to share with the lawyers for the counter party, they simply open up the master branch of the repo to Party B's lawyers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-prior-to-negotiation----party-b">Steps Prior to Negotiation &amp;ndash; Party B&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this scenario, Party B's lawyers are simply responding to the draft contract submitted by Party A's lawyers. This is, of course, a simplified scenario to illustrate the point. In actuality, Party B and Party A could both have a starting contract they are interested in having as the basis for the final contract, but for the purposes of this exercise that adds unnecessary complexity. So let us stay with Party B simply responding to the initial draft produced by Party A.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Party A's lawyers open the repo to Party B, then Party B's lawyers will clone Party A's master branch (which is all they can see). After cloning the master branch, Party B's lawyers will immediately create their own &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; branch. They would then conduct their review of the contract based on that &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; branch. The commands used by Party B here follow the sequence above:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Clone Party A's repo (&lt;code>git clone SERVER:REPO&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an internal branch (&lt;code>git checkout -b internal&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once the parties are ready then the negotiation would begin. I can think, conceptually at least, of a couple of ways in which the negotiation could be conducted. The first way would be to conduct a negotiation by breaking the negotiation into pieces and negotiating each piece. The second way would be to conduct the negotiation as a whole. The former is probably better for complex transactions, especially when there are teams of lawyers working on different pieces of the transactions. The latter is probably better for simple negotiations where the pieces negotiation is overly complex. Let's think through these in order.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="negotiation-by-pieces">Negotiation by Pieces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once Party B has noted (via its internal branch) the areas of the Draft 0 of the contract it has objections to, it would then classify these into issues. For each of the issues Party B wishes to address within the negotiation process, it would create a new branch off of Party B master branch. This is somewhat analogous to forming a topic branch in normal git flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From each of the issue branches, Party B's lawyers could make the modifications to the contract they are interested in and send a pull request to Party A's lawyers. If the changes are agreeable to Party A, then those can be immediately merged into the master branch of both parties. Where changes require dialogue between the parties, that dialogue could happen within the comments on the web hosted repo, on email, over the phone, in person, however. In this instance, since the changes have been discreetly identified they can easily be merged into the master branch of both parties, changed by either party, or rejected as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cycle could then be repeated as many times as necessary until both parties agree. So to summarize these steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Party B: creates issue branches for each of the issues it has with the contract (&lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git checkout -b ISSUE_A&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party B: counter proposes language for each of the issues within the issue branch in question.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party B: sends pull requests to Party A for each of the issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both parties: merge the issue branch into their master branches as issues are agreed in the direction of Party B's counter proposed language (&lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge ISSUE_A &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git branch --delete ISSUE_A&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both parties: delete the issue branch from both repos as issues are agreed in the direction of Party A's originally proposed language (&lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git branch --delete ISSUE_A&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both parties: work from the issue branch as the language goes back and forth (&lt;code>git checkout ISSUE_A&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rinse and repeat as necessary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>When all of the topic branches have been merged into both masters or deleted without merging, then the negotiation is complete. Both parties should do a quick diff of the masters to ensure that there are no discrepancies. Thereafter the contract is ready for signature and execution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="negotiation-by-cycles">Negotiation by Cycles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once Party B has noted (via its internal branch) the areas of the Draft 0 of the contract it has objects to, and it has refactored those provisions into its counter-proposed language, it would then &lt;code>git merge --squash&lt;/code>, &lt;code>git rebase --interactive&lt;/code>, or &lt;code>git cherry-pick --no-commit&lt;/code> those changes into its master branch. Once it has brought in its changes wholesale, it would send a pull request for the entire master branch to Party A.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thereafter Party A would work up its counterproposal via its internal branch after merging in the changes from Party B's master to Party A's internal. When it was ready with a counterproposal it would &lt;code>git merge --squash&lt;/code>, &lt;code>git rebase --interactive&lt;/code>, or &lt;code>git cherry-pick --no-commit&lt;/code> those changes into its master branch and send a pull request to Party B.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cycle would then continue until both parties were satisfied. So to summarize these steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Party B: works on its counter proposal via its internal branch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party B: brings in the changes to its master branch and sends pull request.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party A: merges Party B's master into its internal branch (&lt;code>git checkout internal &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge SERVER:REPO master&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party A: works on its changes and brings those into its master via one of the three reductive commands above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rinse and repeat as necessary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>When both of the parties have no further changes to the text, then the negotiation is complete. As with the prior methodology, both parties should perform a diff of the two masters to ensure that there are no discrepancies before the contract is fully ready for signature and execution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The advantage of the negotiation by cycles workflow is that there is less branching and moving pieces to worry about. Indeed it is rather similar to how negotiations are conducted at present but with an overlay of git which will retain all of the internal work as well as the communication between the clients (which to be fair both methodologies will do). The advantage of the negotiation by pieces workflow, though is that proposals and counterproposals which may contain numerous discrete issues to be addressed within a complex negotiation, are not separated out into pieces as they are in the previous negotiation workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, when the parties have agreed to the substance of the contract, the lawyers for both parties can produce two distinct pieces of work. The first is the final contract which will be signed and executed as required for the jurisdiction in which it is being performed. The second would be an internal archive of the entire repo. This archive provides the &amp;ldquo;legislative history&amp;rdquo; of the contract and could illuminate some of the parties&amp;rsquo; intent if the contract were ever to be litigated. Of course, the admission of the repo archive would be subject to the rules of evidence at the time one of the parties sought to have it admitted, but that would be a discussion for another time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

Not on many, but on a few. Oh, and my wife is an amalgamated character in the book.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chasing Chaos examines the lives that aid workers lead and the work which aid workers do in vivid clarity and with honesty, clarity, and warmth. Highly recommended book; and not only because I know Jess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When someone says they work for a law firm, most people who are not lawyers have certain cultural benchmarks in which to orient themselves around some idea of what that lawyer's life may be like. Whether it is because the non-lawyer was an English major and read One L as they considered law school, because they watched L.A. Law, Ally McBeal, Boston Legal, or Suits, or because they have watched Erin Brokovitch or any of Grisham's books/movies &amp;ndash; no matter the case, most are able to comprehend to a certain degree what the lawyer's life is like. Sure cultural benchmarks are subject to Hollywood mandated arbitrary drama which often fails to portray the fuller reality of its subject matter. But at least these benchmarks provide an icon in which to begin discourse. Similarly, when someone says they are a doctor, people can refer to the cultural benchmarks of ER or Grey's Anatomy or Scrubs. Finance? Wall Street, and any of the recent movies which came out after the 2008 crash. Firefighters. Policeman. Nurses. Teachers. These are all easy to talk about when meeting people because icons from popular culture provide an entry point to begin communicating what one &amp;ldquo;does&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those of us who live the life which I live do not have such a luxury. The aid and development businesses are foreign to many folks not only because of the &amp;ldquo;exotic&amp;rdquo; locations in which aid and development take place, but because the work that aid and development workers do is not fully understood within mainstream Western culture. It is certainly well understood in mainstream Asian, African, and Latin American cultures as they have lived through, or are living through, the arc of how modern aid and development works. Chasing Chaos is a book which explains the life that I live &amp;ndash; with all its contradictions, tensions, nuances, stresses, pleasures, and excitement &amp;ndash; much better than I ever could.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Jess asked me if I would read an early copy of the book, I told her I was happy to and that her publisher should send a copy to our temporary apartment in Nairobi which we are so rarely at, that the caretaker called Leigh the other day to ask if we were still living there; both of us recently have been &amp;ldquo;on mission&amp;rdquo; a lot. Exotic Apartments, Ngong Road (Across from Nairobi Baptist Church), Nairobi, Kenya is the address I facebook messaged to Jess. At the time I thought, if her publishers wondered whether she was going to go all A Million Little Pieces on them, perhaps sending early review copies to the above address may make them more comfortable as to her credence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jess does not have the most field cred of any one I've ever met. Yet she has certainly done some hard time. One of the most refreshing things about the book, and one of its most worthwhile aspects is that Jess is honest about that fact, as well as everything else. While the book is peppered with hilarious anecdotes &amp;ndash; Jess being at the farther end of the funny people bell curve on the storytelling front &amp;ndash; its is also salted with tears. Honest, genuine, heartfelt tears. This life and this work that aid and development workers embark upon so often oscillates wildly between stomach bursting laughter and shoulder seizing weeping &amp;ndash; Chasing Chaos captures these oscillations, and the doldrums in between the ends of the spectrum, perfectly. It illustrates how it feels to be exhausted, filthy, drenched in sweat, and have to deal with yet another problem that you did not anticipate. It also illustrates the joy which very few have an opportunity to understand, the joy of how even small victories feel when achieved despite obscene obstacles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps my favorite aspect of the book is that Jess never loses sight of the humanity of this business. Fundamentally humanitarian aid and development are about helping people. It is certainly an imperfect industry. Of course for those of us in this industry it is easy to get more hung up on the fact that we cannot go to Starbucks on our way to work and spend more time focusing our mental energies on our personal deprivations than on the people we are supposedly helping. Between the outwardly selfless actions we are supposed to be performing and the (at times) inwardly selfish motivations which drive us to take those actions it becomes very easy for us to lose sight of the human beings around us &amp;ndash; whether those are national colleagues not entitled to evacuation if it all goes south, or the beneficiaries who are so often not given a voice in the matter at all. What Jess is able to accomplish in her memoir is to examine both sides of the outwardly selfless and inwardly selfish equation without losing her focus on the people she has met along her own journey. Everyone in the book, no matter where they come from, their class or stature or background, is treated as an individual, unique human being. In the haze of travel and constantly changing environments, in the blur of the mountains of work we very often face, this is a difficult challenge even for the most altruistic of aid workers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Jess is tracing her own career development, during the latter portions of the book, the narrative turns to a more reflective examination of the aid business. Her examination of the contradictions and tensions underlying the work, I suspect, will resonate with many. These are the things which we talk about at expat parties and other gatherings of those of us who live &amp;ldquo;The Life&amp;rdquo; whether in New York, Geneva, London, the Hague, Nairobi, Monrovia, Colombo, Khartoum, Aceh, Kabul, Bratislava, or Mogadishu. Like other groups of professionals, when we gather we are bound to talk about work. She illustrates clearly many of the things that have been, and are, wrong with and many things that are right about the aid business in language which those who have not attended such an expat party and participated in such discussions can easily understand. The book does a fine job of using the human elements of its narrative to illustrate her larger perspective as to where aid is at this particular moment in time. Her points, while not unfamiliar to most in the business, are easily approachable to those who are not &lt;em>in&lt;/em> the business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chasing Chaos is a book which provides a holistic view of our world, our jobs, and our lives. If you are currently living &amp;ldquo;The Life&amp;rdquo; you should read this book for the stories &amp;ndash; which I am positive will resonate deeply with your own experiences and journey. If you are thinking about getting into &amp;ldquo;The Life&amp;rdquo; then you should certainly read this book as it provides the best glimpse I have read as to what this is like. If you have loved ones or friends in &amp;ldquo;The Life&amp;rdquo; you should very much read this book as it will explain in a way that perhaps your loved one or friend cannot what their life is like: what they think about, how they feel, and what they actually do. Personally, I have never given my mother or father any book in this genre, until now.&lt;/p>

Mostly the changes should be transparent to users. Now that I feel that am getting a better handle on Ruby, I wanted to refactor the code quite a bit. There were a couple of motivations for this. First, I wanted to put the code more inline with common rubyisms and software construction methods. Second, I wanted to make the gem more flexible. It was fairly straightforward as previously conceived. There was only one class, no modules, and all the functionality resided in one huge file. Third, speed. Although most lmd files will be quite tiny and any modern computer can parse them and refactor them into md files within milliseconds, faster is always &amp;gt; slower.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="refactor-into-multiple-modules-and-classes">Refactor into Multiple Modules and Classes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I started the refactor by building two modules. First there is the main LegalMarkdown module which operates as the overall wrapper for the system. I wanted it to be a module so that other code (predominantly &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/rmoc">RMOC&lt;/a>, which is upcoming once I release legal_markdown 1.0) can pull in the gem functionality in a more efficient and modular way. The LegalMarkdown module has a simple controller to direct the actions of the gem. For now it is fairly rudimentary, one of my next steps will be to utilize Ruby's OptionsParser now that the functionality of the gem is becoming more complicated. So the module operates as the parent of the gem, and has one method which controls what the gem does when the module is called. For now there are two modules which live directly &amp;ldquo;under&amp;rdquo; LegalMarkdown. The first module automatically builds the YAML front matter for users. This functionality has existed since v0.1.4 and I have to refactor that code in the coming times. The second module abstracted the LegalToMarkdown functionality into its own module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly with the top level module, I abstracted LegalToMarkdown a bit. The entry point to the module is a controller file which determines how the module will perform. The file contains two methods. One of which controls the lmd -&amp;gt; md functionality and another which controls the lmd -&amp;gt; json functionality. There is probably too much logic in this file right now and I likely should abstract some of it to the LegalMarkdown controller which sets everything up to run a parsing incident more efficiently, but it is still a work in progress. To run the parsing incident I abstracted out the previous gem functionality into a couple of other files based on the steps required to parse a file. This is, perhaps, not optimal, but it is what makes sense to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step to any parsing incident is to load and parse the input file. This content is an &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; in ruby so it made sense that the content to be parse would be put in a class. When I call Class.new, Ruby will load the file, parse it, integrate the proper submodules of LegalToMarkdown module and get everything &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo; for the LegalToMarkdown controller to run the remainder of the parsing incident. Again, I'm not sure if this optimal software design as I'm still learning, but it seems to make sense to my and I can &amp;ldquo;visualize&amp;rdquo; where everything is at any point in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of the process I abstracted into modules under LegalToMarkdown so that they can be integrated on a case by case basis depending on what the file needs to actually do. For instance if the file does not have a leaders block then there is no need to run that code. Similarly if the file does not have any mixins or optional clauses there is no need to run that code. It took me a while to figure out how to properly pull in the modules based on the conditions of the content. I still don't feel that I fully understand &lt;code>extend self&lt;/code> and &lt;code>self.extend&lt;/code> and &lt;code>include Module&lt;/code> but in any event, when extending a class with a module what ended up working based on the new design was to call &lt;code>self.extend LegalToMarkdown::Module&lt;/code> from a method in the class which parses the conditions to determine the correct modules to integrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The portion of the code dealing with mixins was integrated into its own Module under the LegalToMarkdown module. Similarly the methods which parse leaders (structured headers) has been put into a different module under the LegalToMarkdown module. The last module I built deals with some particularities required for the &lt;code>--to-json&lt;/code> feature. So at the end of the day, the structure of the gem currently looks like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>module LegalMarkdown&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt; module LegalToMarkdown&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt; -&amp;gt; class FileToParse&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt; module Mixin&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt; module Leaders&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt; module BuildJason&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt; module MakeYAMLFrontmatter&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Again, feedback on the structure is very much welcome as I'm still learning how to think about software design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="testing-suite">Testing Suite&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I know, I know. You are supposed to have tests for what you do. How else will you know if it is working or not? I'm still learning! In any event, I took some time to build a testing suite. It was actually quite easy. And it greatly simplifies the development process. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://github.com/twolfson">@twolfson&lt;/a> posted an issue on the github repo which sent me in the correct direction. He said I should build a bunch of simple flat files that represent the input and expected output. This is more or less what I had been doing, although I was not doing it systematically and was just doing it chaotically. Everything I read said that I should start out with testing using Ruby's included test suite rather than RSpec or other more intricate, and capable, test possibilities. So that is currently the basis for the suite. Later, when I'm more comfortable with the process I may switch to RSpec but for now Test::Unit is working just fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the things that was important with a process oriented gem like legal_markdown is that when I test things there is a certain sequence in which I want the tests to run. So when I built the lmd files I simply numbered them. Then in the test controller I can simply glob the files, sort the resulting array and then it will always run the tests in a particular order that I want the files to be parsed. This allows me to check the operation of the gem in a particular sequence. That assists in understanding exactly where the problems. After building the lmd files then I ran those through the gem and tweaked a few things in the output markdown files (mostly which were bugs that I needed to work on). Boom, I had a working test suite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The basic philosophy for testing is to build these benchmark files. Then the test suite pulls the lmd files, puts them in order, then runs them one by one through the gem and outputs a temp file. Lastly, the test suite compares the temp file output to the benchmark file to ensure they are the same. Later when I add additional functionality or need to test different things, I can simply build a single lmd file that tests for what I need, output that to a md file as a benchmark, number it in the correct order in which I want the test to run and everything else will be taken care of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I had the test suite built. Then I had to work on the Rakefile to build the testing task. I integrated the github repo with &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis&lt;/a> so that it will perform the tests for me on different versions of ruby. Generally I can test the gem quite quickly in 1.9.3 which is primarily what I use for development on my laptop. I run these tests after each piece of code after each piece of code that I've changed during the deeper refactor (below). The advantage of Travis is that it will run the tests on other versions of Ruby very quickly. But to use Travis, and to make running the tests more simple on my machine, I needed to build a rake task that would control the tests. It was very easy after a bit of googling and stack overflowing I had the answer within five minutes. I need to understand how to use rake better, but one thing at a time. For now, here's what the Rakefile looks like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">require &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">bundler/gem_tasks&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
require &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;rake/testtask&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">Rake&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">::&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">TestTask&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>new &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>t&lt;span style="color:#f92672">|&lt;/span>
t&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>libs &lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">test&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
t&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>test_files &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">FileList&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;test/test*.rb&amp;#39;&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
t&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>verbose &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">true&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
task &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">:default&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&amp;gt;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">:test&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It is very rudimentary for most, but it was cool for me to be able to type &lt;code>rake&lt;/code> into the command line (or if I was feeling verbose &lt;code>bundle exec rake&lt;/code>) and have it run the tests. Plus now Travis runs all the tests on the versions of Ruby which I specify in the .travis.yml file.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="deeper-refactoring">Deeper Refactoring&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Along with Travis, I also integrated the repo with &lt;a href="https://codeclimate.com">Code Climate&lt;/a>. Both of these tools are free for open source projects and make their money (as Github does) by providing the same, or similar, services for closed source project. I absolutely love this business model. Code Climate looks at your code and analyzes the complexity and redundancy of the code basis. Digging into its analysis of my code basis is teaching me a lot about coding and how to think about coding. For anyone that is reaching the advanced beginner stage of learning to code this is a fantastic tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first integrated with Code Climate it gave me a rounding &amp;ldquo;F&amp;rdquo; and my GPA was 0.2. This was eye opening. It was one of the impetuses for my major refactor discussed above. After I parsed everything out into modules, etc. I also had to take a look at the methods and simplify those. Previously I had been thinking of methods as a way to control the flow of the code. So each of logical steps and substeps of the code were built as methods. It worked. But it is suboptimal for reasons I'm still learning. The basic jist is that I needed to greatly simplify what I was doing with my methods. So, mainly in the Leaders module I worked hard to refactor the code so that each method was more simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, though, the code base is quite complex. I'm up to a GPA of 1.5 but I have a decent amount of work to do. Some of the complexity it appears to me is inevitable. There are a ton of complexities in what the gem is trying to do. There are ton of switches and branches depending on what the input is. In order to provide the functionality that I want, I'm still trying to figure out how to simplify the code base as much as possible. There appears a tension in what I'm trying to accomplish with the gem and the complexity of the codebase. However, this is hardly the most complex piece of code ever written. Much to learn; much to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="to-json-feature">To Json Feature&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some background. I started building legal_markdown because I wanted it to be a simple tool that could provide a basis for a new way of thinking about and creating legal documents. Yet, how to integrate with a ruby gem for non-technical, non-command line users, was a big concern. The average lawyer likely has never looked at the command line. Or at least, not since 1986. So it is fine that I have built in a command line option, but that is only the beginning. The next step was to integrate the gem into a sublime package. I use this package on a daily basis and it makes using the gem dead simple. Users can install sublime, install Package control, install the legal markdown package and go. Still there is the ruby requirement, but at least that is a surmountable obstacle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with working with lmd files in sublime is primarily that it is not a very elegant solution for reading and annotating documents. Currently if I want to read a lmd file, it is damn easy. I simply run the Legal Markdown to Markdown command in sublime and then run the Preview Markdown command from the Markdown Preview package and it opens automatically in the browser. Two commands. It is not bad, but it could be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are some of the concerns behind &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/rmoc">RMOC&lt;/a>. To read and annotate files will require a more complex structure than simple markdown is capable of providing. There are a couple of options for richer file formats than simple text based format such as markdown. For now, the primary &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; format that legal_markdown will support is JSON. As I stated in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown/issues/2">issue&lt;/a> , JSON is readily available for all major programming/scripting languages; generally parses faster and is easier to work with than xml (the other major option); and also integrates with databases very well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, I've been a fan for a while of what the team building &lt;a href="http://substance.io">Substance&lt;/a> is doing. So, I've built the to-json feature of legal_markdown so that it outputs in a format which will fully integrate with Substance. Then when I build the Read component of RMOC I can simply use a lot of their code to build the reading and annotating portion of RMOC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building the feature was not really troublesome. Once you have a good idea of how to work with hashes in ruby then it is really a simple matter to build JSON documents. You simply assemble the code into one large hash and then dump that hash into a JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Classes = things. Files are things. A file is a Class. Functionality goes in modules&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modules are ways to keep blocks of code so that they can be integrated when necessary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Methods should have a singular function&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nested hashes area bit troublesome when the keys are id's and you only know the values rather than the keys. Have to loop through each_value and work the search that way. Also, Enumerable::detect is good for this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don't be afraid of tests. They aren't that complex.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As part of my work for &lt;a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt Law School&lt;/a>&amp;lsquo;s &lt;a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/academics/academic-programs/international-legal-studies/index.aspx">International Legal Studies Program&lt;/a> I recently pushed a grant application to a US Government Agency that was all about increasing the capacity of an institution to perform its mandated functionality. It was a relatively straight-forward submission &amp;ndash; the safest I've been involved in lately as it had the least amount of innovation I have built into a submission in years. For these reasons, I feel we have a relatively high chance of success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The part I like least when it comes to developing grant applications is the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) portion of the grant response. It is not because I feel that M&amp;amp;E is worthless. Indeed, the contrary is true. I fully buy into the notion that development programs must &lt;em>monitor&lt;/em> their implementation based on measurable metrics. Further, I fully buy into the idea that development programming is simply a means that is an attempt to achieve some (other) identifiable end and I fully buy into the idea that we should develop a theory for how the programming will lead to the desired results portfolio and we should &lt;em>evaluate&lt;/em> the project based on those outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite intellectually understanding the need for and efficacy of M&amp;amp;E, I detest writing M&amp;amp;E frameworks. Mostly, I suspect this is due to the sector I work in. If I worked in education, health, agriculture, or some other sectors of the development world perhaps M&amp;amp;E would be less of a motivational hurdle for me; perhaps not, to be honest I have no idea. There are two reasons why I think this could be true. First, these sectors can more easily be measured. Second, these sectors present programs with a quicker ROI where success or failure of the program can more easily be measured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we can all agree that the ability to measure success is one of the more important elements to the design of any M&amp;amp;E framework, then we need to (as practitioners) build M&amp;amp;E frameworks that can be measured. Duh. Yet, if the goal is to &amp;ldquo;build institution X&amp;rdquo; or to &amp;ldquo;build the capacity of policymakers within area Y&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;provide technical support to the reform of policy sector Z&amp;rdquo; how can we craft metrics which are easily measured? Governance work (which I am referring to in isolation from democracy &amp;amp; governance work) usually boils down to one of those three goals. Either the donor and the beneficiary government want an institution to be built, want the capacity of the individuals comprising an institution to be bolstered, or want to achieve a longer-term legal or policy reform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we look at measuring the implementation and the success of any development programming (I'm not a fan of the intervention jargon with respect to governance work), there are basically two ways in which we can measure things. We can measure &lt;em>what has been done&lt;/em>. These are commonly called &lt;strong>output variables&lt;/strong>. Examples of output measurement: How many memos were written and given to policymakers? How many schools were built? How many police units were outfitted with advanced investigation kit? Output variables commonly measure things that are usually well within the control of the implementing agency or consortium. We can also measure &lt;em>what has happened&lt;/em>. These are commonly called &lt;strong>outcome variables&lt;/strong>. Examples of outcome measurement: How much better is the institution performing? How many more students are graduating from the impact area? How many few crimes were committed within the impact area? Outcome variables commonly measure things that are not so easily within the control of the implementing agency or consortium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between the two (output and outcome) it is more beneficial to the implementing agency or consortium to measure the outputs. The implementer can more easily control the output as the delivery of the output is usually well within the decision space of the implementer. It is self-evident that no implementer wants to show that they did not deliver on a project when the delivery on that project was a result of things outside their control. Most humans would find it within the realm of normality to have their performance evaluated based upon what they actually did. Output variables are simply a measurement of what the implementer has done, and therefore easier to measure and also easier to say, &amp;ldquo;evaluate me on &lt;em>this&lt;/em>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between the two (output and outcome), however, it is more beneficial to the environment in which the program is being implemented to measure the outcomes. Outcome variables are a method which more precisely measures the &lt;strong>results&lt;/strong> of the program that was implemented. The overarching mission of what we, as development workers, should be doing is to produce results that positively affect the environment. While purchasing advanced investigation kit for police units and training personnel on that kit's usage is important that is not necessarily a result (it is an output). That purchase and training effort will not, of itself, positively affect the environment. However, if the police are empowered to use the kit and training to reduce crime within the impact area, then we are looking at a result that positively affects the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While they may be more beneficial to build into M&amp;amp;E frameworks, it is often not a simple matter to measure outcomes &amp;ndash; particularly when we are talking about building and/or reforming institutions. The real problem that I often face when I am trying to think through building an M&amp;amp;E framework is the same reason why, psychologically, governance work can be wholly unsatisfying for those who dedicate their professional lives to it. I am sure that social scientists and development thinkers with more brains and experience than I have some lingo for it, but I just call it the &amp;ldquo;gratification delay.&amp;rdquo; When the effort you are embarking upon is about transmitting knowledge, it will take time for you to see the results of that effort. This is self-evident and we all see it in our every day lives. If we are talking about building an institution we are talking about transmitting knowledge in how to run that institution much more than we are talking about building some physical structure, and so we are facing a situation where the real gratification for the effort cannot be measured until some non-specific time in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gets me to the biggest problem I have with the evaluation portion of any M&amp;amp;E framework. It is not that it is difficult to build the framework, it is that is exceptionally short sited of donors to require implementing agencies to evaluate the project within the timeframe of the project. So in other words it is simply a paper tiger. It wreaks to me of work for work's sake, rather than work that will end with the satisfaction of some logical goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For my own purposes, I would love if a donor said that I should submit a grant application and build an M&amp;amp;E framework into that submission but that my &amp;amp;E portion will be conducted by another organization at some reasonable time following the conclusion of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost every project that I have seen or been a part of is behind from the beginning and is rushing towards the end to deliver on its promises. Even where those projects have built the final quarter of the project as M&amp;amp;E time to properly evaluate the project, the best they can do within that timeframe is simply to get a very early picture of the results. So why do donors not simply extend out the &amp;amp;E part to four, six, eight quarters following the completion of the project? I am sure there are reasons, but I surely do not know what they are.&lt;/p>

Lexie is my friends&amp;rsquo; daughter and she is lovely. She had to do a Flat Stanley project but she named it Flat Lexie instead. So they sent me a Flat Lexie and we basically travelled the world together &amp;ndash; flat lexie and I. We had a few adventures so I wanted to try to capture the pictures I took but also to capture the geography and background of the different places. Indeed, this is supposed to be the point of the Flat Stanley/Flat Lexie exercises for kids to know about the world. In any event, &lt;a href="http://flatlexie.caseykuhlman.com">here&lt;/a> is the result; &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/flat-lexie">here&lt;/a> is the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a simple Sinatra app (first for me), running on Heroku (another first for me), which integrates the &lt;a href="https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps">gMaps&lt;/a> package I installed with Bower (first, first), and a bit of jQuery I added along the way to tie everything together (not a first).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What did I learn?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I like Ruby.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I'm not sure I like javascript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At a minimum, I'm pretty awful at javascript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In any event I'm more comfortable with Ruby.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sinatra is smooth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heroku is smooth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I still have to figure out how to pass JSON data to javascript run views from Ruby controllers that doesn't rely on data attributes &amp;ndash; as that feels like such a patch.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how">How&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The chunk that took me the biggest portion of time was building the javascript file that would tie gMaps, jQuery and the view together. I built the view so it would preload all of the images in boxes that I wanted to slideToggle the display of in sequence. This was straight-forward jQuery, nothing special there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I wanted the map which comprises a 100%x100% background to move around zoom in and zoom out on certain events. Basically I wanted the map to start zoomed out, so that Lexie could see the context, and then after waiting a few seconds I wanted to zoom in to the pinpoint location. When moving to the next picture in the series I wanted the sequence to run like this: slideToggle the old picture/entry, I wanted the map to zoom out to a preestablished zoom level (which depended on how &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; the transition was), then I wanted to put a marker in the new location, then I wanted the map to slide its center over to the new location. It turned out to be not that difficult. gMaps is a great API wrapper for Google Maps API. Between gMaps and jQuery it wasn't that difficult to craft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still I have some issues with javascript. My issues aren't with javascript per se, as in they are the language's problem, they are my problem in that I don't really know how to use the language properly yet. I still don't fully understand how to call functions and functions as extensable objects is still quite confusing to me and also variable scope is killing me. Both of these Ruby is much more straight-forward about (or else I've read more about and understand better). So if anyone wants to point out the innumerable flaws and less than optimal code in the javascript below I'm happy to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any event, my script that tied the whole thing together and made Flat Lexie works.&lt;/p>

The package is built to fill a couple of holes in the system that I use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As background, I use Sublime as my main IDE both for coding and for my legal work. I use a word processor, but only to review client documents and to do a final review on documents that I build. All the documents that build, I do so in Sublime. I write regular memos in regular markdown and pandoc them to ODT, double check the formating and output to PDF (and docx if the client needs it) using Libre's &lt;a href="http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/multisave-1">multiformat save extension&lt;/a>. I draft laws, regulations, contracts, and corporate governance documents in &lt;code>lmd&lt;/code> format, use legal_markdown package to push them (interstitially to normal markdown and then via pandoc) to ODT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system worked fine, but I did have to pull down my &lt;a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2013/03/terra-terminal-update-brings-improved.html">Terra terminal&lt;/a>, cd to the proper directory and run the pandoc command &amp;ndash; after converting the &lt;code>lmd&lt;/code> file in Sublime to normal markdown. So I knew I wanted to combine some of the better aspects of the various pandoc - sublime integrations (there are at least three that I know of) with the legal_markdown preprocessing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've now pushed the result. One of the differences in my implementation of pandoc integration (beyond the preprocessing by the legal_markdown gem obviously) is to utilize a document type definitional system. Basically, I wanted to be able to define different output document types and to pre-establish all of the pandoc options for these in my user settings file for the package. Then, when I wanted to export the &lt;code>lmd&lt;/code> file I just wanted a quick panel to show up where I could choose the export document type and let the package and pandoc take care of adding the correct mix of settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it works fine. Basically in the user settings, you add &amp;ldquo;build-format&amp;rdquo; keys and for each key you add a document type name (what will show up in the quick panel) key. Then inside this key you add whatever pandoc options you want. There are four main options that the package will use: &amp;ldquo;from&amp;rdquo; (pandoc's reader options), &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo; (pandoc's writer options), &amp;ldquo;file-output&amp;rdquo; (triggers pandoc's -o flag), and &amp;ldquo;options&amp;rdquo; (which you can use for general options such as &amp;ndash;normalize -S flags which are technically writer options but I think of them as general options). Each of the fields (except for the &amp;ldquo;file-output&amp;rdquo; field) should be an array. The &amp;ldquo;file-output&amp;rdquo; field should be either &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; or deleted. If it is deleted then the package will replace the currently active buffer with pandoc's output. Usually, for this package's purpose you will almost always want to have it asa true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, I wanted the package to automatically open a file for me. In other words when I'm converting a &lt;code>lmd&lt;/code> file to &lt;code>odt&lt;/code> I want to switch over to libreoffice to review the file. So the package also adds an optional field to each document type called &amp;ldquo;open-file-after-build&amp;rdquo;. This field is a simple command that you will call to open the file. The package will fill in the file that is outputted by pandoc after the command. So you &lt;strong>do not&lt;/strong> need to type &amp;ldquo;libreoffice $FILE&amp;rdquo; into the settings file, you simply need to type &amp;ldquo;libreoffice&amp;rdquo; into the settings file and the package will take care of the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have not tested the auto open in OSX or Windows so if anyone else has those boxes and can test it, that would be fantastic. I'm happy to work to make it cross platform compatible as much as I can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still have a bit more work to go on the package as you can see from the roadmap but it is now one step closer to where I'd like it to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

A really great system, actually. Especially for non-technical users. It also requires a huge amount of overhead for what most people use it for. Also, it is not nearly as fast and reliable as I would like it to be. So I decided that my blog needed to move from Wordpress to Jekyll. I had been using the same blog theme for about four years now so I also wanted to refactor that. Here's what I did to migrate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-1-install-ben-balters-migrate-to-jekyll-plugin">Step 1: Install Ben Balter's Migrate to Jekyll Plugin&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First, I downloaded Ben's migrate &lt;a href="https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter">plugin&lt;/a> for Wordpress. Then I unzipped that into my plugins directory in my Wordpress install (which I deploy from my workstation using git), enable the plugin and click Tools -&amp;gt; Export to Jekyll. Then the server will chew on it for a while and spit out a decent zip. The zip file has the templates (which I didn't use as I was rebuilding them from scratch and didn't care what the old ones looked like), the posts, and the pages you have on your blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were a few annoyances with the output, though. These annoyances are not any problem with the Exporter which worked as I expected it would. They were mainly annoyances with a lot of rust that is within the code/database of my blog. That rust was one of the main reasons that I wanted to switch to Jekyll. Since Jekyll is simply plain text files it is much simpler to iterate over the files and make the changes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Next, I worked on the layouts, includes, html files, config, rakefile and put everything how I wanted it to be. This was simple web design and there are lots of tutorials which were quite helpful in this endeavour. Once the Jekyll deployment looked and acted how I wanted it to, it was time to chew on the files.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first problem that I had with the export was that the yaml frontmatter was loaded with a lot of crap that I neither needed nor wanted for the Jekyll. So I thought I would build a small ruby script that would clean the YAML Frontmatter. Here's the part of the script that does that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That prt of the script mainly strips out the old rust from the YAML front matter and ensures that all my punctuation will not get in the way of Jekyll doing its job. For instance, I had lots of colons in my titles and these are a problem with YAML if you do not escape them or put the string in double quotes. Also I wanted all the posts to have some sort of a excerpt so if I did not have an excerpt in the Wordpress, I built the script to import the first paragraph and then escaped it and guarded against problems with punctuation in the paragraphh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second thing I had to overcome was the way the exporter handled images embedded in the text was not really how I wanted it. I am not sure if the exporter was made to export images or not, but I think because I run a multisite deployment &amp;ndash; and because Wordpress handles multisite files much differently than single site files &amp;ndash; that the images were a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I looked on my machine in the Blogs.dir for the Blog I was exporting I saw another problem which was that Wordpress saves a lot of different versions of the same file. This was going to be a problem when I tried to import the photos into the Jekyll asset pipeline I built.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was used to the ruby &lt;code>system&lt;/code> command but there was a problem when I tried to drop the return of the system command into a variable. And then I came upon my new favorite rubyism: backticks. These were great. They work just like backticks in bash/zsh scripting so they were quite intuitive. They run a system command and throw the result of that into a string variable &amp;ndash; which you can split, strip, do whatever you need. This let me build a &lt;code>find&lt;/code> command that I could use to get over the multiple files issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also needed to reformulate &lt;em>how&lt;/em> the images were called within the text. Wordpress puts a caption (which I almost always used) and the exporter used the reference link syntax that I don't particularly prefer in markdown. So I wanted to reform that part of the source posts. Here's the part of the script that did that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After I built the script and tested it on a few of the more recent posts I needed to run it on the entire directory of posts. I kept the posts in a separate directory out of the repo so if anything got screwed up with the script I could just re run it. I ended up having to do that a couple of times as I had to tweak my original version of the script a bit to arrive at what is presented above.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>rm -rf _posts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cp ~/Downloads/jekyll-export/_posts . -R &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git add _posts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./cleaner.rb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>One of the first things I realized was that I needed to add the &lt;code>_posts&lt;/code> dir to the the repo again as when you run jekyll it will &lt;code>git ls-files&lt;/code>. So I ran the above command until I was happy with the results and then I finally ran this command.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>rm -rf _posts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cp ~/Downloads/jekyll-export/_posts . -R &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git add _posts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./cleaner.rb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rake site:publish
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>That was it! The full cleaner script can be found in &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/compleatang/5401492">this gist&lt;/a>. If you want to use it, download it into the root of Jekyll, &lt;code>chmod +x cleaner.rb&lt;/code> and you will be all set.&lt;/p>

I mainly use Gnome Shell as my desktop environment, but since I use Ubuntu I keep Unity on my machine. I'm not a hater of Unity or Gnome as many Linux users (who can be quite vitriolic in their statements as to desktop environments). I &lt;em>mostly&lt;/em> use Gnome, but since Ubuntu has some interesting things going on with Unity sometimes I like to drop into Unity to see what I'm missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a problem at least in Ubuntu 12.10 running both desktops. To use Gnome Shell one &lt;em>should&lt;/em> install the &lt;code>gdm&lt;/code> package in order to get the full Gnome desktop experience - including the Gnome lock screen which is beautiful. GDM stands for Gnome Desktop Manager. It is an alternative to &lt;code>lightdm&lt;/code> which Ubuntu installs by default and which Unity uses. When you switch to gdm I found out that just after installing it you should logout of Unity before restarting your machine. But I didn't do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result of installing gdm and then restarting your machine is that the X server (which runs most of the linux desktops and lies in the stack underneath both gdm and lightdm) doesn't start correctly for &amp;ldquo;both&amp;rdquo; Unity and Shell. It is something to do with the way that dm loads the XSessions and it is beyond my understanding. In any event the problem for me was that while gdm made Shell work as it should out of the box, Unity would not load when I logged into Unity desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I built a small autostart script that for Unity that will load Unity after logging into the Ubuntu desktop. This was straight-forward. But the problem I had is that I didn't want the script to try to load Unity when I logged into Gnome. But, as usual with linux, with a bit of Googling I came across the key. In X session desktop scripts (which are the main way to start/run programs) you can define which desktop environment they should show up in. This means that when you put the script into the autostart folder (~/.config/autostart) you can mark the script to &amp;hellip; &lt;code>OnlyShowIn=GNOME;&lt;/code> or &lt;code>OnlyShowIn=UNITY;&lt;/code> or &lt;code>NotShowIn=GNOME;&lt;/code> or &lt;code>NotShowIn=UNITY;&lt;/code>. You can add multiple environments for the desktop script to be shown or hidden in after the semicolons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is helpful for showing or hiding certain programs/scripts in your menus in different desktop environments but also when you put it in the scripts in your autostart folder you can tell linux to only load the programs when you log into certain desktop environments. I tested the script and it didn't work at first. The problem was because gdm wasn't loading Unity, the autoload scripts I marked to only load in Unity weren't triggering. Even though gdm sent me to Unity, the desktop environment wasn't loading correctly. So I had to change the script from &lt;code>OnlyShowIn=UNITY;&lt;/code> to &lt;code>NotShowIn=GNOME;&lt;/code>. This meant that when the desktop environment saw that it was not in Shell it triggered the script for Unity. It isn't ideal as the autoload scripts that are linked to Unity don't run &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the Unity reload script runs, but it is a decent enough work around for the amount that I use Unity (minimal).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very powerful as you usually want Gnome Shell and Unity to load the different sugar packages such as applets, indicators, etc., that help you define the environment you are working in. This is reason 7 million why Linux is awesome. In any event, here's the script I use to reload the Unity desktop after I log into Unity.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>Desktop Entry&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
Type&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>Application
Exec&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>unity
Hidden&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>false
NoDisplay&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>false
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>true
Name&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>Unity-Reset
NotShowIn&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>GNOME;&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I saved that in ~/.config/autostart and voila all (mostly) working as it should.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On a day, of which the tenth anniversary is fast approaching, I was standing on a roundabout watching a bunch of people I knew and a machine I was familiar with rip down a statute. It was a day seared into my memory as I was thoroughly convinced that I was in the midst of an iconic moment. In some ways that belief was correct. Only it was just not the type of icon I was thinking it would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="baghdad-early-2003">Baghdad, Early, 2003&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wrote a book, and sold it based upon simply being present on that day in that locattion. I’ve been asked to give interviews (generally all around March or April of each year) not because I have anything particularly insightful to say about the invasion of Iraq, but merely because I was there. Present. Around. As the color of that day slowly desaturates in a process which only time understands and can justify, I have been reflecting not upon a machine, a chain, and a bronze statute. Instead, I’ve been reflecting upon something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point in the day, I and some friends were asked to give an interview. This was an exciting opportunity for the 26 year old version of the version of me currently typing this. It was exciting for two reasons in particular. First, I knew that there was a decent chance that word of the interview would float through the social networks of the time to my family. I thought someone somewhere will see this and let someone know and thereon until (hopefully) my family get some word that everything was OK. Second, I was excited about the interview because it was with ABC News. This was the outlet I used to watch as a growing child, a nightly voice, iconography, and color scheme that I knew well. I, along with some other friends, was going to be interviewed by Peter Jennings. And that dude’s a legend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the interview, I’m pretty sure that I really only had one line. Too nervous (and star struck perhaps) to say much else. But I did get in a line. Later my mother told me that while she recognized my face during the first part of the interview, she only really &lt;em>knew&lt;/em> it was me when she saw the sarcasm drip from my mouth. The irony is that, for once in my life, I actually wasn’t trying to be sarcastic. Peter asked the group of three or four of us that were gathered on the balcony of the Palestine Hotel if we felt safer now that we were in Baghdad. It was, frankly, a stupid question to ask a group of Marines from an infantry battalion laden with weapons and youthful egos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend Jack, who eventually became my co-author, gave the answer that you are supposed to give in such situations. He said that it did not matter, that our guard was up and we were fully prepared for anything that may come — whether that was a chicken dinner or a bunch of bullets — and that we were ready and capable of responding appropriately. During the days that followed, in the chaos that was the early days of post-invasion Baghdad, we would have to face both of those scenarios, and many more, sometimes at the same moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The war junky reporter on the ground pointed the mic at me, and (at least as I remember it) I simply asked one question: “Do &lt;em>you&lt;/em> feel safer now that we are here?”&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="twenty-nine-palms-ca-late-2002">Twenty-Nine Palms, CA, Late, 2002&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the run up to the war I did not allow any part of my brain to engage in an intellectual discourse with any other part of my brain as to the rightness or wrongness of the job any idiot could see was coming for us. I had a job to do, and I was damn determined to be good at that job. Or at least, to try my best to be good at it. I was worried that if I allowed the self-felating ethical discourse to overtake and supplant my thinking that I would not be as fast, as precise, as &lt;em>on&lt;/em> as I needed to be in order to actually accomplish the job that was coming for me. Perhaps, upon reflection from the perspective of ten years, that was the incorrect decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps it was the correct decision. Either way, it would not have mattered. I did not meet the religious pre-affiliation rules in order to actually be a conscientious objector and therefore it was going to be an offense that would lead me to a court martial if I did not do my best to accomplish my job. And when I’m brutally honest with myself, I was excited about it. I wanted to go. Because when you go into the Marines, especially into an infantry battalion, if you don’t go to war it is basically just masturbation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this time, before we deployed to Kuwait, my friend Faith forwarded an email detailing the time and location of upcoming anti-war demonstrations in New Orleans where she was living at the time. To my …@usmc.mil email address. When I first got the email I smiled. I was pleased that anti-war demonstrations were happening. In some ways it made it easier to accept my own, conscious, lack of any ethical discourse within myself. But to my work email address? I saw that it was just to a bunch of people, as many forwarded emails were in the times before facebook. So I didn’t really blame her. Yet, I did respond to the email. Although I don’t fully remember what I wrote, I think it was something along the lines of “Thanks for the email. I fully support your right to do that. Just don’t send any such emails to my work account!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do remember thinking at one point after I replied (in probably an overly cold way) that that was their job and I had my job and our jobs were different. Then I simply put it out of my mind and went about preparing what needed to be prepared.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hargeisa-somaliland-early-2013">Hargeisa, Somaliland, Early, 2013&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My reply to Peter Jennings was not meant as sarcasm. My reply was meant honestly. Although my voice, combined with my love of sarcasm, led most to believe I meant it sarcastically. After the intensity of the now that was then has dissipated and we Americans are forced to live with the choices of the leaders we chose, and the knowledge that many Iraqis are also forced to live with the choices of the leaders they did not choose, I will ask it again. “Do you feel safer now that we are here?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will stop at this point and say one thing. If someone wants to put some faux comment on this post saying, “thank you for your service” I will delete it. I absolutely abhor those comments. They ring hollow to me and mean absolutely nothing. I did not really serve. I did a job. Sure those that entered the armed forces after 9/11 knew, in a way that I had no idea of when I signed on the line, or, at a minimum, they had some idea of, what they were getting into. Perhaps they “served” in the sense that word is often used. But I did not. I simply did a job. A job that I was contractually obliged to do. And, perhaps, wanted to do. But either way, it was a job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet there’s another, more important, reason that I abhor that phrase.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="champaign-illinois-late-1999">Champaign, Illinois, Late, 1999&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We had a tradition in our Naval Reserve Officer’s Training Corp (ROTC) group that on the last Thursday before anyone graduated they had an opportunity to take the floor. Most used it as a way to proffer vapid “advice” on matters of which they knew not or to provide idiotic thank yous to people they would never see again and perhaps neither liked nor respected. That all seemed quite stupid to my 23 year old self. When my turn came, after some of my best and greatest friends had their chance to say what they felt appropriate to say, I stood up and recited the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
Tellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood:
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
She made well sure her neighbors understood&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh! Good old-fashioned war!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
While she couldn’t even recognize his face!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
How is it you come to be this way?”
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh! Lord! Just like mine!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
That I was just a puppet in a play
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
And a cannonball blew my eyes away”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~ John Brown by Bob Dylan (lyrics available &lt;a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/john-brown#ixzz2O6Kzjo5a" title="Bob Dylan - John Brown">here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Here I was, 23. Mere days from beginning The Basic School, which is where all Marine Officers begin their journey. Reciting the lyrics of a poet famously known for his anti-war positions to a bunch of people who were only months away from beginning their journeys in the military. But I had a point. A point I still believe deeply in. A point I never explained, as when I finished reciting the poetry that is Dylan’s song I simply walked out of the room (or just sat down, can’t remember exactly).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fourteen years later, let me get to the point. If you are going to do this thing called the military. Called war. Know what the hell you are getting yourself into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did not mean don’t do war, and there is nothing within the song (even from my now quite adamant anti-war position) that is actually overtly anti-war. The real message of the song is that those that cheerlead for war without understanding the consequences of what they are saying do a great disservice to those that actually do go to war. Those that go to war, that enter the military, are forced to struggle with what this means to each. This thing we call war. Of course what it means, being an existential question, will differ from person to person. The point is not the answer arrived at by any individual, the point is that the individual took that journey. Dylan was not saying that those people who embark upon this journey and exit it with some conclusion are bad. He was not saying that war was bad or good, right or wrong, or any other other banal symbols lazy people use when they do not want to struggle with a difficult question. What Dylan was saying is that those who cheerlead from the sidelines but do not embark upon this journey themselves — with honesty and self-reflection — are more harming to society than those that hold the guns and fire the rounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hargeisa-somaliland-early-2013-1">Hargeisa, Somaliland, Early, 2013&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And this is how I find &lt;em>most&lt;/em> of the “thanks for your service”. So let me say it more clearly. Just because Fox News, whose editorial board learned from the heartbreaking stories of Vietnam veterans (who often had no choice whether to go and who often acted in the best way they knew in some crazy situations) returning home to be spat upon, tells people that it is somehow patriotic to thank veterans for their service does not mean that it actually is. Am I saying that it is &lt;em>bad&lt;/em> to say that, or that others will not fully appreciate if one were to say the same phrase to them? Not in the slightest. But I am saying that, to me, the phrase is mostly a vapid self-justification more beneficial to the speaker than to the spoken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Do you feel safer now?” I meant it when I said it. And I mean it now. It is easy for us that feel the Iraq War was a shameful enterprise to embark upon to blame Bush and Cheney for entering a war unilaterally, without justification that has cost over 4,400 American lives, cost probably a hundred times that in Iraqi lives, brought innumerable wounds, severed innumerable families, and cost over $3T (money which would have solved world hunger twice over by many estimates). In my mind that is not the question. Sure Bush and Cheney were power hungry, manipulative, and greedy. You don’t become President of the United States by being humble. We Americans, we reward the greedy, hungry, manipulative people in business, in politics, in celebrity culture. We have done it for years and there is no abatement in sight. In fact the “American Dream” is simply a less egregious version of this. In other words, we have built it into our Nation’s DNA. While I have problems, big problems, with their legal justification for entering the war and I am wary that we have set a precedent within international law that does not progress us humans down the road of tolerance and dialogue, I don’t blame them any more than I blame America as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last few days I’ve seen an onslaught of &lt;em>mea culpas&lt;/em> from media elite saying, why didn’t we do our job as the media? That’s fine. They should feel guilt as they committed gross malpractice. But there was plenty of commentary available, even in those days before social media (did the world exist before social media?), to those that wanted to find it. Hell, I knew it was around and I was actively trying to avoid it. So, if I’m honest with myself they certainly played their part, but I don’t blame them any more than I blame America as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I meant when I asked Peter Jennings, and his many American viewers, that question is this. I am doing my job. A job that collectively, you citizens, you media, and you the leaders we all elected collectively, have sent me to do. My own personal views as to my safety is 100% beside the point. I am a Marine. My job is to stand between danger and Americans. I am trying my best to do this. But you, the American people must ask yourself, do YOU feel safer? I’ve done my part, my job. Did you do yours?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who do I blame the most, if blame is to be apportioned at all? I blame the cheerleaders. All of them. From the bureaucracy to the media to the businessmen licking their chops at the chance to exploit defense budgets to the average citizens putting up yellow ribbons and in their hearts pleased that their son/daughter/brother/sister/friend was “doing their part.” I blame the cheerleaders for not learning from the demonstrators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the next time you simply take a politician at their word without a thoughtful examination of what you actually think on the matter, the next time you choose to rename “french fries” to “freedom fries” because the French polity had the gall to challenge their leaders and to demand a continuation of the, admittedly cold, peace. In these times, ask yourself: “Do I feel safer now?”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the first meeting, I will try to ferret out what the client is trying to achieve. This is generally an overview meeting. Mostly, Somalis do not like doing too much in any one meeting &amp;ndash; especially if they do not know you well. So I try to keep the goals of what I need to achieve in these meetings realistic and limited. During this meeting, I try to give them an idea of in which direction we are likely to take the transaction in terms of what types of contract(s) are going to be involved to facilitate and integrate the transaction. I also usually try to give the client a few of the key, and usually poignant, decisions that they will have to make so that they can mull it over between the first and second meetings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the second meeting, I will ask a lot more specific questions. This meeting is all about the details. Prior to the meeting I will have planned out the transaction documents and forked the appropriate templates of whatever documents will be required for the transaction. I use the specific forks of the primary templates as the basis of my checklist for the transaction. This is easy when building templates in legal_markdown form and sublime. I have been building (but haven't open sourced it yet) a small script that automates this process for me. In my contract templates I just type &lt;code>...?ASK?...&lt;/code> or &lt;code>...?CONFIRM?...&lt;/code> and then the script finds these and builds them into a checklist specific to the transaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know a lot of transactional attorneys like to build checklists based on the type of transaction. I have a few of those, but I find that usually I spend more time deleting irrelevant items and overall they are inefficient for me. I prefer to build questions into my document templates and then to build my checklist for the transaction based on the document templates that I'm going to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, this week I've been working on two different joint venture agreements. They are very different from one another and are based on two different templates (one of which is a fork of the main JV template that I have built). For me, it is more efficient to pull my checklists from each of the templates than it would be to fork a main joint venture checklist and then adapt that for each type of transaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In other words, the key is to integrate your checklist building with your template building. This has many distinct advantages, not the least of which are precision and efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The script that builds the checklists for me in sublime produces a list of questions. These provide me with the base the agenda of the second, more detail oriented, meeting with the client. Usually I print the checklist as I find that Somalis usually find a screen in the room either disrespectful or disorienting. So I usually just write my answers on the printed checklist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that second meeting, I build the first drafts of the documents necessary for the transaction. As I said earlier, I build my templates into a main repo and then fork the necessary templates from the main repo into the repo for the client. When I build templates I fill them with mixins, optional clauses, and questions. All I have to do after the second meeting is to fill in the answers to the questions that I have by replacing all the &lt;code>...?QUESTIONS?...&lt;/code> with the answers. Usually this just means filling in the YAML front matter of the template.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I have finished answering the questions, entering the mixins and selecting or deselecting the optional clauses (all of which I do in the YAML front matter), I simply save the legal_markdown file &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pandoc it based on my contract template .odt. Then I open the .odt in libreoffice where I do a final read through of the contract, tweak the styles if necessary, and save as .pdf / .doc / .odt or whatever the client needs to review the document. All of these steps (minus the final review in libreoffice) I perform from sublime. I build the templates there, I massage the YAML front matter there, I pandoc from there, and I open the .odt file from there. It is basically a full scale contracts IDE for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the client has reviewed the documents I will sometimes edit in Sublime, but if the changes are marginal then I find it more efficient to make the changes in Libreoffice and voila. Done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pandoc for Legal Documents</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2013/2013-01-24-pandoc-legal-documents/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2013/2013-01-24-pandoc-legal-documents/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately, I have been writing a lot in markdown. It is a freeing way to write documents because you focus more on the words than the tools around you in the wordprocessing interface. You pick your favorite environment to write &amp;ndash; for me it is Sublime Text &amp;ndash; and then you write. But, clients and courts do not read Github Flavored Markdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where &lt;a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html">Pandoc&lt;/a> comes into play. Pandoc is one of the many markdown renderers / translators available. You can think of it like a swiss army knife for changing document types. The thing that makes Pandoc quite interesting, for my purposes as a lawyer, is that it when you translate your markdown into an .odt file (or .docx for those who like completely bloated, prorietary things) you can establish exactly how the end document will look.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you do is first output some markdown text into an .odt file. Then you go into LibreOffice and modify the styles so that they are appropriate. I have templates setup for most of the documents I create and I simply linked the main styles that I use in my markdown to the ones in the template .ott files. I created multiple Pandoc .odt templates (which Pandoc calls reference files) to more or less mirror my .ott files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Sublime, I &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/sublimetext-Pandoc">forked&lt;/a> the excellent Pandoc plugin to modify it so that I could build custom templates and added a few other goodies so that Pandoc would play nicer with .odt files (which were not included in the original version). Using the forked Pandoc plugin I can simply output my markdown files to the appropriate reference file. I use the SideBarEnhancements plugin to right click on the newly created .odt and open in Libre to finalize everything. Mainly this entails dropping in my citations from Zotero and making sure that the styling is fine and everything is looking as it should. Save the new .odt file in GDrive. Output the .pdf to GDrive. Close the task on Teambox. Email the client. Done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most annoying things about using a wordprocesser and doing research is the new lines that pdf copy places on your clipboard. Since Python is a relatively straightforward language and not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> different from Ruby for simple text manipulation, and since Sublime offers a very easy to understand API, it was quite easy &amp;ndash; even for a beginner such as I &amp;ndash; to &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/sublimetext-pastepdf">build a plugin&lt;/a> that will allow me to ctrl+alt+v and thus strip the newlines so that the text block pastes as a single text block.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because Pandoc has inline footnoting, when I'm writing I simply drop in a marker quickly where I need to reference things. When Pandoc translates the markdown into an .odt file it builds the footnotes with the markers I need (usually pinpoints). Then I can simply inserting the citations from Zotero. When I was doing some research the other day I realized that FastCase does not have a translator for Zotero so I started working on one. It will be coming soon. And more about integrating Zotero and LibreOffice for legal research will accompany that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For legal documents, particularly client focused documents, you don't really need that much formatting. Indeed the less the better. Really you need only a handfull of styles within the document. Using a system such as this to force the proper styling techniques you can easily roll branding rules for your small firm and also let lawyers focus on the text rather than another Format Paste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Admitedly, collaboration is still imperfect. A huge percentage of lawyers still are on Word and so the .doc and .docx formats and awful Calibri are not going away anytime soon. There is no simple way, when you need to track changes and integrate comments into a document, to utilize some of the tools that make writing so much more enjoyable on a text processor. Luckily, however, using these techniques allows me to limit my time in a word processor &amp;ndash; even a quite nice one like LibreOffice.&lt;/p>

It has been ongoing for four years that I can remember but perhaps longer. It revolves around the forthrightness of campaigns to speak to the electorate logically, with courage, and while keeping within the bounds of logic and reasonableness. Instead of what I desperately want campaigns to do they do the opposite, spiraling into ever more irrelevant crap. Gaffes and ah ha’s are fun and interesting political theater but that is all it is. Theater. Theater is a farce. And we must stop hiring representatives to govern us based on a farcical audition system. This I have felt deeply for a long time. It colors most of my political worldview, rightly or wrongly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>John Dickerson wrote a &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/WyS3iH" title="How To Measure for a President, by John Dickerson">series&lt;/a> of pieces this week that I hope with all the optimism my increasing cynicism can muster that someday it will be viewed as a transformative work. In his work he pleads with the electorate in a way I know he believes. I’ve spent an hour a week more or less for the past seven years and I believe that he believes every word he wrote. His authenticity is easy to trust and recognize with that much exposure. His argument is basically that we need to rethink about how we treat Presidential campaigns. We are covering the wrong things he says to the media elite. You are emphasizing the wrong things he says to the campaigns. We are rewarding the wrong behavior he tells the electorate. And all of them/us need to hear it because all have a roll in fixing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what can we the electorate do? In my opinion it is our duty to educate ourselves about the issues, about what the President can actually control, and to take a decision based upon those items rather than the metrics of how many gaffes some poor guy or girl exposed to immense pressure takes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An informed and reasonable electorate is the only way we can pull ourselves out of this death spiral of hyper partisanship, reactionary media coverage, and off the charts dissatisfaction. We the electorate have as much to do with this, perhaps more, than the candidates do. Political leaders aren’t really leaders at all. At least in a democracy they are supposed to represent their constituents’ interests. Vying too far outside of these, and the politician loses their representative title. We call those people here in Africa: Dictators. The simple fact is that a politician is constrained by public opinion. So an ill-informed electorate, purposefully or otherwise, will logically reward the loudest rather than the smartest. Here’s the rub. We get the country we demand folks. When we refuse to educate ourselves on what the President does when we don’t demand intellectual and reasoned debate rather than stupid gaffery we end up with….Fox News and MSNBC yelling past each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are in a difficult situation. Right now. In the short term, I’m pessimistic, but in the long term I’m optimistic. I remain hopeful for two primary reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the grip of push consumption models of information continues to wane and simultaneously individual trust is replacing brand trust within the media. The former matters because when one unplugs from cable and consumes media and information on a purely pull model one’s ability to consume and process that information substantially increases. When you are in the mood for bubble gum you aren’t receptive to political messaging. Subliminal and uninformed voters barely process TV adds anymore. We are numb to them. But when you are in the mood for political messaging, you are in much better frame of mind to process that information. This is augmented by – the latter – individual trust located within both of one’s social graphs and interest graphs. Both of these significantly increase the ease which one can enter into the information funnel at headlines and steadily work downward through the increasing complexity to extreme wonkland if interested merely by reading, thinking, and clicking. Twitter leads to articles lead to counter arguments lead to source data. While this information funnel needs some work, people like Ethan Zuckerman at the Berkman Center and other terribly smart guys are thinking deeply about how this can operate. It will get better. And we will get better at using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second reason I resist encroaching cynicism is the rise of the Maker class. Art from Andy Warhol to the Breakfast Club to Rage Against the Machine has been warning us against getting too big and too homogeneous  It won’t work the artists warned. And they led the world. Long before there was a consultant class there were independent artists. But now DIY is everywhere and not only because Home Depot wants to sell you some lumber. Big is out and small is in. And I for one am incredibly satisfied. Music, for me, has never been more diverse and more wonderful. Despite the RIAA apocolypsing, music is the best I have ever experienced. And I’ve been following music for a decent little while now. Food is similarly wonderful. Farm to table restaurants and good wines make the old suburban standbys just places you go by default when you’re not in the know or when you are resigned to mediocrity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small is in. Small is great. But small is messy. It refuses to be categorized as easily. It celebrates the individual, with its flaws and eccentricities, not in tension with the community (as the rhetoric from the right so often tries to frame it) but as part of it. Integral to the flow of the community. But this becomes problematic politically. Or so some argue. If  we decentralize and fracture the currently coalitions underpinning the current form of the Republican and Democratic parties so wonder what will happen thereafter. Some wonder if we had more than two viable national parties whether people would be able to parse the differences. I have no idea whether that is true, but I know that music, which is much farther ahead of politics in this area, is better than it is ever been. This is why I remain (perhaps unreasonably) optimistic.&lt;/p>

Being that I was a Marine officer once upon a moon, this person asked whether my blood was up about them passing away and what I thought about the President putting our people in danger like that. Their words. Yes, of course my blood was up. I felt deeply for their families and for the poor souls who had to notice their families and for the entire situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there is a bigger picture here that I want to point out. These guys faced an impossible task. Utterly impossible. There was no right answer for them and all these people screaming about why aren’t our embassies safer and posting about the poor Marines do a disservice to their service. As Marines we are not in the business of allowing ourselves to be victimized. That, in my opinion,  is a bigger disservice to those Marines than a simple and honest answer: this is the fog of Krulak’s three block war. Before I explain Krulak’s theory, let us first try to picture the decisions these Marines had to take.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was not there that night in Benghazi and I make no claims on knowledge of the attack other than what I’ve seen on the news. The below should be taken for no more than it is meant to be: a thought experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are in a safehouse and it is 9/11. You are in a predominately Muslim country and as opposed to all the other Muslim countries you’ve likely been in recently, in this one they don’t hate you. In fact you are accompanying the Ambassador to the heartland, the ground zero, of the movement your country helped to achieve power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been riots but you likely pay those no mind. Not because you are negligent, but precisely because you are not scared of them. Even if you have been told of possible security concerns, you probably still pay them no mind. You understand the waxes and wanes of the moods of crowds. Sure you stay vigilant. Your helmet stays on and your weapon is there, but it is just people annoyed. They aren’t attacking you. And chances are damn good that you know what it feels like when a crowd turns on you, when the focus of collective disdain is you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or perhaps you do feel it. Perhaps the security briefings and 9/11 and the feel of the crowd tingle your spidey senses. What are you going to do about it? Absolutely nothing. You just stay there, vigilant. Your helmet stays on and your weapon is there. And you watch. And wait. And listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you hear the woosh of an RPG you barely have any time to react before the bang of the detonation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now what? Do you fire back? Who exactly are you going to fire at? You have very likely been taught that aimlessly shooting into crowds is an atrocious idea. Anyway, it is night and this is guard duty. You know you don’t have the full range of combined arms at your disposal you may have had in Afghanistan or Iraq. You know that you have only a few guys with small arms. And you have no idea who is shooting at you or how many they are. You are smart enough to know that now is not the time for asking the why. You are also smart enough to remember that this city is highly militarized and while they generally like you now, you understand damn well how fleeting that public opinion is. And shooting randomly into the crowd isn’t going to help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you had the luck to see the shooters location and had tracked his movements through the crowds on grainy NVGs because you are a superhuman. And even if that guy was stupid enough to give you a clear shot. (It must be said that the chances for that happening are basically nil) How sure are you that you can make that shot in the midst of a heaving crowd at night from distance?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So do you go after him? If you pursue, you leave the place you are supposed to be guarding, and worse you leave the *person *you are supposed to be guarding. The Ambassador. In the olden days people were hung for decisions like those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ambassador. That jogs your mind. How is he?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above sequence of thoughts took me twenty times longer to type then for you to process. Perhaps a hundred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You inquire about the ambassador and are told that he is injured. There are people everywhere. People are shouting. It is dark. You have no idea who is who. Still the consulate is being fired on. Even if you were superhuman enough to track the shooter they have melted back into the crowd while you were checking on the ambassador.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This my friends is chaos. Utter and complete chaos. Not complexity. F-ing chaos. You can call it the shit, the fog of war, or any of the other catchy terms people give to it. But that’s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will say this. I am not sad that it was Marines that passed away that night. If it had to have been anyone I would gladly take Marines over private contractors, over anyone else. I want Marines on those walls because I know that they know how to make the best possible decision given the constraints in which they are forced to operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We Marines have had a chip on our shoulder from basically the time of our birth. We have never really fit into the overall structure of the armed forces. We are neither the round peg nor the square hole. We are both. And we are neither. Our neither-ness makes us the first to have our money taken during defense drawdowns, but our both-ness makes us the first to be called on in a crisis. We pride ourselves on our ability to do more with less. To go anywhere and do anything that is asked of us. It is this adaptability, this chameleon like ability to properly react to chaos, that is the reason we guard (ceremonially these days) the White House and (not so ceremonially) embassies all around the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Training for these scenarios used to be standard faire. I have no idea whether it is anymore as I’ve been out of the game for a long time. We train for basically everything. From humanitarian intervention, to quasi conflict (like that night in Benghazi) in crowded spaces full of noncombatants, to full scale kill the enemy conflict. And last week Marines were doing all three of these. In numerous locations around the world. With grace and with honor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is this spectrum from completely mundane and non-violent (but foreign) to fully violent that General Krulak was talking about in 1999 when he wrote his seminal piece called the Strategic Corporal: Leadership in the Three Block War. I had graduated OCS but was not yet a Marine officer when he published that piece. And that piece of work is truly a seminal piece as it influenced greatly an entire generation of Marines. In it Krulak argued that the Marines needed to build a force capable of ratcheting up and down the violence as appropriate for the situation. This is incredibly dangerous stuff. It is much safer to retreat to bases and hide behind technological solutions than it is to get out of the bubble and walk the streets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But under Krulak’s tutelage the Marines adapted. And the fires of a zillion firefights and uneventful patrols have proved old Chuck was right. That young people can be trained to react appropriately and honorably under the craziest, most screwed, utterly chaotic of situations. Because, that’s what Marines, especially Marines who understand the challenges and risks inherent in the three block war, that’s what they do.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to feel emotional about something that is fine. But don’t denigrate the honor of the Marines who died that evening in Benghazi by loftily screaming for more security, higher walls, more razor wire; by pretending that these Marines were some lambs to the slaughter. They may or may not have fought that night, but I have full faith and allegiance to the same that they most certainly had a good reason for whatever they did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I know even more than that they most certainly were not victims to be held up as a symbol in order to win votes. It was Remember the Maine that was the slogan, not Remember the Marines on the Maine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My America Band: Wax Fang</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-04-01-my-america-band/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-04-01-my-america-band/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/2012/04/IMAG0237.jpg">&lt;img src="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com/assets/images/2012/IMAG0237.jpg" alt="Wax Fang at the Basement 31.03.12 by Casey Kuhlman" tit="Wax Fang at the Basement 31.03.12 by Casey Kuhlman" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you sit with people from other countries, it is important to have some fall back, standardized way to explain where you are from. Of course we all have these icons, these posters, these fleeting images that remind ourselves of where we came from and are readily recalled by our frontal cortex when asked to explain ourselves. When we trust the person and we know that the question is meant because the other conversant(s) truly does want to understand us, then we are more easily able to open up and to tell the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I want to explain American rock music, and in a little bit the America that I know and love, to people who only know of America from what their news and Hollywood tells them I have a go to band. My icon for all that is great and wonderful about American rock music. Wax Fang.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are three dudes from Louisville who just build face melting rock and roll music. It is fast, aggressive, in your face, and musically delicious. In something like 2006 or so I saw them at Exit In for what was then known as Next Big Nashville. I think we were going to see a different band and just happened upon Wax Fang. They melted my face. Since then I’ve seen them a couple of times at the Basement. Always I’ve left with a melted face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three dudes who know how to play their instruments really damn well, who don’t hide behind loops and over-reverb and autotuners. They play straight-forward. The guitarist has some David Gilmour, some Bowie. The bassist is just rock solid. And the drummer may be one of my favorite contemporary drummers. When I put on their La La Land album (particularly while driving because what could be more American than that), and drive all I can do is think of this all screwed up, dirty, aggressive, lovely, caring, wonderful country that we’ve built for ourselves and smile. So without further ramblings…. Wax Fang.&lt;/p>

For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>New EUNAVFOR guidelines allow attacking &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pirate">#pirate&lt;/a> targets on late, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23NATO">#NATO&lt;/a> task force stays maritime. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23somalia">#somalia&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— Jay Bahadur (@PuntlandPirates) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PuntlandPirates/status/183275482962341888">March 23, 2012&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My thoughts were quickly to escalation. Escalation is important not only for reasons that &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> who feels attacked or invaded would be willing to increase the violence to protect their stuff, but also because Somalis feel incredibly threatened right now. With four other countries operating uninvited in their country along with a bunch of other global jihadists who have very little – but not non-negligible – constituencies within Somali areas. If ever there was a time to beat the hornet’s nest, when they already are upset is not the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently this chatter was due to a press release by the EU which is available &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/GUnMps" title="EU Extends Counter Piracy Mission Off Coast of Somalia">here&lt;/a> (title: EU Extends Counter Piracy Mission Off Coast of Somalia). Their complete release (my emphasis):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On Friday 23 March 2012 the Council of the European Union confirmed its intention to extend the EU Naval Force (EU NAVFOR) counter-piracy mission, Operation ATLANATA off the Somali coast until December 2014.  At the same time the Council also extended the area of operations &lt;em>to include Somali coastal territory&lt;/em> and internal waters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today’s decision will enable Operation Atalanta Forces to work directly with the Transitional  Federal Government and other Somali entities to support their fight against piracy in the coastal areas.  In accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, the Somali government has notified the UN Secretary General of its acceptance of the EU’s offer for this new collaboration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking about the extension of the mandate and area of operations, Rear Admiral Duncan Potts, who is the Operational Commander of the EU Naval Force, said “The extension of the mandate until the end of 2014 confirms the EU’s commitment to fighting piracy off the Horn of Africa. Piracy has caused so much misery to the Somali people and to the crews of ships transiting the area and it is right that &lt;em>we continue to move forward in our efforts&lt;/em>”.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Those five words towards the end of the first paragraph and those eight words at the end of that small press release are important. ICTY was set up because of just about as many words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The BBC ran an &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/GUpBCV" title="Somalia pirates: EU approves attacks on land bases">article&lt;/a> headlined “Somalia pirates: EU approves attacks on land bases.” Here’s the highlights from the article:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told reporters: “The EU plan is to allow attacks on land installations when ships are assaulted at sea,” adding that “much care” would be taken to avoid civilian deaths….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rear Admiral Duncan Potts, the operation commander for the EU Naval Force in Somalia, said … ”At sea we’ve had an effect on the pirates’ ability to operate but we haven’t changed the strategic conditions, which is why we want to target every stage of their operations.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Minister seems to be implying that only self-defence combined with hot pursuit would be a trigger for attack of land targets; whereas the EU’s commander is seemingly signalling something entirely different that the EU is interested in attacking more strategically to disrupt the entire ecosystem’s operation. That disparity aside, what is difficult to contemplate is what will actually happen with this. We don’t have the actual directive at this point (if you have a copy I’d love to see it) so how can we tell legally what the heck is going on?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also problems (in my mind at least) with the use of force at all, but at least on the high seas to stop an operation in progress we can skirt around many of the IHL issues that could be invoked. IHL is the acronym for International Humanitarian Law which is known by many laypersons as the Law of War. There are two sets of basic sets of rules that can be used to regulate the activities of the piracy enforcement regime. IHL is one. I do not think that it is involved. After living and lawyering in the Somali region for four years, I remain deeply skeptical as to the purported links between those accused of acts of piracy and those involved in the conflict not of an international character between the various factions on land within South-Central Somalia. From time to time there are reports that Shabaab is somehow involved, but I have yet to see those sufficiently substantiated (at least in my mind). This is important, because without these linkages then IHL will not be operative and another body of law will control the piracy enforcement regime: International Human Rights Law (IHRL).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is much more complex then this, but let me simplify for the purposes of this post: IHL is very lenient set of rules compared to IHRL in the area of the application of violence. The language used by the Rear Admiral above is very much in keeping with IHL norms that allow military commanders to target and attack based on the overall military advantage of such attacks. In other words, German industrial towns pose no direct threat to the allies during WWII, but the allies legally leveled these cities due to the overall military advantage of shutting down the industrial system that was supplying German troops with arms and ammunition. Human rights law has a very different take on the application of violence due to the paramount importance that it places on the right to life alongside fair trial rights. Human rights law does not allow the application of violence with such a sweeping scope as IHL. It requires a much more surgical approach along with some provocation. The standard under IHRL is that there must be an immediate threat to life in order for a law enforcement officer to kill a suspect, or else the suspect must be taken to court where fair trial rights can be invoked to decide of the suspect can be put to death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/GUtQyd" title="Beth Van Schaack">Beth Van Schaack&lt;/a> wrote an Opinion Juris &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/GY8mgp" title="A Response to Douglas Guilfoyle by Beth Van Schaack">post&lt;/a> about this IHLIHRL issue about a while ago (November, 2010):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Professor Guilfoyle] concludes that in the majority of circumstances, piracy is a law enforcement problem, not a law of war problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The seemingly facile conclusion of the article, however, dodges the more difficult question of the impact of a potential nexus between acts of piracy and the ongoing non-international armed conflict in Somalia between the beleaguered Transitional Federal Government and a loose coalition of fundamentalist militias. If such a link is eventually established or confirmed, IHL may apply to some acts of piracy committed in order to fund organized armed groups or regional warlords engaged in the protracted insurgency against the government of Somalia. The article would have made a more significant contribution had it focused more searchingly on this question of what type or degree of war nexus would be necessary to trigger the application of IHL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One implication of such a nexus would be that attacks on commercial vessels such as we have seen in the Gulf of Aden may become prosecutable as war crimes (&lt;em>viz&lt;/em>, violence to life and person or the taking of hostages)….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of the application of IHL, the international community should not lose sight of the fact that international human rights law remains applicable to the collective international response to acts of piracy. In a companion piece, Professor Guilfoyle focuses on the law governing the extraterritorial application of human rights law, the principle of non-refoulement, the prohibition of arbitrary detention, and due process protections (see Douglas Guilfoyle, Counter-Piracy Law Enforcement and Human Rights, 59 Int’l &amp;amp; Comp L Q 141 (2010)). In addition, the prohibitions of summary execution and other arbitrary deprivations of the right to life also establish limitations of necessity and proportionality on uses of force against individuals in the exercise of national and international police powers (see McCann v UK, 21 EHRR 97 (1996)).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The distinction between the two sets of rules are important not only because they have very different rules in how they authorize law enforcement or military personnel to apply violence towards a given situation, but also they are important to our understanding of the cultural dynamics of a given situation. When we think something is regulated by IHL we mentally apply a militaristic point of view to a situation. This is the problem when we call it the War on Terrorism when in my opinion it should be more properly characterized as a law enforcement situation against acts of terrorism. In any event, the conflict between the US and Al Qaeda aside, when it comes to Somalis the law enforcement versus military lens is extraordinarily important because as I said earlier Somalis already feel they are under attack. Largely there is a perception that the pirates are basically Robin Hood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sending military task forces to attack land targets in Eyl or any of the other pirate areas would be disastrous foreign policy as it would not only endanger all of us Westerners that operate in the Somali region but it would also have a counter effect to the desired end state. The Somali society has been turning against the pirate culture slowly by slowly, but attacks on land targets would allow them to leverage the nationalistic undercurrents within Somali culture to regain their cultural momentum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can basically think of no policy which would be worse than this policy and I truly hope that when the EUNAVFOR implements it, they take a close look at both the legal and cultural effects of what they are doing.&lt;/p>

Here’s to a massive flop or a spectacular success. Here’s to nothing in between. Here’s to risk. Here’s to reward. Here’s to taking a chance. Here’s to never being satisfied with what is. Here’s to questioning. Here’s to listening. Here’s to excellence. Here’s to professionalism. Here’s to helping everywhere we can in every way we can to everyone we can. Here’s to solving problems. Here’s to trust in unwavering allies. And most of all. Here’s doing our best to impact in those we touch in some small way that truly speaking tomorrow is going to be a better day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Micro-States; Pirates; Terrorists; The London Conference: What a Fascinating Time for Watchers of Somalis</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-01-30-micro-states-pirates-terrorists-the-london-conference-what-a-fascinating-time-for-watchers-of-somalis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-01-30-micro-states-pirates-terrorists-the-london-conference-what-a-fascinating-time-for-watchers-of-somalis/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/burningmax/2987516225/">&lt;img src="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com/assets/images/2012/2987516225_11e2cef572.jpg" alt="somali-days by burningmax @ flickr" tit="somali-days by burningmax @ flickr" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For almost four years now I’ve been a careful observer of Somali politicians. For three of those years I was paid to try to be their lawyer. To provide them expert international legal assistance tied to a deep network full of some of the finest international practitioners and thinkers in the world. But they rarely, if ever, wanted that help. So largely I invented work, I went into meetings and had a product to sell. &lt;em>I can’t buy you new computers, but I how about I help you write that legal framework that Parliament has required you to do&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve spent a lot of time with Somali politicians, and I also spend a lot of time with other people who spend a lot of their time with Somali politicians. This is an expat’s life when you live in a pretty small town. I reference Hargeisa, a town of, oh, 500,00 to 1M people depending on who’s estimating as a small town.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that it truly is. This is one of the most amazing things when you really get to know an African town. To learn how inter-connected things are is fascinating. This is what makes me do something foolish like invest everything I have into starting a law firm in a country which has very little (if any) law. Judges routinely dismiss cases with little to no justification. Parliamentarians make no estimates, and rarely even discuss, what the effects of this law will be in the next month, much less the next year – so legislation (a lot of it quite decent) is routinely ignored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet things work. I don’t believe in libertarianism – much to my father’s chagrin – it is incredibly unjust and inefficient. But I can say the Somalis are teaching me how to respect it, and how to work within its boundaries. I know a little but more importantly I truly care deeply about this place. I have spent more time in this place than I had in any one place since I was in college. I have joined, in many ways, the ranks of the diaspora (only the opposite way that that term is used).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time, when I first arrived, it seemed like no one really got what the hell was happening down here. See Nairobi is a long way away. And after the 2008 Hargeisa bombings, when pretty much all of the expats left the connections between Hargeisa and Nairobi were even more tenuous. So a disconnect really felt like it developed. Luckily, over the course of the previous year it has &lt;em>felt&lt;/em> like “Nairobi” is starting to get it. I don’t agree with everything I’m hearing coming out of the high level cluster meetings and typical other rumor mill stuff, but I must say that I agree with a lot of it (see, e.g., &lt;a href="http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/mattbaugh/2012/01/1a7/london-conference-on-somalia-building-momentum/" title="London Conference, Building Momentum">this initiative&lt;/a> by the UK’s government).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did not think that a harder military strategy off the coast would reduce piracy. I really felt that a tribunal in Somaliland along with a huge police building effort in Puntland was the best possible shot at fixing things (basically pirate DDR is what needs to happen); I still feel this needs to happen, but the military situation seems to be putting a recent damper on the number of attacks. So they may be right, they may be wrong, but at least they aren’t &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/zA7LWR" title="Somali Pirates Seize 80% Fewer Ships as Early Strikes Work‎">dead wrong&lt;/a>. Not the way they were dead wrong in the early nighties when everyone that knew anything about Somalia would tell you how clearly wrong some of the actions were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nairobi (by which I mean the big money and big – even if distant – powers), seems to be starting to understand two things: there has to be some element of external assistance to stabilize the situation, BUT the Somalis want to have assurances that this isn’t an invasion or their territorial fires start overheating. To do that largely means staying the hell out of the politics BUT also helping to create the conditions of stability long enough for the Somalis to figure out how they will be represented and what the terms are – which can often take months or years – even where you have a majority clan conferences these things take lots of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most Somali analysts are quick to point out that the reason the South cannot seem to fix itself is that the Italians castrated the clan leader system. The problem has been for a long time that no one had the moral authority – among the Southern clans – to stand up to the gangsters that kept hijacking clan resources, state resources, international resources. They just continued to gobble them up like locusts and when they reached an end to their resources they just started gobbling each other. From the early warlord phase into the ICU takeover this is what continued happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a couple of other things were happening also beneath the surface of that. For twenty years there seems to have been an identity crisis within much of the Somali community. This identity, just like lots of things in our lives, runs to the safest place it can find when it is threatened. For most Somalis that is somewhere around one or two or three or four or five clans below the major clan level. It varies by the individual and their experience where this safe place is. One thing I can say for sure, that for most people I’ve met in four years Northerners, Southerners, Easterners and Westerners, for the vast vast percentage of these people that place is no where even close to the pan-Somali level. This is and will for a long time remain the invalidity in the argument that the pan-Somali movement was a viable option without a dictator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even after twenty years Somaliland politicians bicker nearly continuously; lack of trust within Somaliland is rife. The same can be said, only the distrust rises as you go clockwise around the circle.This deep distrust is deep seated in Somali lore going back to way before the mad mullah. By the time you get to Isaaq’s grandsons, they were already fighting with each other. I don’t like all my cousins, but I certainly know I’m not ready to fight with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily the Somalilanders – at the end and often despite this distrust – they make it work. Things haven’t fallen apart here and actually are going pretty well. It has taken a long time to solidify the post-conflict gains and to begin the development phase of their state building, but it is going. And, perhaps more importantly, it is going at a Somali pace. Somaliland really did have to retract after it separated from the South into basically a federated microstate solution. Sure there was a central government created at the Burco conference. But the amount of power and influence of that government was marginal. One cannot compare the power that Silanyo has with the power that Tuur had. The central government was present, but it has taken almost two decades of steady work before anyone gives it any mind about being anything other than a minor inconvenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is another incredibly fascinating thing about being here now, this is the point where the Somaliland Government is really figuring itself and really trying to exert some will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gets us to the microstate solution. In my view, it should be endorsed as it is probably the best viable option currently. Some of the donors seem to be realizing that – as reflected in much of the language coming from the UK as well as the US’s two-track policy shift. In my opinion, the donors need to throttle back the incentives for state capture. When the mandate for the TFG ends UNDP needs to have the political courage to stop paying Parliamentarian salaries, and other than emergency aid the rest of the money flowing into the South needs to end. Then the donors need to let the Somalis work from their grassroots (microstate) levels up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equal with this the Somalis have to take ownership. They really have to stop blaming &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of their problems on the international community and take ownership for their own mistakes. I can fully accept many Somalis gripes about the prior actions of external actors. And I fully understand their paranoia about external interventions in their problems. But equally they have to trust a bit more. And they have to take a lot more ownership. This is, at its most elemental, a Somali problem, and they have to be the ones to figure the solutions out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am cautiously optimistic about London Conference. A lot of the right things appear to being said. We will see what will happen but if the donors really wanted to get to the roots of the problems, they need to just shut up and they need to hold their next conference in a place which is neutral &lt;em>enough&lt;/em> to get all of the important-to-Somalis people under a great big, giant ass tree and then they need to not show up and to not pay. And then let them stay there until they figure it out. It will take a hell of a long time, but it will get done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has taken the fine work of a lot of Somalis and Westerners for the awareness to be sufficiently raised as to why we’re here and what the hell can we do about it. I must say for the first time in a while I’m cautiously optimistic about all of the Somali region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more perspective on the London Conference here are a few articles I thought highly incisive, particularly from the Somaliland view point: &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/zh7Zcm" title="Somaliland and the London Conference on Somalia">Article 1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/z1OXHx" title="Six Elements for Success of Somali Conference in UK">Article 2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Day in My Life: Somaliland Edition</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-01-29-day-in-life-somaliland/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-01-29-day-in-life-somaliland/</guid><description>&lt;p>The other day, my dad asked me to write a short piece about what my daily life is like in Somaliland. I usually refrain from such things, but I think it is a good opportunity to show how &lt;em>normal&lt;/em> everything is here. With a few caveats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Office Guest Suite][2]][2]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I generally awake between 9 and 10. Although this is late for a work day, if you read to the end you’ll see why. Mostly everyone else is out of the office in the morning either in court or meetings or taking care of personal errands. This is great for me, since I’m a slow waker so I like the peacefulness in the mornings as it lets me wake at a reasonable pace. In many ways the afternoons and mornings are sort of flipped around from life in the US. Things start slowly here for almost everyone. Although I used to have my own house that I rented, these days I’m spending less long stretches in Hargeisa and so we have built a sleeping room here at the office for me to use when I’m here and for the team to use after a late night working when I’m not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![][3]][3]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a freezing cold shower that although painful is effective at getting your juices flowing, I head into our office. I share and office with Hassan, my Vice President, but he is rarely there in the mornings. I like to begin my day with a cup of coffee and some news, as many others do. Here that comes in a flask of Ethiopian coffee my watchman brings from our close Ethiopian tin shack shop and accompanied by my scans of my Google Reader (using Feedly’s skin), Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr feeds. I generally do a more or less quick scan in the mornings. I read a few smaller articles from my feeds, but I just generally skim the headlines and then mark the longer articles that seem interesting for my Readability queue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After I’m finished with the news, I then usually begin working on whatever lies in front of me. I usually try to start the working day with the mundane admin tasks that don’t require as much thought as my client work. About 12:30 or 1:00 I’ll realize that I’m hungry and ask my watchman to go bring my lunch. We have a hotel about two blocks away that serves a decently nice chicken sandwich and edible fries (which is my typical lunch order). When I reach a stopping point in my work then I take a small break and migrate into our chewing room. This usually involves several trips to get all of the waste baskets in the office, rearrange the cushions in the room, make sure the tea cups and ashtrays are brought in, and also that all my accoutrement is ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Chewing Session][4]][4]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to eat in the relaxation of the sitting room while listening to either some music or a podcast. The rest of the gang usually arrives somewhere between 2 and 3. Our majlis is almost always open to people if they are interested in coming to chat with us. The only times we ask people not to come are when we have a meeting planned. On a typical afternoon, we’ll have 7 to 10 people with us for varying lengths of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![My Chewing Position][5]][5]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chewing sessions are interesting. You make an effort to prepare your spot so everything you’ll need for the next 6 to 12 hours is within your reach. You make sure that your water, your tea, your soft drinks, your fake beer, your chat, your phone, your computer (and cord), your wallet, keys, everything is just around you. At our office, we developed a habit of using our wastebaskets as small tables for our laptops. It works fantastically as the laptop doesn’t overhead and when you’re sitting on the floor it is at a really good height so your back does not get jarred. Also it is quite easy to move when you are changing the way that you sit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chewing sessions generally start quite festive and then steadily deteriorate into quietness. Everyone usually is chatting at the beginning, or reading some news, or checking their facebook. Then after everyone is more or less settled in they begin work. In many offices, not only ours, the real work takes place at chewing sessions. Although many expats in Hargeisa are very much against qat (for admittedly valid reasons) the argument that it makes people lazy I simply don’t buy. For me, it focuses me and I actually work quite well when I’ve had a normal dosage of qat. The high you get from qat, if one can even call it a high, is very subtle and take a long time to settle in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some people join us but do not have work that day so they will chat or listen to Somali songs or watch TV depending on their moods. The rest of us either put on headphones or we just listen as we are working. It is not unlike a co-working space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The great thing about a chewing session is that when you need a break or if you have a question you just ask or you just visit with people. If something comes on the news people will generally discuss. If there had been a big political incident earlier that day it will get analyzed in detail. And sometimes people will just work or chat on facebook. It is a very relaxed environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually people leave between 9 and 10. At this point in the night, I’m usually getting my best work done and so I will often stay going until about 2 or 3 when I snoozily saunter to the sleeping room. Then the cycle starts all over again. So that’s a typical Somaliland day. With a few pictures.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I was in college my friend Dave and I would often fall asleep at some point during our millionth screening of Braveheart. We would often put the film on after the bars had closed and we had grabbed our drunken treat of the night and were not yet ready for bed. At the time we were training to be Marine officers and very interested in learning what it took to be a good leader. Near the beginning of the film there was a quote which I often thought about (at still think about):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You admire this man, this William Wallace. Uncompromising men are easy to admire. He has courage; so does a dog. But it is exactly the ability to &lt;em>compromise&lt;/em> that makes a man noble. And understand this: Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit on the throne of England. And none of us, and nothing of Scotland will remain, unless &lt;em>we&lt;/em> are as ruthless. Give ear to our nobles. Knowing their minds is the key to the throne.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We would scoff at this quote. In our youth and lack of exposure to the world we felt that uncompromising was the way of the greatest leaders. That may still be true, but I have learned that it definitely is not true of the greatest rulers. Indeed, the greatest rulers are often those that are the greatest to compromise. Human nature being what it is, you will very rarely have complete agreement with a course of action. Multiply the amount of people a decision will affect and you necessarily multiply the different opinions (both rational and irrational) which will impact your decision before it is taken and laud or critique it after it is taken. This is a fundamental “problem” with ruling in a democracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ryan Lizza has written a fantastically interesting piece for The New Yorker. He dives deeply into a trove of memos which circulated the Obama White House during the first term of that administration. He assembles a very interesting piece which does a great job of detailing the tensions that any President may face. I encourage everyone to read it, &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/zTXpzr" title="The Obama Memos">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is interesting for me, given my current diaspora state (relatively torn between Europe, America, and Africa), to compare the political processes which take place in a very new, somewhat inchoate democracy – Somaliland – to a very old, overly complex democracy – the US – while comparing both, which I view as an insider, to the relatively “clean” democratic processes that the Europeans embody. One of the difficult things in an independent executive system, where the governing functions of creating laws and putting those laws into action are separated between two branches of government, is that we tend to blame the “big man” for all of the problems. This happens in Somaliland just as often as it happens in the US. The realities of Presidential campaigns often do a disservice by blurring the lines. Much of the debate during a Presidential campaign revolves around big or small policy ideas that the President will have very little to no control over. As I was telling someone the other day, a President has an ability to stop a legislative action it doesn’t want to allow but it has little ability to make a legislative body do something that that body does not want to do. Yet these big policy ideas are a function of modern politics. Firstly they are easier to discuss than the minutae of what a President really does. Secondly, it is a method of acting somewhat uniformly in our very much decentralized system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, reading the piece shows me what I was hoping to see. A President who has learned how to do what is possibly the most difficult and complex job on the planet. A President who remains willing to make compromises, but also has learned how to work the system. A President who still has standards and struggles to balance a bowing to the political winds with a deep devotion to his ideals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Obama cannot get a large piece of greenhouse gas passed through (right now) domestically, he has floated a ton of money for research, innovation, and implementation of greenhouse reduction initiatives in other countries. While Obama faces complete stonewalling from his own legislators on jobs (right now), he has figured out how to incentivize job growth and business creation in other countries with entrepreneurial grants and collaborative agreements dominating much of the AID/DOS grants I’ve seen lately. While Obama cannot push forward comprehensive immigration reform (right now), he has put in place policies which make it much easier to get US visas (while remaining within the legislative caps mandated by various amendments to the Immigration and Nationalization Act) and illegal immigration flows are down – particularly from Mexico. These are largely international examples for a couple of reasons. First it is my area of interest so I follow it closer. Second the President has fundamentally more power over foreign policy than domestic policy. Third, Hillary – despite how divisive she may or may not be – is a brilliant bureaucrat and many of these initiatives are coming from her shop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No government is perfect, but where the President and his team have a reasonable amount of power I am genuinely pleased with what I see. There’s much to disagree with, but there is much more that I agree with. As we turn towards a full scale assault on us all with respect to choosing our next President one thing I would encourage everyone to do is to not get tricked by the red herrings of advertisements and debates and to focus on what the President can and does actually do on a daily / weekly / monthly / yearly basis. Choose wisely.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We are smack in the middle of a heck of a travelling ten days. Left Chattanooga where we had Christmas for Glasgow where we had New Years via Atlanta (shuttle), London (plane), and Edinburgh (rental car). Then down to L’s farm in Southwest corner of Scotland. Then up to Edinburgh for a nap then to Den Haag via Amsterdam (plane and train). Thursday I trek down to Hargeisa via Zurich, Dubai, and Berbera.&lt;br>
Since I only have a very limited time here in the Hague before I return to Hargeisa, today I had to go get my haircut. I had been in the states for a few months and L wasn’t sure about the state of my hair upon arriving for the Christmas celebrations. The current outlook was grim at any rate. I had purposely delayed getting it cut (and my beard closely trimmed) because I am sometimes incredibly neglgent at life but also because I quite like my Turkish barber here in the Hague.&lt;br>
One thing I am learning about myself is how important patronage is. When I view it through the lens of community formation, patronage becomes exceedingly important to me. The word patron is a funny word. Reconciling medieval notions of artists who had patrons with more modern exclamatories of “don’t patronize me” leaves quite an imterpretive swath. Yet, the patronage I mean I to give someone your business more or less on a regular basis. Sometimes it is an exclusive arrangement; sometimes not. In others words I mean it in the same sense as to become a regular.&lt;br>
Some of the difficulties of living a nomad’s life are eased by assembling small pockets of communities where you are known. But communities, are living things and thereby require engagement in order to survive and to thrive. If you don’t participate in and engage with your communities the linkages between you and them whither. Sometimes it takes an extraordinarily long time for the connections to whither – as I found upon a trip to visit old, grand friends in September after too long apart. Sometimes it doesn’t take long at all for connections to whither – as I found out upon numerous trips to the same Panera where they never once gave me a singular look of recognition.&lt;br>
When the barber was almost ready for me, one of his partners walked in and asked me into his chair. I politely refused the earliest available barber for my guy. My guy speals not a lick of English and I not a lick of Dutch. So we have said very little to one another besides yes / no and some serious sign language. And yet, I feel (perhaps it is one sided) that we have a connection. When I saw me walk in there was a look of recognition on his face. Perhaps he’s just a good actor, but either way it made me feel quite happy to be a known commodity instead of an unknown commodity briefly flitting into and out of existence.&lt;br>
When I first sat in his chair on our first meeting, he looked at my hair for a second, realized I didn’t speak Dutch and then just  grabbed some of my hair indicated a length, I said no, he went shorter, I said yes. That was it until the end when I smiled and rubbed my chin. He used his finger and thumb to indicate short, medium, or long. I said medium with my fingers. Then I gave him the money and went on my way happier for the nice relax and small nap I had gotten while at the barber. Many like to go to their barbers for the news and gossip. I like to go to close my eyes and have a bit of relax. To turn my brain off for a split second. After that first cut, when L saw it, she said it was the best cut I had received in ages. This sealed the deal. So now I am his customer.&lt;br>
I have been a few times since that first time and every time I enjoy the ridiculous Turkish sappy pop songs and the fifties traditional decorating scheme with its marble and glass shelves and perfume bottles and potted plants and overall uptown Manhattan feel circa 1950. But also I get a really great haircut. So now I am willing to get a bit feral in order to wait till I can get back to the Hague to see my barber.&lt;br>
This is a pretty normal way of living ones life it seems to me. Most people I know have a favorite haircutter. It is a funny profession in that way. So universal. It should be known as the fourth or fifth oldest profession. Every community on earth has a barber shop and for a vast majority of the communities the barber shop is a hub of the community. A gathering point for gossip and discussion. A place which did not require the time or effort that a pub required. A place which you never know who you would run into. I like that even if I cannot gossip about who recently married whom at my barber shop, that I can at least walk in and he knows what to do.&lt;br>

So instead of channeling my own rage for the angst and suffering of my friends I am left to watch the list of ‘Praying for you”s grow on a facebook wall. There is no way to reason through it. There is nothing to do. I can put my head in my hands. I can support. And that’s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead, I write this. I write about friendship. Because in aid, unlike in any other industry I know of, you forge friendships which are simply impossible in other worlds. After spending a week with someone laughing at your inability to leave the compound because the threat of terrorists attacks is too high (even for risk takers from small NGOs). After drinking yourself stupid after the most vicious of weeks imaginable. After chuckling at the little absurdities and cultural incongruities. After talking politics of a country not your own. After vacationing to the most beautiful little tucked away shitholes in the world. After wine at sunset. And dogs at dusk. After making bread, and canning peppers, and christmas dinner for all you know together. After these and a million other memories which you cherish for the rest of your life. You come to know people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no thoughts which are greater than this. I have been unable to think today. My thoughts are in a place far from here. My brain is non-existent. And I wait. And I hope. And maybe, just maybe, for the first time in a long time. I pray.&lt;/p>

That&amp;#8217;s What I&amp;#8217;ve Been Waiting For.</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-09-09-the-preacher-is-back-thats-what-ive-been-waiting-for/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-09-09-the-preacher-is-back-thats-what-ive-been-waiting-for/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just finished watching the jobs speech and my first thought was “were have you been”? The historian-poet-preacher in him which I fell in love with in the Yes We Can and Race speeches (collectively rather than individually) had found his groove tonight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every artist struggles with finding their artistic voice, but for me, at this moment, this was balm to my soul. Someone, somewhere, does actually get it. But before I get to what I liked about the speech let me take a small detour and talk about how I think about my relationship between me and my government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m currently staying at my brother’s, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/kuhlman">@kuhlman&lt;/a>, house and he has a great dane. Due to our pomo lives we missed each other. He is off on a construction job overnight and I just returned from an overnight job myself. We missed each other and were not able to pass a key back and forth. When we were texting each other as to our current statuses and how we could coordinate this changeover, I asked him whether the house was locked. He responded, “Maggie’s the lock.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now Maggie is a wonderful bitch (which I mean literally). This bitch has a bark that will tear your hair off when she gets scared. I have no idea whether she has the bite to match it, and I like that I don’t know that, because her bark is scary enough. She is the perfect lock. See locks are on-off switches. But living, breathing beings are able to differentiate between when on is OK and off is OK. Sometimes the best lock is the one that can differentiate between when to bark and when to be happy because your friend is here to let you out to go take a piss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this is how I want my government to be. I don’t want to rely on my government unnecessarily. I understand that my successes and my failures are my own. But sometimes you want to know that if you are forced, due to the situations of living your life, to deviate from your normal patterns, that there will be a being there to have your back. You don’t want something that is impersonal and cannot differentiate between friend and foe. You want a bitch there that is both happy to see you and happy to go have a poo in the yard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That story said, there were many things that I loved about the Obama speech.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, he chastised both sides. He told some hard truths. These words were his preacher robes which I have not seen him don for a long, long time. Too long. And it was needed. Both sides of the political aisle have been being babies for a while now and the only people suffering are the middle class of America. This &lt;em>must&lt;/em> change. The only way to get shit done is to sometimes put aside the differences and realize that the betterment of the country is at stake. Since I’ve spent so much time in African countries where politics is so personality based I am especially receptive to the in-out-group mechanisms which operate in such an environment. And if you want to actually help, if you want to get something done in this world you’re going to have to figure out a compromise. Because, as the President of the United States, said “No single individual built America on their own. We built it together. .” What a great line. Sometimes we have to act as a community. Individualism is great, but no one at no time has EVER acted completely in isolation as an individual. We call those beings the last creature of their species. What is required, from time to time, is looking out for those that may not be as smart, or have the opportunities, or whatever as we fancy of ourselves. And in that vein, next week I hope to go pound some nails to help members of my family’s community who were affected by the tornadoes earlier this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, it was perhaps the most patriotic speech which has been given during my lifetime. It was a call to action. It was competitive (which we Americans love). It told us that there was going to be some hard days ahead. This was the poet that I’ve been longing for. This was the inspiration that I’ve been hoping for. This was the America that I have studied and that I love. Just turn off your brain (I’ll get to the wonky stuff in a moment) and listen to the words of his speech and tell me that you are not inspired by &lt;em>something&lt;/em>, or even &lt;em>anything&lt;/em> in this speech. No matter your political affiliation this man gets that he was “hired” to execute the laws in the best interest of us all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, it cut through all the bullshit, stupid rhetoric which neither matters nor helps. He has learned from his own failures to properly leverage both the power of his position and the wave of people power which put him in that chair. This was a pragmatic speech to its core. What he said is exactly, *exactly, *what economists have proven matter for the economic development of your country. There are many opinions as to the best, but almost every economist will agree that what is necessary for economic development (this comes from my international development perspective) is: infrastructure, education, jobs for low-skilled individuals, and healthcare. We’ll leave aside for now the reasons why each of these exist. Similarly I’m going to take a mulligan on healthcare because I don’t have the energy to enter that debate as to why people that don’t have millions in the bank don’t *deserve *to not feel awful all the time, but if you care about that watch Sicko and shutup. But see here’s the thing. Our schools are falling apart. While we prosecute irrational wars overseas (which I’ve participated in and have some modicum of epistemic authority here), we’re not able to give the support that our teachers require to educate our children. Our infrastructure is subpar. Visit Europe and try to convince me that we are still number one. Drill, Baby, Drill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this is a short review, but my early take (before reading any punditry) is that it was brilliant and one of Obama’s best performances. On a personal level I’m happy for three reasons: (1) the poet I wanted is finding his voice, (2) the pragmatist we all need is finally leveraging his platform, and (3) the wonk in me is reassured that someone up there will bark when necessary and greet when necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were many great moments of this speech for me. But the one that stands out. The one that I will think of tomorrow. Is this.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No single individual built America on their own. We built it together. We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another. Members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What did you think of the speech?&lt;/p>

While I was getting ready for work my phone was streaming an album which I found last night to be ultra-enjoyable. My headphones were with me; so, I plugged them into the phone and started walking. Got to work; sat down at my desk computer to type this; the album is still playing. Seamlessly it has flown to my ears via 4G wireless and .11n wireless. I have not purchased this album, but I’m going to see the band in about 10 days if I’m able.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is our wonderful, vibrant, modern world. Where pop music is crowd-sourced and GOOD. No more do we need to rely on corporate people with obvious biases and conflicting inclinations, torn between their artistic roots and boardroom future, who push out to the masses bubblegum crap. These days bubblegum crap still does OK, but nothing like it did in the 90′s. These days, if you don’t have a real soul, if you lack authenticity, you are less likely to “make” it than in the past. I listened to a Moth podcast by one of the Milli Vanilli guys earlier this week who was talking about how things went down for them. I cannot even imagine that happening. Even the corporate music world (I think) understands that it takes more than a pretty face, great hair, and an ability to dance to make it. Unless you want to be a dancer – which you can. I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you wanted to impress a girl you brought her over, and if she was artsy you figured out a way to let her see your music collection. CDs organized on metal or wooden racks prominently displayed in your room. This is how it was done for decades. Because as was said in High Fidelity, “music, art, television, these things matter, they connect us.” It was a shorthand way to tell her your story in a really interesting way. The tingles of “ohhhhhh, I looooooove this album” and you knew that you had made a connection. Those things were real. Although we are losing the physical objects, it seems to me that the social interaction portion is still very much alive and well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we get to spotify. My friend Frank sent me an invite a couple of weeks ago, and I must say it is only alright if you don’t pay. But then I said let me try their pay service. And a whole new world opened up. It is unbelievable. They have figured out the perfect marriage of a huge library, vibrant community of humans I actually know, along with all my music. What I love about it, is that to be cool on spotify doesn’t matter how big your record collection is, because everyone is operating on the same exact set of tunes. It doesn’t matter if you are a rich person who can afford to spend hundreds on tons of new CD’s or if you are dirt poor and just want to listen to great stuff. You both are operating on the same pay model and have access to the same stuff. We Americans love our individuality and there is something to be said for that, but the Europeans have gone much further than we have in figuring out how to manage communities by sharing. So what &lt;em>does&lt;/em> matter on Spotify. I’m not sure as I’m really new to the community, but I suspect what really matters is not the size or breadth of the money that you have spent on albums but on what you have put together, what you have created, mashed up, and collated. It is is your playlists idiot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s how I’m going to judge you in our amazing, cloudy, pomo world. Have a great day everyone, find some good art, enjoy the hell out of it, smile at your neighbors and dance for no reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you want to know what album I was loving, check out this band.&lt;/p>

If I had to title the alteration, I would call it An Homage to Motherhood&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a bit random in nature, but it is a compilation of some sources and commentary and thought. So think of it as more of a collage than a strict narrative. Much of this was originally posted on &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/nunfsy" title="Original Post">Google &lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thought-1-early-warning-systems-worked">Thought 1: Early Warning Systems Worked&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We’ve known this was coming for well over six months. According to &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r1eFZk">here&lt;/a>, it has been well known since November 2010 which seems about right to me. Those that are paid to do handle these things were trying their best (more on that in a minute) to address the situation but were unable to deliver the food aid at that time. There’s little to suggest that anything has changed in the interim and delivery of the aid will somehow be magically easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Up here in Somaliland we were taking bucket showers as early as March of this year. Although it does take a while to get to the point where there is a certified famine (due to a strict criteria to certify a disaster/drought as a famine), all of the early warning systems worked. The rains ended up coming for Somaliland, but they did not come (until a couple of weeks ago, and way too late for the livestock and vegetables) for the South. Yet in Somaliland the Government took a lot of steps to ease the suffering of the pastoralists and farmers in their territory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amaryta Sen is famous for saying that all famines are avoidable failures of governments. Somaliland’s government passed that test. Ministers were out escorting water tankers into the country-side, TV shows on water conservation were aired on national television (not that Somalis need these lessons, but anyway), and mostly it was a local re-distribution effort rather than an international aid effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is an impossible hypothetical what would have happened if the rains had not come to Somaliland. Yet, I suspect that the efforts would have been decently well-thought out and executed as a community. All of it would have been led by Somalis with the international community playing a supporting role, as it should be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thought-2-extent-of-suffering">Thought 2: Extent of Suffering&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The famine is confined to two regions of very Southern Somalia which are sparsely populated to begin with. Although millions are at risk, it isn’t millions that are actually suffering. This isn’t meant to minimize the suffering of those that are suffering, it is simply to bring some perspective. I’m not cynical, how can you be when you look at pictures like &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/qYLsnF" title="mourning at the grave of a 3 y/o">this&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coincidentally, these are the same areas where al-Shabaab has a very strong control over the population. One picture that has certainly caught my eye is of a Shabaab soldier with rows and rows of squatting women behind him looking distraught. The photographer obviously focused on the warrior, but the women in the background are the stars of the shot for me. It is a soberingly iconic reminder of what is really going on. See the picture &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/q5CAfm" title="shabaab soldier and women">here&lt;/a>, and look close.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shabaab has been playing both sides of this issue. First they banned nearly every aid agency from working in their zones. This was a long time ago, and ironically enough when I’ve been in Nairobi talking to people who work in the South they were telling me that the (non-Somali) agencies which were allowed to continue working were faith-based organizations like &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/nhch7c">World Vision&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r07JSt">ADRA&lt;/a>. Mostly these organizations were headed by one or at most two Kenyans and largely they were left alone to do their work, except for one young aid worker I heard about who was killed by Shabaab for proselytizing. We may feel bad for the man’s family, but it was a bit of &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/n2KAxP">Darwinism&lt;/a> at work if you ask me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thought-3-aid-agencydysfunctionalism--restrictions">Thought 3: Aid Agency Dysfunctionalism &amp;amp; Restrictions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>WFP-Somalia is, for those of us that have been in/worked on Somalia for more than 30 seconds, about the &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oomANF">most&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/n58Y82">dysfunctional&lt;/a>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oqX8Y5"> organization&lt;/a>. I have serious doubts that the increases in aid will end up as food in bellies – except for (maybe) those that are working in Daadab where it is a bit more straight-forward to deliver and where there is some semblance of oversight. Also there are fundamental structural problems with the way aid agencies (including NGOs and UN organs) are built and work. See &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/p7M6aZ">here&lt;/a> for a great discussion of this (but rather technical if you’re not into the biz of aid/development). The summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In summary, a major reason why aid agency presence has not translated into reduced vulnerability to, for example, famine, is due to aid agencies not being geared to do just that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Aid agencies do not build their programs around context, but are influenced by donor interest, assumptions, internal capacity and their own models of approach.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aid agencies don’t have resources that can be quickly tasked from one mode of operation (development) to another (emergency response).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aid agencies’ internal measuring systems do not hold them accountable to how well they reduce the risk of a disaster happening, only on how well they acheive project deliverables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And aid agencies own internal systems and staffing do not allow a seamless transition from a long-term development presence to an emergency response.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes, the international community has made many mistakes. But I do not believe that it is the role of the international community to lead at times like this. I strongly believe that the role of the international community is to support local efforts with materiale, technical assistance, logistics expertise, and funding. I am disheartened by the increasing frequency of calls for an intervention on the level of the 92/93 intervention which burst the New World Order bubble and ushered in a decade of UN futility as the world’s largest NGO body of political discourse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though it is true that the international community, US, UK, Italy, etc. are definitely not without fault, I’m terribly tired of the narrative which places the entirety of the blame on these external parties. An example is here, where there is an entire, well written &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/quvuzF">post&lt;/a> by an educated Somali without the smallest hint of acceptance for any responsibility by the Somali community for what is happening (other than a few “criminals”). Here’s the crux of his argument.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If we had had foresight and acted upon it; if the Marines had disarmed the warlords; if the U.N. Security Council had issued arrest warrants for the warlords early on, stopping them from prolonging the failure of the state; if the Security Council had dealt with the warlords — who had denied starving millions access to food — speedily and decisively, in the same way it dealt with the genocidal regimes in Serbia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan, then al-Qaeda would not have established a secure base from which to plan terrorist attacks. Our country would not have been hamstrung by the enormity of our problem, nor would it have become the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A friend on G asked me a good question:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I would be interested if anybody knows some more details on the reason Al-Shabab has refused to let the aid organisations in. I mean, no matter what they publicly say, I am sure they feel the pressure of famine too. So why is it not possible to find some kind of middle ground? Are the NGOs reluctant to give up control over food deliveries? If yes, is that justified? &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/p3m5eU" title="Peter Dorrie on Google Plus">~Peter Dorrie&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My answer was that that’s part of it. Another big part of it is donor restrictions on supporting terrorist organizations. It is difficult to say with any certainty what Shabaab’s position is as they are terribly decentralized and non-uniform. Their position isn’t terribly rational but it is basically isolationist (like N.Korea, Taliban, Myanmar, etc.). They came to power on an anti-invaders platform and largely have kept to that meme throughout. On top of their irrationalities on banning bras, samosas, music, and anything that is fun, the group is funadamentally more nationalistic than it is Islamist (which is why I have always questioned the depth of their linkages with an Arab-led organization like Al-Qaeda).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are other things in play. According to &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/rpMQUy">this&lt;/a> article which examines this in a bit more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The first point I would make is that al Shabab is minimizing the crisis because, as many observers and experts are saying, the movement itself likely made the famine worse. Famines often (always?) result not only from failed rains or population growth, but also government policies, especially denial and inaction. . . . Every indication points to the conclusion that al Shabab not only fit into this regional trend [of refusing to recognize or limiting acknowledgement of the extent of a drought/famine because it highlights the ruling organization's shortcomings or racism], but was – because of its limited resources, its preoccupation with the civil war, and its ideology – a particularly bad offender.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My second thought is that when looking at al Shabab’s hostility to outsiders, it is worthwhile to try to understand the movement’s thinking from the inside. . . . The movement is made up mostly of young men (its name, after all, is Arabic for “the youth”), many of whom were children, or were not even born yet, when the Somali state collapsed in 1991. They have only known war and instability. They have seen weak would-be central governments come and go, they have seen clan rivalry tear at the social and political fabric of the country, and they have seen a parade of external actors, some of whom, like Ethiopia when it occupied Somalia from late 2006 to early 2009, carried out massive violence. Growing up in that environment would brutalize many people and make them deeply suspicious of outsiders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the famine strikes directly at the relationship between al Shabab and its constituents. The movement is taking a huge risk if it tries to solve this problem through violence and denial. Al Shabab controls territory, and so it must have some local support – support that is likely based in large part on al Shabab’s ability to offer some security and stability after years of fighting. Allowing the famine to go unchecked could destroy whatever local legitimacy al Shabab possesses, potentially resulting in infighting, fragmentation, rebellions, or desertions. From this perspective, it is not difficult to see why al Shabab originally decided to re-admit external aid agencies. And yet it now seems that paranoia and suspicion of outsiders are winning out in the leadership’s thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For an aid worker’s perception of this see &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r9qxK6">this&lt;/a> great article by &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pUP9XF">@morealtitude&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An invitation from al Shabbab central command may sound like a good enough reason to think aid workers would be safe re-entering south-central, but in fact it isn’t. Like many insurgency groups, al Shabbab is as much a network of affiliated warlords as it is a hierarchical paramilitary organization. Fighters on the ground- the ones with guns, grenades and IEDs- will align themselves first with their local commander, and only after that with al Shabbab central. Then there’s the assumption that the message is even getting down to those field grunts and their captains. Or the notion that some 16-year-old with an AKM, who’s never been to school but has spent the last ten years being told that westerners are pillaging his country and deserve to die, will pay any attention to some recent order from someone he’s never heard, when he sees an NGO Land Cruiser drive past.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="thought-4-the-role-of-somalis">Thought 4: The Role of Somalis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Through all that I’ve read, I am most heartened by the diaspora involvement. Pull up &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oIgTvU">#feedsomalia&lt;/a> and you’ll see lots of activity. New, caring diaspora members are increasing their networks and ability to influence. This is a long-term positive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the immediate causes of the crisis have been the drought and insecurity in the south, there is something more fundamental at play here. &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/rdLcUg">This&lt;/a> article digs a bit beyond the boilerplate rhetoric.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Drought is not a new environmental condition for much of Africa but a recurring one. The semi-arid Horn of Africa and the entire Sahelian region — running just south of the Sahara Desert across the continent — have long experienced erratic rainfall. While climate change may be exacerbating rainfall variability, traditional livelihoods in the region are adaptable to deal with situations when rainfall is not dependable. . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditionally, herders ranged widely across the landscape in search of better pasture, focusing on areas as meteorological conditions dictated. The approach worked because, unlike fenced-in pastures in North America, it was incredibly flexible and adapted to variable rainfall. As farming has expanded, including in some instances to large-scale commercial farms, the routes of herders have become more concentrated and more vulnerable to drought. [Note, the conflict between the pastoralists and agriculturalists is one of the many, many causes of insecurity in the south.] . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as death from exposure is not an inherent result of a cold winter, famine is not a natural consequence of drought. Simply put, the structure of human society often determines who is affected and to what degree.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Fundamentally, the core of the problem is a breakdown of the social redistribution networks which are a basis of Somali culture (see Somaliland’s reaction described above). The diaspora &lt;em>should&lt;/em> be taking the lead, as they are much closer to the realities of the situation than the US Representative for Somalia (we don’t have an ambassador any longer) is to the situation. The more Somali community leaders take charge, accept the situation, and work towards a solution – the faster the entire situation (meaning more than the famine which is temporary) will stabilize and improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more on the diaspora’s efforts, see &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/n5pN4r">here&lt;/a> (among other &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oIgTvU">places&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thought-6-starvation-porn">Thought 6: Starvation Porn&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/prWxac">Poverty/Starvation Porn&lt;/a> is very real and am happy that it is being talked about outside of the echo chamber of the “aid bloggers/tweeters” (for lack of a better label). There have been some great &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/om4GAY">articles&lt;/a> which have challenged the ethics of this type of coverage, which have come out of the situation. Here’s his punch-line:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Because it’s a cycle. African governments know that drought is coming and they don’t prepare. Foreign charities working there talk about long-term plans to help people become self-sufficient but they’ve been failing to achieve them for 20 years. It’s as much about politics and war and poor economic policies as it is about no rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m no expert but I know that much. I also know it’s wrong that every few years we’re faced with an “emergency” that could have been prevented, that aid groups must frantically try to raise money to respond to, that journalists need to find emaciated babies at death’s door and film and photograph and write about them before the world gives a damn.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>While there &lt;em>is some&lt;/em> value in showing the extent of suffering, it definitely skews the situation. While that is great marketing for aid organizations, as most of us who have worked in the developing world intuitively understand increases in aid flows do not necessarily end up as food in bellies or kids’ butts on school benches. As Haiti and Japan have shown there is an absorptive capacity formula to disaster relief whereby increases in aid can end up resulting in more rotten food or spoiled medicines rather than where it was intended. As &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/njzSQL">this&lt;/a> post from a former World Vision worker puts it, “Poverty is not an image, or a statistic; poverty has a face, a name and a story.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, most aid workers are quick to admit that there is a dualism to poverty porn as am sure they are quite happy with what they get in their bank account at the end of the month (and largely it is money that is well deserved as this is very hard work). But it is not easy to see what you’re working on cheapened by skewed coverage. Some of the ads for help, in particular the one on the Tumblr dashboard (can’t upload screenshot for some reason but at least the kids in the photo are smiling).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An aid worker / blogger who I have lots of respect for has put it this way in &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/p7M6aZ">this article&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Articles are starting to look like a fill-the-blanks template that the reporters are all sharing around: Quote some stats about the famine; talk about the complicating factor of al Shabbab making life difficult in Somalia; drop in some pithy quotes about the fact that short-term aid is repetitive and doesn’t solve the underlying problems (always with a nod to the fact that, well, of course it saves lives now); then end on the dark yet hopeful twist that while aid agencies clearly don’t have it right, clearly what’s needed is ‘long-term solutions’. Yeah, cool, thanks. . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what I’m really ratty about is not that what the media are saying is wrong &lt;em>per se&lt;/em>. My problem is, they’re making noise but missing the point. . . . [Point 1] By rabbiting on about long-term solutions (I’m sorry, what solutions did you suggest, exactly?), they make it sound like nobody’s ever come up with that idea before. . . . Point two is, these solutions aren’t simple in the real-world.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="thought-7-what-can-be-done--what-can-you-do">Thought 7: What Can Be Done / What Can You Do&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Military intervention is about the worst solution human minds could conjure. History should be a lesson here. Somalis are phenomenal at skewing international interventions intended to help as invasions of their sovereignty. And in general Somalis are pretty duplicitous as to outsiders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second worst idea to me is trying to deliver via trucks and ground workers within the Shabaab zones. I fundamentally disagree that the US Gov should “work with Shabaab” as &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r1eFZk">this&lt;/a> article by Richard Dowden of the Royal African Society argues. This is a golden opportunity for the Somalis to see the results of their acquiescence to Shabaab’s presence. The easiest thing one can learn from Somali history is that when they’re sick of you they’ll find a way to overthrow you. When the communities within the Shabaab zones get sick of them they will kick them out of those communities and I know if I was living in these communities I would certainly be pretty circumspect about Shabaab. Of course no one wants to stay “starve them out” as that is cruel and inhumane treatment, but delivery within Shabaab’s areas I am 64.8% sure will end in a worse situation than never going in. As &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pUP9XF">@morealtitude&lt;/a> put it &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r9qxK6">here&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Letting aid workers in solves many problems for al Shabbab. It demonstrates to its own people that it’s taking steps to solve the problem. It helps slow the outflux of refugees. It brings in resources that bolster the population- which may be appropriated by fighters at times, or the effects may be indirect, such as more money in the economy that supports fighters’ families which in turn supports them. And, if aid agencies don’t do the right thing by al Shabbab, it gives them fresh ammunition in the polarizing of its people against the west.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Not increasing aid at all within Somalia is the best possible solution in my mind. The best option within Somalia is to stay out of the diaspora’s way with respect to their remittance flows into Somalia so people can purchase from local markets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was talking the other day with a few friends who work in this area. They told me that the real heart-break is that after people have trekked to the refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia they are finding that the food isn’t there. In these refugee camps there is a host government who is not impeding the delivery of aid and there is a relatively well-trekked cow-path for the logisticians to follow. Increasing the flows to these areas is a relatively straight-forward process and will ease one of the main problems while staying away from the quagmire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next best options are to work through Somali NGOs and increase the flows that they are delivering, continue and maybe increase the &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r7VE6P">air drops&lt;/a> (although these have to be terribly costly from a utilitarian point of view, and finally increase more traditional types of delivery within Mogadishu which the TFG / AMISOM troop relatively control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to give here are some organizations (in the order I would give to them if I had disposable income and wasn’t already fully invested in Somalis):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/qdaZLT">MSF&lt;/a> (Doctors without Borders who provide extensive medical care in the refugee camps)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/rgGS3S">Save the Children&lt;/a> (who have been working in the camps since the beginning)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/ojJQ0R">OXFAM-AUS&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/qCEFxc">OXFAM-UK&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/n7LClH">OXFAM-US&lt;/a> (Who also provides water and other services in the camps)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pfIBe4">IRC&lt;/a> (Who provides a number of services within the refugee camps)&lt;/li>

The first post in the series, the introduction is available &lt;a href="http://www.caseykuhlman.com/entry/somalilands-recognition-journey" title="What Does it Mean to be Independent: Somaliland’s Recognition Journey">here&lt;/a>. One of the legal criteria for statehood is established borders. There is a serious and very well, although often, hidden question as to where Somaliland’s borders are. In this post I try to parse this a bit mainly from the perspective of international law, but also from the political perspective as well.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend, and fellow Somaliland voyeur, Rudie made some very interesting and important points in the comments to my previous point. One of which was:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The AU for instance has a declared policy that colonial borders will be the norm for independence. I think this was to prevent states splitting up in small tribal entities. That would create chaos due to the haphazard way in which colonial borders were drawn with no respect for tribal territories, dividing tribes between countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But before I get to that point of policy, let me put on my lawyer hat for a second (which looks amazing like a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/compleatang">cowboy hat&lt;/a> when you live in an anarchical state).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-international-criteria-for-statehood">The International Criteria for Statehood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are clearly defined baseline criteria for a state to be considered a state under international law. The first is a definable population; the second is a definable territory; the third is a government; and the fourth is the capacity to enter relations with other states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three of these criteria were first stated in the book, Allgemeine Staatslehre (General Theory of the State), published in 1900 by Georg Jellinek  which would put them in the classification of international law of “opinions of reknowned jurists” (which is the layman’s term, it has an official term from the Vienna Convention but I’m too lazy to look it up). This is a law classification and can easily be trumped or changed by higher classifications of international law which conflict with the opinions. However, as with much of international law (and indeed, with law in general) the opinions of jurists form and shape the “real” (known to lawyers as “positive”) law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what happened was later, in 1933, a regional treaty was passed which took into account the three criteria which were originally stated by Jellinek. was the &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pjgrt0">Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States&lt;/a>, which was a treaty concluded by the Organization of American States. Since that time, these four baseline criteria have become so well understood and highly utilized that they have allegedly become fully integrated into international law and adopted by most of the world’s states. Article 1 of that convention state the four criteria listed above.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="montevideo-criteria-2definableterritory">Montevideo Criteria #2: Definable territory.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I must say, when I was doing some quick background research for this post that I learned something. The criteria for borders is less stringent than I originally thought. At least legally speaking. What the International Court of Justice (the World’s Supreme Court for matters such as these), requires is that there be a core territory (see North Sea Case, p. 32, para. 46). If there is a region of the territory which is disputed that is not a hindrance to statehood (see German Gas v. Poland, 5 A.D. 11 at 15). At least legally speaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I keep saying, “at least legally speaking” for a reason. Here’s the bottom line, just because a geographic area meets the criteria for statehood, does not mean that recognition is automatic. Why? Politics. Politics and law are very often intertwined (for they are two sides of the same coin). There is likely no major sector of law where politics are more intertwined than they are with international law. And even within international law, there is perhaps no norm where politics and law are &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/nBwhVz">more intertwined&lt;/a> than when it comes to recognition.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="politics-lens-1-the-african-unions-declaration-of-respect-for-colonial-borders">Politics Lens #1: The African Union’s Declaration of Respect for Colonial Borders&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the 1960′s the US wasn’t the only territory worried about domino’s falling. The rapidly gaining independence African states were also worried about this. For those who may not fully understand African politics, let me simplify most African states are arbitrary maps on lines which were negotiated far from the ground itself. Largely there are two effect to this: (1) people who identify in very different ways have been haphazardly lumped together for no logical reason other than they traditionally resided near one another, and (2) people who identify in very similar ways have often been separated by international borders which they were given no part in making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are not small problems. They are still causing many, many problems throughout the continent. No matter the problems, the AU made a declaration long ago which basically froze the borders the way they were at the end of the colonial period. Why? Hard to say completely, but I suspect it was a devil you know v. devil you don’t know situation. At the end of the day there was a slippery slope argument that the politicians had to quelch. If one tribe, clan, or nation was given its independence within the colonial borders, the massive number of self-identifying entities within Africa would have demanded similar treatment and chaos would have ensued. Or so goes the theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time the AU has tightly held this norm. South Sudan challenges this norm directly as it is the first state within Africa which very clearly violates this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="politics-lens-2-outsourcing-decisions-to-the-african-union">Politics Lens #2: Outsourcing Decisions to the African Union&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Quite a while ago now, both the US and the UK, publicly stated that they would follow the AU’s lead when it came to Somaliland. Before I came here I thought this was a good thing. It represented to me, at that time, that the US and the UK were forcing the AU to act like a grown up regional organization and would allow it to take the diplomatic lead on this issue. Publicly at least, I have seen no retraction as to this policy – as applied to the Somaliland situation.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="factual-lens-1-borders-from-the-somaliland-perspective">Factual Lens #1: Borders from the Somaliland Perspective&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Somalilanders feel very strongly that they meet the Montevideo Criteria #2 without violating the AU’s declaration of respect for colonial borders. Remember Somaliland was a sovereign nation for five days in 1960 (ironically enough, the first state to recognize them during that era was Israel). So Somalilanders say, we have defined borders. And they are the borders of the Somaliland Colony (or Protectorate, which Rudie challenged me on and I haven’t yet had a chance to dig up the answer from my history books here at the office). Case shut.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="factual-lens-2-borders-from-the-puntland-perspective">Factual Lens #2: Borders from the Puntland Perspective&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don’t really know if there is a legal basis to Puntland’s argument, but Puntland does claim the far eastern regions of Somaliland as belonging to it. The border (as Somalilanders see it) does indeed run straight through the middle of a major Somali clan’s traditional homeland, so Puntland’s argument makes sense from a socio-cultural perspective, but I am not sure what their legal basis is. This divergence of opinion is the source of border scuffles which ebb and flow still.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This disputed region, according to the ICJ, does not hinder Somaliland’s statehood quest. At least legally. I suspect, it is a very real world hindrance. Why? One word. Eritrea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eritrea’s “break-away” from Ethiopia in the early 1990′s was not dissimilar to what Somaliland needs to accomplish. It was a unification that went awry and the break-away state wanted to reinstate its borders upon independence. The problem was that no one really knew where the border was and Ethiopia and Eritrea ended up fighting a semi-protracted war over the region which required the international community to come in, clean it up, and keep the peace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, the borders are very likely a very real thing in the minds of diplomats sitting at desks in Nairobi and Addis writing their home governments analysis memos about Somaliland’s recognition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, the Somaliland army does occupy almost the entirety of the territory. It doesn’t really control it, but it’s there and it’s doing the best it can with what little resources it has. The problem isn’t really from the Somaliland-Puntland perspective as much as it is from the perspective of the local people. Many of whom put up Puntland flags in their houses and claim to “not know Somaliland.” Somaliland has literally bent over backwards, giving portions of the governance sector way out of per capita proportions to clans from the East. It has attempted, when it can, to sink money into the East. It is actively encouraging development and aid agencies not only to work in the “triangle” but to also work further east. At the end of the day, the area we’re talking about would make Deadwood look like modern Stockholm in comparison. It is L A W L E S S. See &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oYVYij">here&lt;/a> for news from this week about what happens in this area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I have heard Somalilanders often claim that if recognition comes to Somaliland that the eastern clans would “come around” and support Somaliland. Behind close doors, in the majlises that I visit and sit with Somalilanders, most readily admit that it isn’t that simple. The eastern clans have traditionally been among the rules of Somalis overall. One of their major clans has a long a history of being politicians as the Isaaqs (Somaliland’s far-majority clan) have of being traders and business people. Another of their major clans was the clan of the former dictator, Siad Barre. So it isn’t quite a simple matter for them to subservient themselves to the Isaaq. Puntland (where the same clans which are in eastern Somaliland completely occupy), if it were to become a sovereign nation, would be in an awful position resource-wise. They have &lt;em>very&lt;/em> little resources to speak of. The areas they claim in Somaliland are said to be decent (if not great) grazing areas and are said to have a decent amount of minerals including perhaps hydrocarbon deposits. So it isn’t a simple matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was talking with a friend on Thursday about this issue and basically we could agree that the area is likely more trouble than it is worth. So I posited why doesn’t the President just cede the area to Puntland and let them deal with the problems. After it left my mouth I realized instantly why Somaliland can never do that: they would then be rewriting the colonial borders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where the South Sudan precedent may be of assistance to Somaliland. If the AU either restricts or abolishes its declaration of respect for colonial borders, or at a minimum creates some exceptions, then Somaliland could potentially allow the area to go to Puntland and still argue that it meets the criteria for statehood. That is incredibly far-fetched I know, but it could be an option at least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Up next: population&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After having been in Somaliland, one of the world’s most advanced unrecognized countries, for well over three years I have thought much about what it means to be a state, to have your independence, to maintain your sovereignty and many related issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, Somaliland’s history breaks down like this. Somaliland (now) was known before as British Somaliland and as any astute reader may be able to understand from the glaring connotations it was a British colony. What is now the rest of Somalia (known together as Puntland and South-Central for those of us who work on and/or live in the territory of the former Republic of Somalia) was at the same time known as Italian Somaliland. In 1960 when independence movements were sweeping the world (in the US we just called them the civil rights movements, in Africa they were “real” independence movements), Both of the former colonies received their independence within 5 days of each other in the summer of 1960. British Somaliland was a stand-alone entity for five days, afterward it formed a union with the former Italian colony based upon the notion that all five of the Somali areas (modern-day Djibouti, eastern Ethiopia, Somaliland, the former Italian colony, and the North-Eastern part of Kenya) would unite to form a republic for the Somali people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things didn’t end up turning out as the Somali elites at the time had hoped. The French did not give up Djibouti until much later. Ethiopia and Kenya were worried about their hetergenous populaces and if they allowed the Somalis to break away each of the tribes or nations within their countries would demand similar treatment. The US wasn’t the only one in the 1960′s worried about Domino Effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Northerners (formerly British Somalilanders, who currently identify as Somalilanders), though leading the push for unification with the South were mismatched and could not compete for their pro rata places throughout the elite of Somali society. They ended up being dominated in almost every facets of country-wide politics by (to them) outsiders and they were not given the opportunity to participate properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a long series of events the Northerners formed a rebel group in the mid- / late-1980s (depending on how you classify “formed”) which was called the Somali National Movement. It was dominated by Northern elites, but its stated purpose was to overthrow the dictator of the time, Siad Barre. Again things did not turn out as the elites expected. The populace of the Northern tribes, after the SNM drove Siad’s forces (mostly) out of their region demanded that SNM “reinstate” the independence which the Northerners had gained when the British lowered their flags. The SNM leadership, reliant upon cash from the diaspora and the support of the local people for the continuation of their campaign against Siad, had no choice and complied with the demands of the people and “reinstate” their independence (alternatively known locally as “retract the unity with the south” or “declared independence”). That was 1991.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since 1991, Somalilanders have done an amazing amount. They have developed a tri-partite governance system based upon a US model of independent executive with a bicameral legislature. They have a flag, currency, a national anthem, customs officials, defined borders, national monuments, and every other outward hallmark of a state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But yet they have not been recognized as an independent, sovereign state by any entity in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pxvnYK">South Sudan&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/rrYYLM">Libyan rebels&lt;/a> are being recognized by states and international organizations all over the world. Which begs the question why has this bastion of democracy and stability in an area much better known for pirates, terrorists, war lords, and downed helicopters not been given the diplomatic support of the “international community”?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those fresh off the planes to Egal International Airport in Hargeisa will often ask that question to their drivers, fixers, or staff directly. And they answers they receive vary from Nile politics, to Jewish conspiracies, to cynical disenfranchisement. My own thoughts differ from all of those theories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First the Libyan rebels situation is different, as explained in the link referenced above. This consortium of disparate groups is not trying to separate and form a new, unique republic but is trying to take over the entire country and overthrow a dictator (not dissimilar to the SNM’s original mission). The recognition given by the US, UK, French, and other big players in world politics is simply a recognition that they are the valid governing coalition for the entire geographical area and have the right to speak on behalf of the entire Libyan people. This shift from Qaddafi regime to the rebel regime is not terribly different than the diplomatic maneuverings which happened when Obama took over from Bush. Legally speaking at least. So that is a very different situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The South Sudan situation is much closer to the Somaliland situation, but it also has one very important difference. South Sudan fought a long, protracted war against the Bashir regime which resulted in a 2005 peace agreement. This peace agreement between the rebels now forming the basis of the South Sudan government and the Bashir regime allowed for the South to have a referendum vote on independence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is a substantial difference than the unilateral declaration by Somaliland of the “reinstatement” of its independence, at least diplomatically. Somaliland has yet to negotiate with the internationally recognized government down in Mogadishu the terms of its separation. Partially this is due to the animosity between the two. Partially this is due to the fact that no single entity has been in Mogadishu for very long with a sufficient amount of political power for Somaliland to be able to have anyone legitimate on the other side of such a bargaining table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Transitional Federal Government has made great strides towards stability recently, they still only occupy half of their capital city and outside of that have very little ability to impose their will. So therein lies the crux of the problem for Somalilanders. They are steadily building their own country, and have an entire generation who know only Somaliland and nothing about the Republic of Somaliland, meanwhile their appeals to the international community have fallen on deaf ears and they have no one in Mogadishu that for the foreseeable future they will be able to negotiate with the terms of their separation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are an incredible amount of layers to this onion and in future posts I hope to have the time to peel this back a bit further, but for tonight this will have to suffice.&lt;/p>

What Now?</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-05-02-ok-so-hes-gone-what-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-05-02-ok-so-hes-gone-what-now/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I woke up this morning to the news. Obama Killed Osama. In my groggy state, I couldn’t really piece together what was happening on my collated facebook and twitter streams until I saw something similar to the previous sentence. I think the first thing I cognized was a friend’s facebook post: “Osama, so 10 years ago.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to NYTimes.com and saw the huge headline and the gigantic picture of the President staring at me, resolute &amp;amp; determined. After reading the article, and then watching my Twitter feeds more closely than usual today (which has been a busy one and not really allowed me to dig as deep into the commentary as I would like), I think my overall thought is, “Osama, so 10 years ago.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is actually quite amazing to consider that it was almost 10 years ago that I was sitting with my Marine infantry officer friends in our boxers and t-shirts watching GWB announce to the world that our nation’s military was on its highest alert and looking around the room thinking, “Huh?” as a typhoon raged outside and we couldn’t even leave the building. That was 9-11-01. This is 02-05-11 (date formats have been shifted in accordance with my mindset).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The news, while large, seems quaint. Many nations with majority muslim populations have bigger problems today, and they now have viable outlets for those problems. Moderate muslims the world over have increasingly spoken out against extremism (exhibit A is the commercial I watch on Qatar based MBC movie channel which shows a young teenager watching extremist videos and ends with his mom watching him on one crying and then flashes something in Arabic which I assume says, “don’t be an idiot and blow yourself up”). Al Qaeda has fractured, has become cellular and largely unable to organize anything beyond a small isolated bombing for a long time now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My main question as to what now has much less to do with the muslim majority areas and much more to do with America. Our shorthand for “the enemy” is gone. So what will we do now? It is very difficult to motivate people, populations, and most importantly fighters to fight a war where they cannot “see” the reason that they are fighting. Our reason in Iraq left, but there was still a face there that was lingering, hovering over the consciousness. That face is now at the bottom of the ocean. I think we can smile that an evil human has gone, but the real point, the real concern I have, or better put, the hope that I hold to is that we Americans can now get back to showing the world that we know more than how to fight. That we know how to compete, how to build, how to innovate, how to drive progress, how to balance divergent political interests, how to develop systems which bring jobs and health and education. Let those be our exports. Instead of our current portfolio: facebook, google, and guided missiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concisely put by my friend: “Osama. So 10 Years Ago.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I read an interesting article yesterday from a man who I referenced in my previous post as one of my favorite development bloggers: Owen Barder. Owen has joined a DC based development think-tank called Center for Global Development and in his [good-bye to Ethiopia post][2] he had an interesting thing to say about aid. He claims, and I heartily support, that development is much broader than simply aid, it is about trade policy, climate policy, monetary policy (which he didn’t actually mention), and numerous other policies which the developed world implements and in the globalized economy has massive effects in the developing world.&lt;/p>

[2]: &lt;a href="http://www.owen.org/blog/4540">http://www.owen.org/blog/4540&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article returned my thoughts to something which I have pondered off and on for the eight months since we have opened the doors on &lt;a href="http://watershedlegal.com">Watershed Legal Services&lt;/a>, my small law firm in this corner of the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are an assortment of varied and divergently relevant reasons why I invested my time and money in this entity. It is a hodge-podge, a kaleidoscope which changes its predominant colors over time. For one, I wanted to get off the NGO train, to stop skimming the surface of places and to dig into a country. To plant roots. For another, my marriage wasn’t going to thrive in an environment where we were constantly moving as my wife is also a professional and the chances of two professionals finding professionally satisfying positions in a new country every two or three years was daunting at best. And I simply fell in love with Somalis and Somaliland – despite (or perhaps because of) its craziness, its madness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those are mainly all personal reasons, but there were also some professional reasons which I have considered at length. Rightly or wrongly I was tired of a culture of giving. Now that is not to say that I have stopped giving, indeed I cannot count the number of pro bono hours that our small firm has performed in our short life. I am not tired of giving, I am tired of the expectation that I am here to give – full stop. I am tired of a culture where nothing will happen without a body with money external to the state saying yes we will  fund that. These are backwards to how I see the world. I have no problems with giving a man a fish. But when there are so many fish givers in a place that the giving of a fish becomes an expectation then I think we have reached a point where things should be reevaluated. It isn’t development, it isn’t sustainable, and something has to give. This is why I was excited to start a for-profit law firm, this is why we don’t chase projects in the same way that NGOs do, this is why we haven’t taken outside funding from foundations or other organizations who have shown willingness to assist organizations such as Watershed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Law is not something that can be given. It is, at its core, a conversation between power centers. This conversation ebbs and flows over time. It changes and must change in order to have life and to enable its success. While it is a conversation which can often be informed by actors abroad, if it is not a conversation within the society in which it is being imposed, it will never be successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me put some meat on that paragraph. What I see from the other side of the table now that I have switched from a legal reform NGO to a practitioner within the country is a tangled mess of laws which will never be implemented here. I see laws built by consultants from other countries who have never bothered to learn the legal structures of this country and bring their own governance proclivities with them. The simple fact of a Kenyan consultant coming to Somaliland to write a law brings big troubles because until recently Kenya was a fundamentally British parliamentary system. Those types of governments operate in a fundamentally different way than governments on a different part of the spectrum. Somaliland, in contradistinction, is built upon an American model. You cannot simply take ideas of how the conversations between power centers works in one system and transplant them whole sale into a different system. Yes, there are often analogies, but not always. American notions of the separation of power and the reasons that America has been able to make an independent executive work requires a method of thought which differs in so many ways. It is like comparing how you talk to your close friends over a cup of coffee sitting on their couch to how you would talk to a new business associate. You talk fundamentally different because the social modes which develop around each of those situations is vastly different. The same is true about law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So really it boils down to the fact that I wanted to help Somaliland develop its own way of conversing. I want to stop consultants coming from other countries dropping off finished laws and running away. I want to assist parliament and the government to learn how to converse with each other in a legal sense. I want to give young, sharp lawyers a chance to move beyond a simple contract for an NGO where they will never be pushed where they will stagnate and never have the chance to have the feeling of a bit of hard work pushed out the door and the ultimate relaxation and joy which follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That, my friends, is why I do what I do. That, my friends, is why I’m more professionally satisfied in these recent months than I’ve ever been in my life.&lt;/p>

Closed for people. by BlueRobot @ flickr">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week two interesting articles (to me) have been published and they have given me the push to return to commenting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The articles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first was an &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704425804576220524034207558.html">Op-Ed&lt;/a> that was recently published by a publication which is not exactly known for its do-gooder tendencies, the WSJ. It was written by a man I know of, but surprisingly have never run into in the very small expat community we have here in Hargeisa, Jonathon Starr. It was a rage against the machine of the aid industrial complex, something that I can generally get behind. There were parts of the article I agreed with and parts which I disagreed with. Jonathon attacks aid, which is his right – even though I would argue he is an outsider. I am unimpressed by some his more self-righteousness (I took no salary and expect my staff to do the same). He also makes the general broad-side attack of an industry that is very much fodder for an Op-Ed but lacks the detail and bite of a genuine argument which make me think and reflect. The basic gist of the article is that aid is fundamentally flawed because the lack of a profit motive therein causes inefficiencies in its delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://talesfromethehood.com/2011/04/18/big-business/">second&lt;/a> was a response to Jonathon’s piece by one of my favorite aid-bloggers, J, who maintains the &lt;a href="http://http://talesfromethehood.com/">Tales from the Hood&lt;/a> blog (as well as the uber hilarious &lt;a href="http://stuffexpataidworkerslike.com">Stuff Expat Aid Workers Like&lt;/a>). J does not have the nicest take on what Jonathon originally wrote. He attacks Jonathon as an outsider who never learned about aid (a meme that he often comes back to and one in which I only partially buy). But more to the point, he defends aid by saying that it should not be run as a business.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-thoughts">The thoughts.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I would enjoy a response from Jonathon to J.  But in the event (a phrase I am increasingly enjoying), I think that if a discussion were to develop they may be arguing past each other. I have a decent understanding of what Jonathon is doing here. It is a small town, and even smaller where the expats are concerned; as with all small towns, we’re in each other’s business to the point of dysfunction. What he is doing is not really what I would classify as aid work. That is to say, it isn’t NGO work as I would classify such. I would call it non-profit work. I make this distinction because Jonathon isn’t really struggling with the same things that most people I know who are EAWs struggle with. It is a subtle distinction, running a program focussed on opening schools and opening a school, but it is a distinction nonetheless. I should clarify this more but it is getting late and I’m lazy. Let us leave it at this: the scale, the tensions, the accounting, the partners – all of these are very different. That aside, Jonathon is clearly an intelligent man and whether he lacks or possesses epistemic authority as an insider to back his argument he originally crafted it and I would hope that he is willing to engage, defend, respond, and converse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they both could agree on one point, and it is a point which &lt;a href="http://owenabroad.com">Owen Barder&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/">Duncan Green&lt;/a> have made eloquently. Owen has made it numerous times, and &lt;a href="http://www.owen.org/blog/4018">here&lt;/a> is one example. I cannot seem to find Duncan’s, but I remember he has written at least one very good piece on it. The upshot of their argument is that aid is fundamentally lacking feedback mechanisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This, it seems to me, is what Jonathon was originally trying to say. He rightly identifies one of the major problems with aid (its lack of feedback), but he misplaces the meat of his argument by equivocating (wrongly I think) a profit motive with feedback. Yes, in some businesses the bottom line is one of the feedback mechanisms to show whether there is uptake of the goods or services. But the key is not the presence or absence of a profit motive, the key is the presence of ANY feedback loop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>J rightly defends some of the current state of aid affairs by saying that indeed aid is not business and some efforts to make it more business-like would be misplaced. Such a reformation would in many instances leave out the real points of aid which is delivery of services to under-serviced sectors – sectors which the profit driven world has, for whatever reason, missed. That would be precisely contrary to what the aid world should be doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning from different sectors is one thing. When I was a Marine, I knew others who got the opportunity to go be seconded to a big company or to the stock exchange for a year or so. They brought back with them their lessons learned and they improved some things within the Corps. And that was fine. That is simply organizational learning. But the reformation which Jonathon proposes is quite a different thing. I fail to see where the presence of a profit motive would truly affect the delivery of NGO services. I see for-profit clinics and schools all around me during my drive to work every day. And I also see tons of kids unable to afford those schools therefore playing in the streets at school time and old ladies too sick to walk to the clinic and unable to afford the clinics anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The profit motive is not what is wrong with aid. What is wrong with aid is that it has built into itself neither feedback loops nor accountability. I do not know of a single industry more isolated or insular than aid. There are those inside the echo chambers of twitter and blogs and they are each trying their best to improve the accountability and the feedback mechanisms, but the bottom line is that aid is an industry which is out of site and out of mind for everyone who is not an insider. And what incentive to any of the insiders have to change things other than simple altruism which is never a very powerful motivator? If aid fundamentally changed and if aid accomplished its mission many of the insiders would be out of jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so the cycles spin and people (like J) scream how aid needs professionals in order for it to be delivered correctly. While I do not quibble with what he is saying, I think that outsiders need to engage more. I appreciate the courage which Jonathon displayed in making his original argument. The more outsiders disrupt, the more insiders disrupt, the more improvements we will hopefully see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of spaces to fill. There are spaces which aid (at least of the international, relatively big-money variety) deserves to be, where it can properly fit and prosper. There are spaces where locally oriented non-profits deserve to be, where they can properly fit and prosper. And there are spaces where businesses should be. If each continues to share lessons learned and if there continues to be a good conversation between the many camps and factions then hopefully what we are all searching for, a reasonable chance for those we wee around us, will come ever closer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But let us not turn our comparisons of apples and oranges into app-ange juice because even though I have never drank that I’m not sure it would be delicious.&lt;/p>

The chance to take your now 6 year old new organization to the next level. AJE was a regional power, had a lot of money behind it, but is still banned in the US and largely doesn’t have the legitimacy of CNN and BBC. But this was their chance, and they absolutely nailed the coverage. It was spectacular in every way I can think of, and for all my friends I only wish you could have seen the narrative unfold.
The first night I paid attention to Egypt was Jan 28, the first Friday after it all began.  That was the day that everything seemed to blossom.  That was the day when the police cracked down but then were beaten down.  That was the day the army took to the streets and no one was sure how they would react.  That was the day that they shut down the internet.  So much happened.
From the balcony of AJE’s offices we watched the building of the ruling party burn, we watched a police APC stopped, tried to get thrown in the nile, and eventually burned in place (two weeks later I was awed by the continued presence of the carcass in a sweeping shot meant to show something else).
There are too many reasons why AJE’s coverage of Egypt was an absolute masterpiece of television and journalism, something that should be studied not only in journalism schools but also in film schools.  It was brilliant in its ability to capture the emotions of what was happening.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aljazeeraenglish/5413058725">![Egypt political crisis via Al Jazeera English @ flickr]({{ site.url }}{{ site.root }}{{ site.images_dir }}/{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; }}/5413058725_d416628f87.jpg)&lt;/a>
On Thursday Mubarak spoke. The world watched in collective silence and about two or three minutes into the speech it became clear that he was entrenching himself.  Within about ten seconds of me hearing that, AJE slowly fed in the audio from Tahrir square where things were going nuts side by side with its translator continuing to do his thing.  It was subtle and it was brilliant.
[This NYT’s][3] article today compares their coverage to MSNBC and CNN and the others. It talks about another of the moments of brilliance. On Friday after Sulieman announced that Mubarak had stepped down the anchor simply said, “he’s gone.” And then it was just radio silence from talking.  All we saw and heard was sweeping shots of hundreds of thousands of people in the biggest celebration of their lives.  No words could describe it.

I know I’m in danger of fawning here, which is never attractive, but it is difficult to contain myself. The final thing that was so special about this coverage, was that most of the reporters that AJE brought in were Egyptian diaspora. They all had a personal stake in what was happening around them, but they never let that come through and color their commentary in any way. In the end the anchor had to force them, and even then as the NYT’s article says they were true human beings with some staying steadfastly professional, and some more emotional. Get yourself some of their good journalism (please, if only so I can watch it when I am back in the States as I’m not sure I can stand American news/punditry for more than about 30 seconds of its screaming overly emotional coverage of anything) by [clicking here][5] and putting in your zip code. And watch some of the videos.

The final thing I will say is this: [Ayman][6] [Mohyeldin][7] is now among my favorite reporters. They guy was absolutely unbelievable from the beginning to the end.

&amp;ldquo;THIS COULD HAVE BEEN STRAIGHT OUT OF A MOVIE! #jan25 #egypt&amp;rdquo; via Farrah3m @ Twitpic
Two days ago, my father asked me for my thoughts on the protests throughout the Arab world. I wanted to compose my thoughts, to let the situation develop a bit further before I said anything.  Now is the time to say something.
This is utterly fascinating to watch.  Al Jazeera is very much killing it with fantastic shots – news hasn’t captivated me in this same way since watching CNN from the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad in 1991.  On Friday I was sitting with my friends and we watched the following sequence unfold in real time: reports of police sending reinforcements into streets, video of police apcs flooding streets, video of protesters stopping one vehicle, video of  police scrambling and fighting their way out of back of vehicle protesters beating the driver, video of protesters trying and failing to tip apc over and “throw” into nile, reprieve, reports of army being called onto streets, video of apc being lit on fire, and for the next three hours they would every once in a while cut back to the same burning apc.  It was magical, riveting, unbelievable tv.
I was watching very closely when earlier (before the above sequence) a lone army apc came into the screen (was easy to tell as was painted different color, a fairly standard practice worldwide).  The people went utterly nuts.  And the army seemed to be cheering the protesters back.  It was pretty far away from the cameraman so it was difficult to see exactly, but it was super interesting.  That was before Mubarak called the army onto the streets.  The stoppage for the prayers was the other thing that fascinated me, but back to the army.  The Egyptian army is a conscript army, and it closer to the middle/lower classes than the police are, given that the police are not conscripts and are often hand chosen by the regime.
The story aside, what is my chat on this topic?  Three things strike me: (1) the interconnectedness of the pan-Arab movement may be among the causes of the downfall of the creators; (2) [Gladwell][2], you’re wrong; (3) the results of the variety of protests is going to differ, likely in proportion to GDP.
[2]: &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pan-arab-movement">Pan-Arab Movement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, all of these are connected.  The Tunis protests, and their subsequent victories, beget the Egyptian protests, and as they say: as Egypt goes, so goes the Arab world.  But look at what I pulled just a few minutes off of Twitter:
[![][4]][4]
[]: &lt;a href="http://www.caseykuhlman.com/entry/egypt-burning-arab-protests/scr">http://www.caseykuhlman.com/entry/egypt-burning-arab-protests/scr&lt;/a>
The protests just continue to spread: Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Algeria, Bahrain, Libya. The linkages that have been built, especially in the post-colonial world between the Arab nations, which was originally established as a bulwark against the West (among other reasons) is now making the spread of protest-ism violently, breathtakingly fast.
And yes, technology is helping to facilitate the spread.  I have seen[ twitpics of letters][4] from Tunisian protesters to Egyptian protesters with tips on how to fight the man.  Encouragement and organizing are all happening online.  Why else would Egypt completely pull the plug?
[4]: &lt;a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2011/01/journal-example-of-open-source-tactical-innovation.html">http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2011/01/journal-example-of-open-source-tactical-innovation.html&lt;/a>
Third, and this is what is going to take longer to figure out.  But the end result of this wave, I suspect is going to distill rough correlative to GDP of the nations.  Tunisia and Egypt will likely see some fundamental changes.  Syria and Bahrain will likely see some changes, but not fundamental ones.  Libya, Sudan, and Yemen will likely have to wait a bit longer for fundamental changes within their countries.  I’m a Collier-ist and I am interested to see if this is going to validate his [theories ][5]that at about $3000 per capita GDP is some sort of a tipping point for democracy.  Thailand reached that and it beget massive protests, the countries listed above are there, China is approaching this threshold.  Yet, we will see.  Only after the fact will we see.

The last thing I’ll note is that a power vacuum in Egypt is in precisely no one’s interest.

&lt;p>“An association of men who will not quarrel with one another is a thing which has never yet existed, from the greatest confederacy of nations down to a town meeting or a vestry.” ~ Thomas Jefferson&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I know I am generalizing, but since many that I know and love subscribe to many of these philosophies maybe I do have a small bit of perspective here.  Let me take a look at the Free Market system and rules.  Many have argued that rules are inherrently anti-market.  That the opposite of capitalism is rule-making by regulators.  Maybe that is right in some areas, but I would argue that it depends on the specific area in mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The big-government crowd is drawn to the compulsory nature of centralized authority. They can’t imagine an undirected social order. Someone needs to be in charge—someone who knows better. Big government is audacious and conceited. By definition, government is the means by which citizens are forced to do that which they would not do voluntarily. Like pay high taxes. Or redistribute tax dollars to bail out the broken, bloated pension systems of state government employees. Or purchase, by federal mandate, a government-defined health-insurance plan that is unaffordable, unnecessary or unwanted. For the left, and for today’s Democratic Party, every solution to every perceived problem involves more government—top-down dictates from bureaucrats presumed to know better what you need. Tea partiers reject this nanny state philosophy of redistribution and control because it is bankrupting our country.” ~Dick Armey &amp;amp; Matt Kibbe @ &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704407804575425061553154540.html">WSJ&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Reject Cap &amp;amp; Trade - Stop costly new regulations that would increase unemployment, raise consumer prices, and weaken the nation’s global competitiveness with virtually no impact on global temperatures.” ~ Tea Party Manifesto as defined by the Tea Party Patriots available &lt;a href="http://www.contractfromamerica.com/Idea.aspx">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Despite universal acknowledgement that Americans enjoy a free, open, and vibrant Internet, the FCC is relentlessly pursuing a massive regulatory regime that would stifle broadband expansion, create congestion, slow Internet speeds, jeopardize job retention and growth, and lead to higher prices for consumers.” ~ Virginia Tea Party Patriot Federation letter to the FCC re: Net Neutrality, excerpted &lt;a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/08/13/the-tea-party-hates-net-neutrality-because-its-an-affront-to-free-speech-umm/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Tea party members believe in this invisible hand spoken of by Adam Smith. Society is better off because of the free market. A person invents something so that they can make money, but in that self interest benefits society as a whole. Did the government invent the car, the computer, or airplane? Nope, self interested individuals invented these things. Did these inventions enrich society as a whole? Yes. Think about the amount of jobs created by the computer industry alone, everything these days (seemingly) has computer technology in it. Think about the amount of jobs created by the auto industry. When government steps into the free market it creates advantages for those it supports and disadvantages for those who is doesn’t support. The law of supply and demand has been tampered with, and the market is artificially manipulated. Sometimes these manipulations have a positive impact, only to come crashing back down. Most of the time they have a negative impact on the market.” ~ Available &lt;a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/what-the-tea-party-stands-for-free-markets">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Every generation needs a new revolution.” Thomas Jefferson&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I actually really like what the Tea Partiers have been able to accomplish, although I am about as far away from them policy-wise as possible, I like the fact that they are shaking things up for the entrenched political interests on both sides of the aisle.  That said, I think they are dead wrong when it comes to their hatred and shunning of rules, so I’d like to take a little moment here and explain things from my side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about sports.  Particularly, think about football.  A lot of rules were made in football between the mid-80′s to mid-90′s which had to do with protecting the quarterback.  Why is this person special?  Likely it was less because of his primacy on the playing field, and more likely because of his primacy in the board room.  Fine, but when those rules were adopted I don’t remember (although maybe it happened) any pundits arguing for the demise of football as we know it.  They were saying, no we need some fair competition, and if I spend Y of my cap money on a quarterback, I should have the opportunity to let that investment play out.  There was still plenty of competition, not the least of which was during the off season for prime players.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then let’s look at the salary cap &amp;amp; profit sharing mechanism that the owners have set up.  If this was tried in Washington it would have about a 0% chance of surviving a first draft and whoever the unlucky sap was that had the job of writing a first draft would be instantly shunned as a communist.  But when it comes to our beloved sport we say how great it is that small market teams like Pittsburgh still have the same chance of surviving as big market teams like New York.  Indeed big markets haven’t dominated football in ages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compare this to baseball.  That is the sport, for those of you who may remember, with the sticks and the balls and the clay in a diamond with a bunch of people basically standing around all the time.  There were two major turnoffs for many I know from my generation about baseball (besides it’s boring which I would argue against).  (1) “In baseball you can just go out and buy your team.  There is no thrill in just zero to winning.” It wasn’t satisfying when the Marlins bought a team and won the World Series in the late nineties.  Not at all satisfying.  (2) “They absolutely turned a blind eye to the steroid situation.”  Well, there you have it folks, rules (football) v. non-rules (baseball).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us talk NASCAR.  I grew up watching Dale Earnhartt, Bill Elliot, and those guys.  I was a number 3 guy.  I went to the Dayton 500 and remember the after effects of a fantastic Ricky Rudd accident that is still likely shown on best 100 crashes of all time on late night Spike TV.  What do people like about NASCAR?  What I liked about it is that the competition is based on pure skill.  It is pure skill in driving, and it is pure skill in engineering.  But engineering in the fine-tune sense.  The driver with the fastest car (interpret: has built the most efficient system) who is the best driver on that day (interpret: has great adaptability) most of the time wins.  It is fast and loud and visciously entertaining to go to the races.  But really races boil down to (besides keeping your hipster appeal by “making fun of the white trash people.”) a human struggle to best their machine and their elements.  But if you want to talk about systems with rules, the NASCAR rule book is lots of pages long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So rules, in and of themselves do not serve to stifle competition.  They often serve, instead, to shift power away from entrenched interests (NY Yankees) towards more of a meritocratic environment.   I’m all for rules if they allow two things: (1) lower barriers to entry (and no, it doesn’t matter to me if that comes at the cost of entrenched interests or people/entities with bigger bankrolls than I) and (2) promotes a meritocratic environment.  Those are the essential parts of the American dream which I hold onto.  I do not begrudge anyone their own perspectives and values that they hold on to, but those are the ones I hold as truisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is also why I &lt;a href="http://watershedlegal.com/about">work with small businesses here in Somaliland&lt;/a>.  If you want to know the effects of zero rule making look here.  When people want to see how a society (which isn’t much different than an American one – a coming post) operates under anarchical situations pick up a book and see what is happening (beyond the terrorism) in the three different major areas of Somalia – each with a progressively more mature rule-making capability.  And then compare those with a more advanced rule making capability of neighboring Ethiopia.  You can draw a distinct and direct correlation between stability, progress, and rule-making authority.  The most anarchical is the least developed.  The least anarchical is the most developed.  And in those sentences I’m conflating anarchy as an antonym of exercised rule-making authority of a government.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>She looked at my passport and flipped, and flipped, and flipped, and flipped. “Wow, you’ve been to a lot of places,” she said with fully disclosed jealousy.  Which at first I thought was odd.  Four years ago her accent alone would have seemed exotic, enticing, other.  Now she appeared to be just another worker trying to get by.  I glanced up from my Twitter scanning on my mobile and said without a pause the above reflection may suggest, “yeah, I’ve been to lots of the world’s shit holes.”   She laughed, and I felt sheepish at the arrogance which the comment may have implied.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>OK, I know where all the smoking bars are in Schipol.  I’m no longer surprised by the ridiculous, inefficient Heathrow monstrosity.  I’ve seen the super-efficient Germans’ achievements in process engineering at their militant, rule-loving best (that is, airports).  And don’t get me onto the shit holes where you step out of the secure area (if it exists) into a accosting of a wave of heat, humidity and noise – so much clammer and “taxi.”  I cannot tell you my mobile number at any given moment, but I can tell you my passport number, its issue date and its expiration date.  Along with my social security number and my best friend Joe’s parent’s home phone number these are the only strings of digits I seem to care to recall these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I packed my bags this time to return “home” to Somaliland I sighed and realized consciously, for the first time and perhaps temporarily, that I am dead fed up with traveling.  It isn’t so much the hassle of it all.  Even flying to Somalia is more or less straight-forward these days.  Carrying briefcases around airports isn’t vastly different than carrying them to the office.  I didn’t really turn the why over in m y mind too much as I was a bit hurried getting out the door.  The answer, now that I have had a bit of time, or at least part of the answer may be found here:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I walked down the stairs not really paying much attention.  I like to walk around airports with my headphones noise-canceling and L O U D to hear only the soundtrack to the assorted visions of ridiculosity that are most airports.  My personal montage bereft of gate change announcements and banal banter.  PSYCOLGIE – it screamed from its red perch on a glossy white background.  A magazine on psychology given prime placement is an oddity wherever you go.  ”Maybe I should get that for Brian (aka @worldliness).”  ”What the hell would he want with that?”  ”Maybe he’d like it since he is into psychology and it is from elsewhere.”   “But he can’t read it. What’s he going to do with it – hang it on the wall?” “True” I conceded to my sarcastic self while striding along past, another in the varied imagery of the montage.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>Here’s the rub: foreign crap is still crap.  Somehow, and I blame the subjects of Mad Men’s brilliant meanderings, we all have mostly had this fascination with travel.  The glamor, the otherness, the newness to it all.  But everywhere I go, I find people that are more or less the same as many of those I’ve known back home or in other places I’ve lived.  Indeed, I have increasingly come to the conclusion that any group of 5-10k people will have (within obvious allowances) about the same mixture of personality types and if transferred to an entirely new environment and given an entirely new set of problems and collective history – the groups would more or less act in the same manner (again, within allowances).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which reminds me of a Scooby Doo episode which somehow always terrified me as a youngster where the gang awoke in a place that looked exactly like the place they went to sleep in, except it was haunted!  Zoiks.  Therein was my introduction to parallel universe theory.  Indeed, for most of us we want the same things.  A family, friends, and a community we like, love and respect. Good health. Stable lifestyle. The illusion that things will be “better” for our kids (although I’m skeptical of the latter, and wonder often what “better” really constitutes).  We want to laugh, to each, to hug a partner, to do our thing – whatever that may be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is nothing particularly exotic about any place I’ve been. There may be beautiful vistas but those I’ve seen in any country I’ve been to, and some of the best are back home (but, of course, I’m biased). There may be beautiful people – but there are always ugle people too. At the end of the day, it boils down to this: &lt;em>see id.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Does the dystopic flattening of the world into a melancholy riff on the khackiness mean that I’m done?  That I’m off the crazy train I’ve been on since I left home at 18 to my first new place and new environment where I knew no souls? Doubtful. I still love to see new vistas – wherever they may be. I’m still seeking good food, good wine, laughter, romance, and the elusive new experiences. But I’m trying to settle the part of me that feels I’m missing something. The part telling me if I don’t do more, go more, be more that I won’t have enough stories to tell my grand kids. Live in the here and now. Be present – wherever you are. This is what I’m trying to remind myself of these days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here were the rules (since we’re lawyers and all).  There is a very long list of three.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(1) &lt;strong>Item SHALL have Boolean Attributes.&lt;/strong> This means that at 2359 on 31 December 2011, the item in question must be able to be given a True/False declaration.  This requires the item to be crafted such that it is definable, measurable, and specific.  Items such as “improve the quality of the services we deliver” are definitely out as they cannot be defined.  Items such as “give are clients great services” are definitely out as they cannot be measured.  You get the picture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(2) &lt;strong>Achievement of the item SHALL remain within the reasonable control of the declarant at all times.&lt;/strong> This means that items which are wholly out of control are not allowed.  Items such as “get invited to Davos, TED, and Clinton Global Initiative” are not within the control of the declarant at all and may not be on the list.   There is a qualifier on reasonable control wholly within the control of the declarant may require complete isolation – something us social beings can rarely achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(3) &lt;strong>Item SHALL not be overly materialistic&lt;/strong>. We wanted to track things that were fun and simple rather than list out how I want a new iPad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can follow the progress of the list over &lt;a href="http://elevens.caseykuhlman.com">here&lt;/a>!  I’ll be making small visual storytelling pages for each of the events which lend themselves to such an endeavor.  So, without further adieu: Our 11 for ’11:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Buy Tickets for London Olympics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One Night of Nothing but Music&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create Tasting Menu w/ Seasonal &amp;amp; Local Products&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ice Skate on a Frozen Pond&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish a Home Base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat @ a Restaurant Owned by a Top Chef Winner&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attend or Host a Wine Tasting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attend at least one Outdoor Concert&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prepare an alfresco picnic by a stream&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spend our anniversary together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spend an afternoon mushrooming&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
