class=post-title><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006-06-16-internship-journal-for-the-last-week/>internship journal for the last week</a></h2><div class=post-content><p>the following is my excerpt from my last journal entry, which i had to submit to my faculty advisor:</p><p> this week<br>the claim preclusion opinion that i drafted, and was circulated, was<br>returned. the comments and feedback were<br>interesting and varied greatly from the judge who is on the campaign trail<br>right now who signed off without a single pen change to the judge who<br>“couldn’t” comment because there was “too much work” to be done on it (she also<br>did not make a single pen change) to actually helpful comments on some of the<br>reworking of the issues. it made me<br>think of something a guy said to me last summer. last summer i was a panelist on the aspen<br>summer words writer’s festival and after we finished the panel i was at the bar<br>having a drink with one of the other panelists who was a magazine writer. we were talking about editing and he told me<br>something that stuck. he said “i think<br>of the editing process as a negotiation between the editor and myself.” that seems an incredibly apt metaphor here<br>where all the judges either have to sign off on the opinion or draft a new<br>opinion (which, of course, they are not jumping at the opportunity to do since<br>they each have their own caseload of opinions to write). i was laughing about that comment to today as<br>my supervising staff attorney was putting her little side comments on whether<br>or not i should incorporate wordings and phrasings from a particular<br>judge. it was evident who had the<br>negotiating power among them and who did not. “she is a great editor since she was a former english teacher.” [read, incorporate her changes word for<br>word.] “she just rewrote it the way she<br>would have originally wrote it were she working on the opinion.” [read, incorporate whatever you think is<br>valid and discard the rest.] “now this<br>is incredibly unhelpful.” [read, don’t<br>even bother to look through it.] </p><p>when we were going over the changes<br>that she actually wanted me to incorporate she made a comment that i thought<br>was incredibly helpful thing for me to keep in mind. it went something like this: “you know, you being a published author you<br>obviously brought with you a certain style for story telling. but when you write it is like you keep<br>forgetting that you are writing a legal document until the last second you<br>throw in a legal turn of phrase. it is<br>really jarring.” i pressed her on the<br>subject as i was really interested in this observation, mainly because i think<br>she is right. i asked her to clarify<br>whether she meant that it was bad that i was writing in a “story-telling way”<br>or was it bad that i was throwing in legal phrasings or was it bad that my<br>legal phrasings seemed tacked on and there was no smooth transition between the<br>two styles. she said that the hardest<br>thing was the jarring nature and that i need to make the transitions smoother<br>and stick in one “voice” or “style” for a complete section of a document and<br>then if i need to change the voice or style to make the transitions smoother or<br>at least at the beginning of a paragraph. i asked her to show me examples and she did. mainly what she was pinpointing were places<br>where my writing style was colloquial and simple but instead of using a<br>colloquial or simple word i would throw in legalese. her observation was dead on as i started to<br>review some stuff i do that. so it is<br>something for me to work on.</p><p>but i was thinking today about why<br>and/or whether there should be a noticeable difference between the two writing<br>styles. i mean, there obviously is a<br>tangible difference between the two, if there were not then you would have one<br>job instead of two. i guess much of it<br>is historical/cultural. the profession<br>developed with some sort of a need to prove itself and one of the ways that i<br>think the legal profession justified its existence and filtered out those who<br>would gain entry to its ranks was by adopting new words, forms of speech and<br>phrasings. the legal community seems to<br>pride itself on these distinguishing characteristics. “it is what separates us from the normal<br>people,” or something to that effect. but, frankly, i think that that is crap. if there is an easier way to say something that does not require you<br>shoehorning your writing into a certain form why should you have to rearrange<br>your writing to a form that outside the legal community most people would think<br>is ineffective and unappealing stylistically just because “it is what judges<br>and senior partners expect.” (i<br>reflected on the quote that chicago manual style likes by churchill that is an<br>incredibly hard to read sentence where he was making the point that often times<br>it is just easier to end a sentence with a preposition.) i was thinking about that for a bit and then<br>it occurred to me that that is no different than anything else. all this boils down to is knowing your<br>audience, an elementary tenant of writing. </p><p>my judge has told me in the past<br>that he is a very story oriented writer. he knows that he is in the majority, but still thinks that it is ok to<br>put a little bit of personality into your opinions. as such he let me go with the opinion in my<br>voice that (stylistically at least) fits with his philosophy on legal<br>writing. a litigant or staffer that<br>knows that can be “looser” with his or her writing style when they present<br>something to him. other judges here at<br>this court are much more stylistically formal and they require more formal<br>reasoning and style out of the written documents they receive. </p><p>i guess it simplifies to there<br>isn’t so much of a conflict between the two writing styles as there is between<br>the audiences. if i had never been<br>enabled by my judge to “tell a story, write this opinion like you’re writing it<br>to your mom,” then i never would have had a conflict. i would have just writing very impersonal and<br>formal. the staff attorney is a more<br>formalist person and writer, but she knew that my style is more similar to the<br>judge’s than it is to hers and she was ok with that. i realized later that what she was really<br>saying to me is to stick with one thing and be brave enough to continue<br>that. just because i’m writing a legal<br>document doesn’t necessitate that i must insert legal phrasings just to lend<br>them authority. i guess she was saying<br>that if your argument and reasoning is solid (which most seemed to think that<br>it was) then you don’t need to bolster it with words and phrasings that<br>obviously do not fit with the rest of your document.</p></div></article><hr><div
