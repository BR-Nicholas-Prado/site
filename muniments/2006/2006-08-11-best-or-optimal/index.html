class=post-title><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-08-11-best-or-optimal/>best or optimal?</a></h2><div class=post-content><p>I have decided to<br>return to Vanderbilt this semester.  My job possibility with the Program<br>Director for USAID down in Colombia is coagulating, but slowly.  I am<br>going to try to set it up to be down there from January until August,<br>and use that time to get a semester long externship from Vanderbilt. <br>Then return and finish up two semesters and be done.</p><p>When I came to Law School, as most of you know, I had three career<br>tracks in mind: environmental lawyer for a plaintiff’s firm,<br>media/entertainment lawyer centering my practice on the book industry,<br>and international development (or as I say, helping developing countries<br>pull themselves out of poverty without mortgaging their environments). <br>Over the course of the year and this summer I have realized that I<br>operate best and am most happy in the policy spectrum where I can pull<br>on my interdisciplinary skills and my abilities to communicate with lay<br>people.  The minutiae and the drudgery that would be required if I was<br>in a firm are irreconcilable with my platform, my convictions and my<br>goals of &ldquo;making a goddamn difference.&rdquo;  I decided earlier this summer<br>that the third track, international development, was where I needed to<br>be.  I maintain that position.</p><p>After making that decision I started to research my employment<br>opportunities.  Most of the consulting firms and public agencies were<br>recruiting their entry level employees from the MPP (masters of public<br>policy) schools around the country.  When I thought about it, an MPP<br>sounded enticing, and this degree was even more enticing when I started<br>to pull the curriculum.  So I thought that maybe I should have an MPP<br>instead of a JD.  But I was behind the power curve and would not be able<br>to start for a year.  I thought about what to do during the interim. <br>That was where I was when I last sent out a mass email.</p><p>Since then I have realized from talking to friends, family and mentors<br>(you all) that it was most advantageous to me to graduate with a JD.  A<br>JD is one of the most marketable degrees available, and I have already<br>finished the hardest part of it:  the first year.  A JD is also a<br>sufficient way to get into international development.  Just because the<br>firms and agencies pull mostly from MPP schools, that does not mean I<br>cannot get a job with one of them with a JD.  It seems stupid not to<br>finish my JD, even though I do not want to be a practicing attorney.</p><p>After I made that realization I started to think about the possibility<br>of doing a joint degree (JD/MPP).  I did more research and found out<br>that I could get joint degrees at Georgetown and at George Washington. <br>Both of these schools offered a JD curriculum in environmental and<br>international law that dwarfs the possibilities Vanderbilt offers, not<br>to mention their MPP curriculum’s.  Both of these schools are in DC and<br>the experiential opportunities that would be available to me in DC (with<br>a Presidential campaign, with the State Department, or with a consulting<br>firm) dwarf the opportunities that would be available in Nashville. <br>Both of these schools would allow me to start (if I was accepted as a<br>transfer student) in January.</p><p>This is a very lucrative possibility.  It is sexy.  It is a gamble.  It<br>appeals to my sense of adventure, my gambling nature, and my<br>wanderlust.  It would be the optimal solution.  But it would not be the<br>best solution.</p><p>It seems that the best solution, at this point, is to hammer through my<br>Vanderbilt JD.  The curricular opportunities, if I choose wisely, will<br>be sufficient to get me where I want to go.  With summers I can get some<br>modicum of experiential learning to round out my resume.  And, frankly,<br>it would be easier to not dislodge my entire life, and to just return.</p><p>Last night I received an email from my connection down in Colombia.  I<br>thought for a while that this was going to further contemplate my<br>at-that-point-unresolved decision.  He wants writing samples and it is<br>looking more and more likely that he will offer me some sort of an<br>internship.  But it isn’t going to happen quickly.  At this point the<br>soonest he could reasonably want to see me down there would be October. <br>If I am offered an internship I will ask to start in January.  This will<br>allow me to (hopefully) get credit and maintain my matriculation status<br>as Vanderbilt.  It will keep me on my path to quickly making a<br>difference.  It would fill in the gaps in my resume (language and<br>applied experience in international development).</p><p>So, in a sense, I am taking the easy road.  My wanderlust is modestly<br>disappointed in me, but if I can get a great summer internship next<br>summer (or eight months in Colombia) then I will just tell him to shut<br>the hell up.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg
