and will elect people who have worked their<br>way up through the bureaucratic rungs on one level of government.</p><p>We have codified our openness.  Ian Bremmer wrote a book that strongly<br>links a country’s openness to its stability.  Those that are the most<br>open<br>are the most stable, those that are the least open are also relatively<br>stable.  There is a dip in the curve close to the least open side,<br>where a<br>country falls into deep instability and if it emerges &ldquo;open&rdquo; then it<br>is on its way to a western style democracy.  Bremmer looks at openness<br>in<br>the communicative sense.  He asks what is a people’s ability to<br>communicate with the outside world, as well as what are the lines of<br>communication<br>inside the country.  This isn’t a techno-centric thing, despite the<br>inevitable connotations.  It is cultural and structural as well,<br>involving<br>the political regime established, the embracing of fundamental human<br>rights<br>(free expression, free assembly, etc.), education and the like.  This<br>is<br>obviously a very European idea and your codification of systems that<br>retain a<br>country’s openness are likely to sate many of the EU’s concerns. </p><p>THE SECOND THEME is that although bottom-up solutions may be best in<br>the long<br>term, they may not work in many instances.  Many of the people who<br>&ldquo;do&rdquo; development seem, to me, eternal optimists and people who really<br>rely on the power of humanity.  This is all well and good, but problems<br>arise when you give a people more power than they are able or willing<br>to<br>have.  It is the redneck winning the lottery syndrome, before you know<br>it<br>you have a culture of corruption with cadillacs sitting on monster<br>truck wheels<br>driving the politicians around (or, think post Soviet Russia with six<br>men<br>controlling the entire economy).  So in certain places, at certain<br>times<br>top down solutions may have to be imposed. </p><p>I include in these top-down solutions establishment of patronage<br>networks from<br>the government to the people (which are ripe for corruption),<br>establishment of<br>semi-autonomous regions (which are ripe for future nationalistic<br>worries –<br>when many Shiites flood into Kurdish Iraq because Shiite Iraq is<br>embroiled in<br>civil war, why would the Kurds want to remain Iraqi?), establishment of<br>some<br>form of affirmative action (contract allocation, governmental seat<br>allocation,<br>etc.). </p><p>The appeal of top-down solutions is that the ones who can govern do<br>govern.  This centralizes the decisions and implementations in the<br>hands<br>of those that have the knowledge, experience and capacity to actually<br>govern.  Much of the problem in the developing world is the lack of<br>people<br>who are trained to govern.  It isn’t a lack of ability nor is it a lack<br>of<br>capacity (often post-conflict rulers will have massive political<br>capital and<br>significant economic capital from a world community anxious to &ldquo;solve<br>the<br>problem&rdquo;), it is simply an education problem — at least in my mind.<br>Incompetence will only frustrate the situation.  South Africa has<br>worked<br>not only because Mandela had massive political capital, but also<br>because his<br>monetary policies were spot-on what was required and generally he had<br>figured<br>out how to govern that country; alas the same things cannot be said for<br>much of<br>the rest of the continent where incompetent and self-serving rulers<br>have<br>created a movable feast of governance. Top-down solutions are also<br>easier to<br>impose, easier to regulate, have more accountability (the world bank<br>will be<br>happier to give money if it knows exactly what the money is going for),<br>appeal<br>to our intellectual notions of symmetry (80% of south africans are<br>black and<br>therefore blacks should have 80% of the parliamentary seats), and they<br>have<br>worked in many situations.</p><p>The problems with top-down solutions are easy to see when you look at<br>the<br>post-colonial world.  The problems that linger in latin america and</p><p>africa</p><p>particularly are endless, many of them<br>attributable to top-down solutions imposed by governments from afar<br>without a<br>careful consideration of why and how they were being adopted and<br>implemented.  A curious situation arises with these things because<br>there<br>is not a historical precedent of not working, it is the exact<br>opposite.<br>Many people have seen them work as stop-gap solutions and then be<br>exploited or<br>create long-term problems.  Think how long colonialism worked and the<br>long-term cultural and structural problems that its hangover has<br>caused.<br>One of the major problems with</p><p>Yugoslavia</p><p>from the start, as I’ve read, was that the Kosovars had semi-autonomy<br>which<br>threatened the Serbians.  So if that was a problem in the</p><p>Yugoslavia</p><p>situation, creating resentment by the Serbs that fueled Slobadon’s<br>fire, maybe<br>doing the same thing to the Serbs in Kosovo is not a good idea.  That<br>is<br>very simplistic, and maybe wrong, but it illustrates the point that in<br>the long-view<br>it may not be a very good idea. </p><p>SO HOW TO BALANCE top-down short-term stability with bottom-up<br>long-term<br>stability?  This is the whole thing. </p><p>Developers would love to see a<br>stable-western-style-market-based-democracy.  Institutions (UN, IMF,<br>WB,<br>EU) would love to see top-down solutions that have strong<br>accountability.<br>Balancing them takes time, education to develop the cultural<br>dispositions that<br>allow for the give and take a society needs to grow.  Balancing also<br>requires a certain amount of structural flexibility.  So whatever the<br>solution is, it has to take into account the culture and history of the<br>region,<br>the country and the specific minorities or problem.</p><p>Generally I’ve seen two paradigms: (1) step-approach, phase-out<br>approach.<br>This is where institutions start out very centralized and then they<br>slowly let<br>the sand fall through the fingers.  An apt example is</p><p>Turkey</p><p>, Ataturk had strong centralized<br>control<br>but never &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; that and eventually, after he passed and</p><p>Turkey</p><p>could<br>&ldquo;handle it,&rdquo; the centralized control was distributed.  (2)<br>structural-flexibility from the start approach.  This is the</p><p>US</p><p>founding<br>father’s approach.  They built structural flexibility into the system<br>from<br>the start that allows for the various balloons to expand and contract<br>without<br>blowing up. </p><p>How to choose between these paradigms?  Where to put the flexibility<br>and<br>rigidity?  Where to put the phase-out decisions points?  All these<br>questions are what makes the problems complex and interesting.  The<br>answers are often buried in the historical and cultural predicates. </p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/58b0c1a5ffdcbb3e9690e5228794d5b3971c6df7 target=_blank rel=noopener>58b0c1a</a> @ 2020-04-08</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
