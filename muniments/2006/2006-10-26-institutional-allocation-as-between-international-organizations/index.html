This is known in the State context<br>as <em>prescriptive jurisdiction</em>. (2) What is the power of the States party to the institution as well as the<br>institution itself to adjudicate interpretive or substantive disputes that<br>arise in the course of implementation and execution of the treaty? This is known as <em>adjudicatory jurisdiction</em>. When you look at competing institutions you are basically asking: how do<br>we allocate the prescriptive and adjudicatory jurisdiction as between them? </p><p> The institutional allocation issue is not unique to int’l<br>law.  However the int’l law application<br>of the issue raises unique questions. Questions<br>of institutional allocation are familiar to American lawyers in the contexts of<br>administrative law (how much should Congress legislate and how much should it<br>leave to the administrative agencies) as well as federalism. Int’l law brings unique questions to the<br>issue. The two main questions come from:<br>complete, uniform and absolute sovereignty as well as from the equal footing of<br>treaties. </p><p> All treaties may not be created equal, but there is no<br>hierarchy of treaties. The UN Charter<br>may be the granddaddy of treaties, but outside that there is very little hierarchical<br>rules. Certainly there is no standard<br>regime for distributing between treaties. There are three applicable rules of construction from the Vienna<br>Convention on the Laws of treaties that are applicable. They are all found in Article 30. (1) Lex Specialis could trump lex generalis<br>if the later treaty contains greater detail and if it regulates the same<br>subject matter as an earlier treaty. This is only applicable if all relevant States are parties to both treaties. (2) When all applicable States are parties to<br>the subsequent treaty the later in time rule usually applies. (3) When all applicable States are parties to<br>only one treaty, that treaty trumps treaties that not all applicable States are<br>parties to. These rules may cut against<br>each other in various contexts, but outside of these general rules there are no<br>specific rules for conflict of laws and conflict of forum scenarios that arise<br>as between int’l treaties.</p><p> Second, states retain the power. It is only in ceding power to an IO that that<br>IO gains any power. But all power is<br>vested in the individual states. This is<br>extremely familiar to American lawyers as a federalism concern. However, it is different in the int’l context<br>because there is no absolute inclusion like there is in the
US</p><p>context. This lack of absolute inclusion, or what<br>could be termed top-down compulsion, adds a level of complexity to the debate<br>when it turns to rights of dissenters as well as the prescriptive jurisdiction. Just because a state may cede some<br>prescriptive power to the WTO to set various schedules and rates, that does not<br>mean that the state necessarily cedes prescriptive power to that body to<br>regulate domestic environmental policy. When<br>a State does not like or agree with an action taken by IO, the latter body has<br>very little power to force its will on the State. If the State finds it more efficient or less<br>costly it can leave the IO or snub its nose at the IO. B/c the ultimate power is vested in the State<br>and there is no ability of the IO to force compulsion a State will only comply<br>with the will of an IO if it is less costly to do so. These costs come in reputational and<br>political as well as in economic forms. The same cannot be true in the
US</p><p>federal system. If GA doesn’t like a decision or a statute of<br>the federal government it cannot snub its nose at the federal government and it<br>cannot pack its bags. </p><p> Now that we have identified a few of the unique questions<br>that arise when asking institutional allocation questions in the international<br>context, let’s apply those to our question. First off, when we ask questions of the allocation of prescriptive<br>jurisdiction as between IO’s that will necessarily alter the jurisdiction as<br>between states. Some states will have<br>much more involvement in one treaty than they will in another. States that have more invested in a given<br>treaty will obviously want that treaty body (or IO) to have more prescriptive<br>jurisdiction. There are also the questions<br>of influence over the subject matter, involvement in the “legislative” process,<br>and expertise over the subject matter.  </p><p> This horizontal allocation of jurisdictional power as<br>between states becomes especially salient when you look across subject matter<br>boundaries. Some societies will<br>obviously value a given subject matter more than they may value other subject<br>matter (turtles may be more important than money to some). The difference in values placed by each State<br>on a given subject matter creates a tension as between different IO’s. Some small coastal states, or states with<br>large fishing fleets will have a lot of social investment, as well as capital<br>investment, in a RFMO and due to that investment they may wield more influence<br>in that IO. They will necessarily want<br>to optimize the jurisdictional power of their IO, often at a cost to IO’s that<br>regulate a different subject matter where their investments would have paid<br>smaller dividends.  Since each State<br>retains its sovereignty, it may be able to minimize the costs associated with<br>the transference of jurisdictional power as between IO’s by withdrawing from<br>the IO where power was drawn from or threatening to withdraw or by taking other<br>political tacks. </p><p> As one commentator has written “the market for transactions<br>in prescriptive jurisdiction is not yet very liquid.” This creates a problem if states do not<br>efficiently allocate from the start.  Since int’l law is an iterative process that<br>allocation can arguably never be efficient from the start, b/c there is no<br>start. What is time zero for one IO<br>cannot be time zero for another. Even if<br>they were to enter force on the same day, the provisions of each treaty are to<br>be interpreted in light of the context of the treaty. That context is a fluid thing that includes<br>all the events that gave rise to the negotiation of the treaty as well as the<br>way the negotiations were handled. Even<br>if there was a start point getting the initial allocation of prescriptive<br>jurisdiction efficiently allocated may involve a transaction with costs that<br>outweigh the benefits in every occasion. The transaction costs are likely to include: negotiating costs,<br>differing values and preferences and interests, binding, depth, holdouts,<br>reputational costs and political costs. </p><p> If there is no start point and if there is a very limited<br>possibility that states are going to efficiently optimize jurisdictional power,<br>then states must allocate jurisdictional power as between IO’s as efficiently<br>as possible along the way. This dynamic<br>component of the int’l law system can be easily analogized to a market system. But what is the market in prescriptive<br>jurisdiction? It is the int’l community<br>with a revolving door of relevant actors who have a revolving door of interests<br>motivating their actions. Or maybe<br>states could cede all powers in a repository that can allocate prescriptive<br>jurisdiction as between subject matter or regional IO’s. This centralized authority could bring<br>certainty to a system as well as stemming externalities in races to the bottom<br>by allocating prescriptive jurisdiction to the IO most likely to have the power<br>or influence or wedge that would stem a state’s momentum. This flexibility may be something we<br>want. If the int’l community wants a<br>State to live up to a certain norm then a central repository could allocate<br>prescriptive jurisdiction to an IO where that State has a larger stake than<br>influence. The targeted State would then<br>find itself in a position where the costs of non-compliance outweigh the<br>benefits. </p><p> Next I want to turn to the adjudicatory jurisdictional<br>issues. The world of treaties may look<br>to be discreet circles, but basically it represents a web of ven diagrams. This reality necessitates that there are<br>going to be many instances where there are competing norms and competing<br>interpretations and competing regulatory/policy responses. But there are two distinct questions<br>here: choice of law and choice of<br>forum. </p><p> In Art. 20 of the GATT the WTO said that other int’l<br>agreements that were entered into as necessary to protect human, animal or<br>plant life or heath are exempted from the provisions of the GATT. But that exemption has not been adopted. Indeed as the cases here illustrate, the WTO<br>has  put its fingers in many pots. So which norms should trump which? Which treaty should trump which? Which law should trump which? There is clearly no normative reason why the<br>provisions of the WTO should trump those of an int’l treaty. Now this is not what the WTO ruled,<br>ostensibly, even in its formalistic, far-reaching holding in Shrimp/Turtle<br>I. But if the regulations on trade and<br>on capture that were adopted by the
US</p><p>had been adopted by a RFMO how<br>could the WTO rule that its norms trump those of the RFMO’s? How do we choose when faced with such a<br>conflict of law question? Which treaty<br>would trump? That treaty which has<br>primary coverage over the subject matter? That treaty which recognizes the norms of another treaty? That treaty with the most members<br>trumps? That treaty that has the<br>strongest enforcement trumps? How we<br>integrate an allocate these differing bodies of law is becoming an increasingly<br>important subject for int’l lawyers. </p><p> Lastly, how do we choose the decision maker? Much of the criticism of the WTO in the<br>aftermath of these cases comes from their perceived or real bias. Should they be dabbling in environmental<br>protection? More importantly if there<br>was a buttress, a WEO how would they distribute the decision making as between<br>them in hard cases. Would they simply<br>negotiate between them? Would it be<br>plaintiff’s choice? Would we have to<br>codify specific choice of forum rules into all future treaties? Would we establish my customary int’l law<br>certain standards of comity between different forums? What would the comity multifactor test look<br>like? </p><p> A solution to all this would be to expand the jurisdiction<br>of the ICJ and the ICC or the WTO, etc. to include all international law. This one-stop shopping for litigants could<br>prove easy, but is it what the world needs. The difficulties in instituting the ICC are illustrative here. In that instance the ICC was established to<br>have subject matter jurisdiction over jus cogens norms — norms that are<br>universally condemned. But yet that<br>process was long, politically charged and costly on all sides. Its implementation has been far from<br>perfect. What happens if the int’l<br>community tries to expand a universal forum to adjudicate norms that are not<br>nearly as universally condemned. That<br>lack of moral impetus will probably be the divisive factor. That and the fact that states retain all of<br>their sovereignty.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/5fcb7aa062576518427ace5cf4afcb1b6f85686f target=_blank rel=noopener>5fcb7aa</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
