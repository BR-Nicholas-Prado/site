and we therefore pronounce it &ldquo;GAY-per.&rdquo;  not &ldquo;ga-per.&rdquo;</p><p>when we use it those that do not KNOW often ask for a definition or description.  up till now it had been hard for me to point to an iconic description pulled from pop culture that can help.  this difficulty is often compounded by the fact that if you are asking me what a gaper is it is likely that you are one, and i being the sensitive soul that i am do no want to unnecessarily hurt your feelings.</p><p>but now i have one.  i will now attempt to describe to you a gaper.</p><p>i had been up on steamboat for the first time.  i really liked the town.  it was like the rest of these mountains that by now i know quite well, except for much of the pompacity of them was conspicuosly absent in steamboat.  i don’t know why.  maybe because it is so far off the beaten path.  there were a few pretentious looking places but for the most part they were hidden behind gates.  all i could see were the millions of kids playing little league and families riding bikes along the river that flows through the town. </p><p>there is the moutain that didn’t look that tough but a veteran told me there was plenty of off-piste stuff, great tree skiing and some in bounds stuff that was fun and pretty tough.  there was a river with at least three play waves that i could see as i walked along it.  that was at a flow that wasn’t great since it’s been a warm spring and runoff happened for the most part before i got there, and it is pretty dry.  there were a few crags that i could see around, some with people on them, some without.  it seemed like an ideal place to me.  all the things without all the attitude.  quite a few real cowboys, like in jackson.  cheaper than jackson or aspen or vail.  the tourists that i could see, this being the weekend before the fourth there were many, were all from casper or denver.  that gives them legitimacy.  if you’re going to be a city dweller you at least have some authenticity if you come from wyoming or from denver, at least you have the rebuttable presumption of authenticity.</p><p>i decided to head up to this one falls.  i did not know until the road deadended into a forest service pay booth conveniently located around a corner and without a turn around.  i had vehicles in front of and behind me so my only choices were to turn around in the small parking lot on the other side of the booth and head back into town or pay the fee and actually see the falls that were apparently pretty kool, despite the unexpected fees.  i debated while the vehicle in front of me fucked around with some stuff and decided to pay the fee.</p><p>i parked and grabbed my nalgene and started walking.  there was really only one way to go, but there was a nice host there at the small map that i glanced at that was willing to give directions to lost souls.  i thought it was a nice way to earn a free place to camp your RV for the summer.</p><p>i walked along this cement path for like 300 yards to the overlook of the falls dressed in khaki shorts, a t-shirt, flip flops, sunglasses and a nalgene looped to my finger.  my other hand in my pocket.  i mean it was 300 yards along a cement &ldquo;path.&rdquo;  it wasn’t taxing.  i sat on a nice bench that i figured my $5 was going to help maintain for a while pondering life and waterflows and mosquitoes and whether or not i really had contracted west nile disease. </p><p>after a bit i decided to get up and head down to the base of the falls.  the overlook path had one side path that was not cement, but was asphalt, and therefore much more tricky for people i guess, that took you to the bottom of the canyon where you picked up a &ldquo;gasp&rdquo; dirt trail that ran for 200 yards or something along the river floor to near the base of the falls. </p><p>the entire area was about half a square mile and enclosed in a larger canyon.  there were lots of trees around but from the lookout area i was easily able to piece together the three trails that the small area contained.  i flipped back towards the asphalt path and i came upon my icon.</p><p>he was dressed in hiking boots, brand new REI shorts, a patagonia capilene layer and a nicearc teryx daypack that was jammed with god knows what.  he was conferring with his wife/friend/sister who was similarly attired.  they were conferring over a MAP.  a fucking MAP.  i paraphrase but i overheard something like this.  &ldquo;hmm, where do you think we should go, honey?&rdquo; &ldquo;well, we’ve been to the overlook, maybe we should head to the bottom of the falls, how do we get there?&rdquo; &ldquo;i don’t know, let me pull out my GPS to see where we are and then let’s plot our course to the bottom using this handy map the nice lady at the parking lot gave us.&rdquo;  i do not understand how these three trails could have made for ANY discussion much less this discussion that lasted from the time they were in sound until the time i couldn’t hear them any more as i flipped along the asphault trail.</p><p>i flipped down the winding switchbacks to the dirt trail at the bottom.  the river path was jammed with hippies and japanese people.  but there was one couple there who had an adolescent nephy.  suddenly i forgot everything and just missed bailey.  i was sad as i walked back to the car not because people are idiots but because i missed my dog.  there wasn’t a strong resemblance since that dog was actually in the water and wasn’t having the shakes due to his fear of the water like bailey would have, but nonetheless bailey was a good boy.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
