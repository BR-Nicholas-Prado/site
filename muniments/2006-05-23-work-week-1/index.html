Texas</p><p>has an ad valoreum taxing system<br>wherein they tax property owner’s real and profit-producing-personal property<br>based upon the valuation of that property. In the spring of each year the central appraisal district for each<br>county notices all the taxpayers (persons and businesses) with what it think<br>the value of the property owner’s property is. The owners have an opportunity to protest before a quasi-judicial<br>appraisal review board (an administrative agency that is linked to the CAD) before<br>the ARB’s orders become final. In this<br>case the tax rolls (which are “sacred” in TX) were certified by the ARB without<br>protest by the taxpayers. Then TX was<br>looking to raise its income to provide financing to its schools, and so the<br>legislature passed a bill providing taxpayers amnesty. Normally if the CAD finds that you have more<br>property than they said you had you would be liable for back taxes (five years<br>back for real property that it didn’t know about and two years back for<br>personal property that it didn’t know about), but in order to get more<br>disclosures the legislature relaxed the back taxes if certain conditions were<br>met. In other words if you disclosed to<br>the CAD after the tax rolls were certified that you actually had more taxable<br>property than the CAD thought than you wouldn’t be liable for back taxes. Again, it was all under the guise of raising<br>financing for the school districts.</p><p> The<br>taxpayers in my case disclosed what they had and then the CAD renoticed their<br>appraised value, but they did it wrong. Since the CAD didn’t utilize the correct procedures the taxpayers<br>protested to the ARB. The ARB granted an<br>administrative hearing where the taxpayers argued both the lack of proper<br>notice as well as the fact that they didn’t even have property that had<br>originally been omitted and therefore their tax liability should not<br>increase. The ARB ruled only that the<br>tax liability would remain the same as was on the certified rolls. The CAD “thought” this meant they got a re-do<br>in order to correct their procedural errors, so they renoticed, again, the<br>taxpayers. The taxpayers protested,<br>again, and at the hearings the ARB this time ruled in favor of the CAD. The taxpayers appealed to district court who<br>ruled in their favor and now we have it on appeal.</p><p> Ostensibly,<br>the legal issue is whether claim preclusion is applicable to an administrative<br>hearing. I think that this is an<br>interesting question. The policy reasons<br>generally proffered for claim preclusion in a normal, judicial setting are<br>economy (we want litigants to bring all of their claims in one case), fairness<br>(we should not give litigants an opportunity to correct their “lawyering”<br>mistakes until they finally get it right) and finality (at some point we have<br>to end this, it is the same argument that supports statute of limitations). While it seems that we generally have adopted<br>claim preclusion, we have placed certain limitations on the doctrine. For the doctrine to be applicable the second<br>case must have be a (1) final decision (2) rendered by a competent tribunal (3)<br>that was resolved on the merits. These<br>three limits make sense in that if an action is still pending and could end up<br>either way there should be no preclusion on another case. If the court that rendered judgment on the<br>case never had any business hearing the case in the first place it also makes<br>sense that subsequent litigation should not pay homage to that decision. The final one is the most intricate, but it<br>also makes sense in the abstract, subsequent litigation should not be precluded<br>by prior litigation that was never “actually litigated.”</p><p> Although<br>these policies are not that difficult to apply to a judicial setting that has<br>the pomp, circumstance, rules and societally recognized authority that a court<br>system maintains, it is more difficult to translate those principles to an<br>administrative setting. I do see a<br>certain simple beauty in applying procedural postures from the judicial setting<br>into the administrative (or quasi-judicial setting). It certainly would make things simple for<br>those who are advocating for their side of a dispute to prevail. But is it too simple to merely transpose<br>rules of evidence or rules of form or rules of procedure or other legal rules<br>and principles into a “foreign” setting? Without anything more than a simple adoption by the “foreign” tribunal I<br>think that would be fairly foolhardy, but if the same policy issues and<br>concerns that are supporting the legal principle or rule in the judicial<br>setting carry over than I think that it does make sense to transpose them to an<br>administrative setting. So when looking<br>to see whether a rule or principle would be applicable in a quasi-judicial<br>administrative hearing I think that courts have two options: (1) what does the<br>organic statute say, and/or (2) what policy measures support the legal principle<br>in its organic domain (usually the judicial realm) and whether those would also<br>support the adoption in the administrative setting. It does seem that the policies supporting<br>preclusion in the judicial setting would easily be adaptable to the administrative<br>setting. It does not seem to me that<br>economy, fairness and finality would NOT be transferable to the administrative<br>setting. </p><p> That<br>paragraph is, basically, surplusage since
Texas</p><p>case law has long held that the<br>principles of both claim and issue preclusion may be applied to administrative<br>settings under the same three limitations. In the judicial setting where subsequent litigants argue claim<br>preclusion I suspect that much of the analysis will turn on whether the<br>decision was on the merits. In the<br>administrative setting I suspect that much of the analysis in a case of first<br>impression will have to turn on the competent tribunal setting. This is an important analysis point and an<br>important limitation on the doctrine when applied to administrative<br>bodies. I do not suspect that society is<br>interested in recognizing the authority of a governmental body when that body<br>does not have the proper statutory or societal authority; or operates under<br>such a loose set of principles and rules that its decisions are fully<br>arbitrary; or does not allow grievances to be actually heard but merely makes<br>the decision that appears the best without giving due process to those who are<br>protesting. Yet if an administrative<br>body does operate under a certain grant of authority and does offer due process<br>and does operate under some guise of rules that lend authority to its rulings<br>then it makes sense that we should “listen to it.” </p><p> The<br>other hard analysis is whether the decision of the administrative agency is<br>final. Obviously subsequent litigation<br>should not be precluded if the quasi-judicial body was only tabling the matter<br>until the agency fixed something. Conversely subsequent litigation should be precluded if the quasi-judicial<br>body was rendering an actual, binding ruling. This analysis, though facially simple, may not always be so easy in the<br>real world. I am fascinated by municipal<br>politics and have been known to watch Channel 3 while in
Nashville</p><p>. I have seen the looseness under which some of these Boards operate<br>under. I have read the entire protest<br>hearing transcript in this case which only confirms my suspicion that these<br>hearings are not formal trials (and they should not be). The problem is for this case that at the<br>first hearings the board merely retained the tax liability as it was prior to<br>the first renoticing. But did that mean<br>that they were tabling the matter so the agency could fix the procedural<br>problems or did it mean that they were ruling on the merits. Although there is some bleed over into the<br>other element, the crux of the matter is here. </p><p> Our<br>case tends to resolve itself here since even if they were tabling it they still<br>sent out a notice that said that it was the final ruling of the ARB. </p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
