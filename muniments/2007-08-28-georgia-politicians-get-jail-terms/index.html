Russia &ldquo;bombed&rdquo; Georgia.  The bomb was a dud that landed in some farmer’s backyard about half-way between Tbilisi (the capital) and the border with Russia.  There were a lot of odd things about that that I thought at the time but cannot currently remember.  Nonetheless it was sketchy at best. </p><p>Saakashvili, Georgia’s president, was supposed to meet with Putin in order to quell some of the tensions, (at least ostensibly) but I am not sure whether that happened or not.  Whether it did or not seems immaterial to this inflaming further tensions between the two.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
