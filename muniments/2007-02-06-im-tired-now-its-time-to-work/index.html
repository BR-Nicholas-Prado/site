hello.
this weekend was pretty amazingly long. in a good way i guess. except for i had a lot of work that could have been done, but i never got around to it. it is mitigated by the fact that none of it was actually due this weekend, i just wanted to get started on it. that can happen later i guess.
the weekend basically began on wednesday when we hosted our own welcome aboard party and some friends came over for american game night."><meta name=keywords content="legaltech,resilience,authoritarianism"><meta name=robots content="noodp"><meta name=theme-color content><link rel=canonical href=https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007-02-06-im-tired-now-its-time-to-work/><title>i&amp;#8217;m tired&amp;#8230;now its time to work. :: underWater desert Blogging — A Site About Resilience and Authoritarianism</title><link href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flag-icon-css/3.2.1/css/flag-icon.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=/main.min.84ed5579024525d4b50458514d1a43e40dd5272df45c7cd6da85b225af457154.css><meta itemprop=name content="i&amp;#8217;m tired&amp;#8230;now its time to work."><meta itemprop=description content="[![030207_1246][2]][2]
