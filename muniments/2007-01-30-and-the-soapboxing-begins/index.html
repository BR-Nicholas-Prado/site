It is fulfilling the picture I had in created over the six months or so of anticipation. People who have been here longer than I tend to ask the obvious question to fill the small talk obligation. “So how do you like Freetown.” “I like it fine, it is pretty close to what I had expected.” And so the conversations tend to begin. The amount of latent physical beauty that surrounds this place is stunning. And yet it is hard to make the claim that this city, at least, is idyllic because of the human tragedy and suffering that currently exists. You look one way you see one thing. You look another way you see something different. And often these two are as disparately disconnected as these two pictures are from one another. And yet this had been expected. What hadn’t been expected is the low amount of harassment by beggars for money. I was prepared for it to be constant considering that the last time I was in Jamaica it was some of the worst amount of begging I’ve ever experiences and considering that much of the original population of Sierra Leone were freed Jamaican slaves. They have had extremely divergent experiences, but at least they come from the same blood lines. But I must be careful b/c that is a completely different tangent which I do not want to progress in this short introductory note. Instead of not being able to walk anywhere for wading through crowds of outstretched hands, instead of that we are barely noticed as my housemate and I make our daily walks to the Lebanese supermarket. I must write in a future post about the Lebanese mafia in this town. They fascinate and frighten me. But they have good pita breads, and bobaghanous in a can and hummus in a can and olives, and chocolates, and nice teas and nice coffees and a few other niceties. There is no produce in the supermarket. For a while I was confused by this, until I realized that I have to talk to the lady out in the parking lot who had her wares assembled for my viewing and smelling pleasures. It is tropical here, so the citrus is great, the mangoes are to die for, the bananas are odd but tasty the guavas and cucumbers and star fruit etc are all delightful. There aren’t many tomatoes, but you can find them if you know where to look. Luckily I’ve found someone on my walk who sells nice tomatoes, even if they are a bit underripe. I like them that way, ripened to my precise specifications. We walk home up the hill loaded down with that evening’s groceries and a few bottles of water. Camels plodding up to the trough. It is usually dark by then, but it is strangely nice to be walking in the heat, loaded with groceries. You feel a part of it all. Although we do not carry our stuff on our heads. It is cliché I realize to associate that with Africa in general, but it is a way of life here. Kids will carry dining tables on their heads, men will carry two cement bags on their heads, women will carry bundles of 12 foot long poles on their heads. It is amazing. But we don’t carry them on our heads. We do, however, sweat. We are always sweaty heaps when we knock on our gate and the guards let us in our compound. Without fail we will bring the two on duty a soda. We feel that it is just a good way of living our lives. Maybe they would prefer a little extra cash, but Cokes taste pretty good on a hot evening. Not to me though, as I’m still soda free. More disconnection coming in the future. I just wanted to give you a small sampling. ~ # ~</p><p>[]: <a href=http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/image001.jpg>http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/image001.jpg</a>
