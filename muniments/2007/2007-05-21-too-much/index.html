heart-breaking, remarkable, human, surprising and wonderful.  my friends had been planning for all week to go upcountry, but seeing that it was highlands next to last weekend here and it was looking like we would be able to spend a good deal of time together that was more important to me.  i thought i could figure out a way to get upcountry later, even though the rains are coming (btw i know now what the phrase feels like…at least a little bit).  then due to some work-related B.S. it turned out that highlands was going to have to work ALL weekend. </p><p>i thought that it would then be ridiculous to stay here and just sit on my bum all weekend when everyone else that i cared about was upcountry having fun.  so i decided to go.  the only question was how the hell to get up country to meet them.  they had a car that blazed our identity to anyone who knows just a little bit.  the license plate is blue and has a nice code which reveals our identity to all who know.  yet, they were already in bo the second largest city in sierra leone.  and i was six hours away in freetown.  i put my white boy-ness aside for a bit and thought that africans are doing it all the time.  so i went downstairs to talk to my guards about the who/what/when/where/why.  they told me that if i got on the poda-poda bus at like 4 in the morning i could get up to bo by 8 or so.  i decided it was all systems go.</p><p>woke up at four in the morning on saturday to begin the adventure.  hopped on the back of a motorcycle taxi to go downtown to the place where the buses are.  met up with some folks to find out the correct bus.  at about 5:30 the bus finally got underway.  they sit us five across, so i did not have enough room to get the money out of my pocket to pay (later in the morning).  for the first part it was quiet as everyone was sleepy.  but it was still like every movie i’ve ever seen with the one white human on the developing country bus.  i was smooshed in with all the africans who were going to see family and what not.  it was loud and hot and bumpy and hot and dusty and hot and smelly and hot.  it was great!  i had my bag on my lap and just gaiped through the entire five hour ride.  got up to bo about 1030 in the morning, hopped on a different motorcycle taxi and met up with my friends.</p><p>all along the ride i was surprised at how open everything was.  freetown is really really congested, but once you get outside of freetown there is so much space and air.  the space feels larger due to all the deforestation (but that is a different post entirely).  feng shui aside, it was beautiful countryside.  will put up picts when i can get some bandwidth.  the little villages we passed along the way were neat and orderly.  the houses were all in lines not helterskelter, there was zero trash lying around, the cooking pits and wells and toilets were all clearly dilineated, even to my eye as 60 kph on a bus with dust covered windows.</p><p>we trolleyed off in the car after i met up with them towards kenema.  on our way we saw all these kool villages and decided to stop at one.  these villages were the real deal.  i mean it was AFRICA.  it was authentic.  it was real.  it hasn’t changed in centuries.  they live in clay houses.  first they build with sticks cut down from medium-sized trees with machetes a lattice-work and then they fill in the holes with mud.  it is like building with bricks, but not.  they put on a roof of palm fronds which doesn’t really work in the rainy season.  we sat around in their community center chatting with them about the seasons, voting preference, voting knowledge, how to farm corn, what it is like to have cobras biting your chilren when they are supposed to be learning their three R’s, the perils of having people use the toilet wherever they like, the intricacies of soccer in the bush, proper cutlass (machete) technique, stories old legends and other topics which i cannot currently remember.  there were a few men eloquent in english and the rest sort of stood around and listened.  we toured the place and took tons of pictures.  they have, in this village of less than 200, a mosque and a church.  they pay for their own teacher as it is too far for the kids to walk to school.  they grow rice and beans and corn and other vegetables and coconuts and mangoes and papaya.  they cook as a community.  it was crazy. </p><p>i would have stayed there all afternoon just talking, but we had other things to do.  rolled out and rocked up to kenema town.  there wasn’t much of a place to park, except for at the radio station.  we got out and of course tons of africans piled out to see the aputus (white people in mende). since we continually pay the complexion tax and get charged more for everything we buy i figured we should turn in some of that so i asked if we could get a tour of the radio station.  they were happy to comply.  so we got a tour of the little kenema radio station which broadcasts for a quarter of this country the bbc feed and other local programming.  the station manager gave me some good leads on good, older SL music. </p><p>we walked around in the stifling heat, sweating.  saw crazy, sketchy diamond dealers, a few other notable things.  then we rocked out of town to see this catholic mission.  it was beautiful and wide open with lines of coconut palm trees planted in orderly fashion, old buildings in a college like campus environ.  the beautiful hills were backset and the beautiful people were foreset.  it was wonderfully relaxing.  we all thought it would be brilliant if freetown had a place where you could go, sit outside in the shade on a blanket and read a book or take a picnic too.  but alas, freetown is too crazy for that.</p><p>then we wanted to see some diamond mines.  it was the ostensible reason for the trip, so we decided to do it.  we hired a motorbike taxi to lead us out to this famous place, tongo fields.  but first a sidebar.  there are two types of mining that are done in SL, the first is alluvial mining.  this is the sifting of the river that you saw in blood diamonds, over the years the diamonds work their way to the surface and then flow down the rivers.  this is done by two man crews.  the second is called kimberlite mining, this is the more traditional &ldquo;mining&rdquo; where there are veins which are diamond rich and the company has to bore down into the earth to get it.  this is industrial with caterpillars and dynamite etc.  if you want to read more check <a href=http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2001/pac-sie-jan00.pdf>here</a>.  tongo fields which is outside of kenema town is the largest kimberlite vein in SL.  after talking to person after person we worked our way out to tongo fields, past a couple of alluvial, artisinal mining pits and many artisinal miners.  we first had to go to the main diamond office, it was the certification people who are in charge of ensuring that the diamonds are certified as conflict free.  they work for the government.  the first guy took us to his bosses house.  the boss was having a bbq in the back yard with some friends.  there were a few beers around and a deer head on the fire pit.  i’m not kidding. </p><p>this guy took us to another guy who worked at the koidu holdings diamond mine (the big, industrial one).  that guy took us to the gate. we talked to the security gaurds and then to a policeman and then to another governmental certification guy and finally to the chief of security for the entire mine.  we weren’t able to talk our way inside, neither were we able to bribe our way inside. </p><p>so we got back in the car as we wanted to return to bo before nightfall and had a long way to go.  had a low tire on the way home, but filled it up and luckily it held air so we kept going and made it back to the &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; in bo.  it wasn’t bad, similar to a shitty roadside hotel in nowhere’sville ar-kansas.  had a bit of dinner which was two small fishes bbqed over coal pit and some rice and a little salad which will likely fill me with typhoid virsuses.  then, having been up since four in the morning, i was too exhausted to stay awake to debrief for the day so i fell asleep.</p><p>the next morning we got up with the intention of just driving home; little did he know what adventures lay before him.  after a breakfast of toast and a fried egg and some butter we piled in the car.  this day it was my day to drive.  there were three of us who wanted to drive, urs drove the first day, jason drove the second day, and it was my turn the third day.  lynn didn’t want to drive and brett doesn’t know how to drive manual.  idiot. </p><p>first we toured, quickly the city of bo, including a stop to put in some diesel in the tank of a land cruiser that we were driving.  also had to fill up the tire again which was still holding on, but had gone a little low over the night.  then we got a wild hair that we wanted to go see the grave of one of the warlords that was indicted by the court here and has recently died.  he is a legend and a very controversial figure b/c most SL’s think that he was the only thing that kept this country together and most of them wonder why he was indicted by the court.  that, also, is another post entirely.  but in the part of the country where we were the court is NOT liked one iota.  and here we were rocking out with a vehicle that might as well have our employer’s name posted on the side like the NGO’s that rock around here.  we figured it was stupid so why not. </p><p>in bo we hired another motorbike taxi to take us out to this village that was &ldquo;eight&rdquo; miles away (read 38) down this bush road.  he led and i followed in the tank down bush road after bush road.  at one point the bush grass formed, essentially, a tunnel that i was forced to go through.  if i can get the video up here i will.  the grass was smacking the car on both sides and i have zero clue what the hell i was supposed to do if there was oncoming traffic.  luckily the only thing we saw oncoming was a few men on bikes loaded down with water and fuel jerry cans. </p><p>we drove down the roads and got to the village where we had to turn off.  we rocked up to the police station and talked to some elders of the village that were standing outside the station, then we drove down a couple of houses to talk to the paramount chief (read..essentially…major of the county), this was the guy who replaced the legendary warlord.  after a little talking to a bunch of people and exchanges of gifts and a beer we piled an ex-combatant nephew of the warlord into the passenger seat and then surrounded ourselves with four motorbikes loaded down with the warlord’s followers for the three mile drive up to his grave.  it was a four-wheel-drive road up into the hills and it was brilliantly beautiful. </p><p>we finally got to the warlord’s village and took pictures with his brother at his mausoleum.  then hightailed it out of there.  the nephew, who lives in freetown, asked a couple of us under his breath what our &ldquo;real mission was&rdquo;.  we’re pretty sure that he knew who we worked for but didn’t say anything to anyone else, or if he did, they didn’t care.  we dropped off the nephew at the bottom of the hill to continue their ceremony of the five year anniversary of his father’s death party/gathering that we had interrupted when we rolled up.  he said we were the first white people since the burial to roll out there.  very interesting!</p><p>then the road, if possible, got even more hairy.  we passed by this town really, truly in the bush called yele.  there was an SDA mission there with a primary school and a secondary school.  they were actually quite large.  i thought maybe i could stop and meet someone from andrews or southern, but decided against it.  we got up the road farther and stopped in a village to confirm that we were going the correct way and asked them how much further to this one town…of course the answer was only a few miles.  SLeans are good at some things, but they are AWEFUL at distances, everything was 5 miles…even when it is 30 miles!  anyway the guy said yeah it is just up the road five miles, you go past the ferry and then you’ll see it.  i started to pull the car away and then something clicked…ferry?  so i reversed and asked him what he meant about ferry and he said that it was a town named ferry.  my heart slowed down.  that would have been too much adventure.  my foot was already getting tired from constantly shifting up and down.  i know, i know, i’m kind of a pansy, but this was 6 hours into a long bush drive where the longest i was in one gear was only a matter of minutes. </p><p>the road becomes impossible and suddenly we come up to a bridge that we think has a huge hole in it.  but it was only our perspective, actually there were logs covering the hole.  so jason got out to inspect and he thought everything was OK.  i thought, hell the drop is only 15 feet if it collapses.  everyone gets out of the vehicle save me.  i remember wondering as i drove slowly onto the bridge whether the tank had airbags or not.  luckily i never had to find out, the logs held the tanks and i got across without incident.  that, to me, was the most sketchy thing about the bush roads, what if one of the bridges we were crossing every five minutes went out.  i mean we had 4WD, but still….anyway we get on up through village after impossibly small village…all deserted b/c it was sunday and most of them (we think) were at church. then we pass through a larger town with a market, i go around a road block, down a gorge and suddenly there is a river and there is no bridge over it.  the FERRY!</p><p>the ferry is essentially a huge wooden barge and there is a cable that runs from one bank to another that the barge is clipped too.  there are men who man the barge and they manually pull it from one side to the other by tugging on the cable.  so they tug across to ourside and then the tank, us and some bike dudes drive/walk/ride onto the barge.  then the rest of them pulled her across the river…wait till you see the picts of this!  i’m not even to the hairy part of this oregon trail journey yet.  on the other side they couldn’t get the landing ramp fitted onto the bank correctly b/c there was a gigantic hole which i wasn’t going to be able to drive the tank across!  but eventually they got some logs situated and jason (who by the way works in northern canada as a manager of oil rigs and is here visiting lynn (his fiance) for a few months as they cannot really work right now while the land is defrosting) supervised it, so i felt better.  across the tank went and then up the hill.  4Low baby!  then we had good roads all the way back to freetown, rolled into town to a gorgeously clear day where the bay was glistening with the nice sunset. </p><p>FABULOUS!</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor"
