that we just needed a light in the kitchen.  It was of no moment to me that she has a cook who she treats like shit and we cook for ourselves, I wasn’t bothered by the fact that she was never in there.  We were and she needed to provide a lamp for us.</p><p>So she conceded to buy a lamp and she told Ibrahim to go out the next day and buy a lamp.  Backflash a few days.  The light in Brett’s room wasn’t working and he had asked Ibrahim to buy a small reading light for him.  So Ibrahim had recently bought this little reading light for Brett, one of those small things that you clip onto the books.  But Brett’s also had a stand and you could plug it in. </p><p>When the landlord asked Ibrahim to buy a lamp for the kitchen he bought another of these little reading things.  It didn’t light the kitchen as well as the small light in the fridge, but at least we didn’t have to leave the door open to the fridge and let our food further spoil!!!!  I used to tell this story as a funny bit to illustrate how easily things could get lost in translation.</p><p>Then a bit later I walked out of my compound and was heading down the hill to congo cross (the big intersection) to catch a cab and go somewhere…posh, i’m sure, and as I passed one of the little shack-villes i saw that there were seven people sitting around one of these little lights. it clicked for me then that it wasn’t lost in translation, this was what they knew.  Ibrahim didn’t know any better, I think.  To him that was a lamp to light a room. </p><p>It broke my heart for a lot of reasons. </p><p>The second story ends with the following phrase: so at least now I’ve had my alone, car broke down, no money and no phone in a third world country miles from no where story.  You’ll have to ask me that one over a beer! </p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/5fcb7aa062576518427ace5cf4afcb1b6f85686f target=_blank rel=noopener>5fcb7aa</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
