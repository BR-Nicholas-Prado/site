It seems, to me, that the other thing that is happening is that it keeps my bookmarks clean.  Anally retentive people’s ears perk up at this.  I can just go to mySpace and find out about organizations rather than having to open each in a separate tab in my firefox browser (i find it amusing that the firefox browser tags itself as a misspelled word). 
Have just seen the MySpace Impact Awards.  Apparently MySpace gives these away every quarter, or month or something.  It is a $10k grant, but more importantly (for most organizations) is the free advertising that MySpace will deliver to its 40Zillion users.  The criteria for winning are supposedly:</p><blockquote><p>The Committee will select three (3) finalists from all entries eligible<br>for the Grand Prize that are received during the Contest Submission<br>Period based on the discretion of each of the judges, based on the<br>following judging criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):  25% relevance to<br>the month’s category, 25% use of MySpace toolset to promote the cause<br>(i.e. good profile design, incorporating multi-media, active engagement<br>with the MySpace community, etc.), 25% breadth of reach and appeal, and<br>25% fit with the culture of MySpace.
I included the criteria because it is interesting how subjective it all is.  Hipsters judging hipsters.  Nevertheless.  They have six main categories, they seem to rotate every month or quarter whenever the award is given:

Find something you care about, get involved.  Do some good.
