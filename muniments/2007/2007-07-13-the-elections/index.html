their speeches were.  they would nearly always begin at the beginning and give me the entire landscape with all its attendent complicating and simplifying factors from the 1968 elections up to the currently scheduled election, the traditional lines of support and the various tribal and chiefdom factors as they applied traditionally and currently.  one thing that struck me is how simple, yet complex within a given culture and situation, the game of politics is.  it is very straightforward and seemingly easy to play.  yet one must still remain within the systemic and cultural constraints, and these often provide the complications. </p><p>the international crisis group has just yesterday published a <a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/getfile.cfm?id=3016&tid=4942&type=pdf&l=1">report</a> about the upcoming elections.   if you are interested in a western synopsis of the above, granted without the flair of the happy krio accent and grandiose hand gestures.</p><p>there are three main candidates: solomon berewa, charles margai and ernest koroma.  berewa is the current vice-president, leader of the SLPP and current frontrunner.  he generally represents a semi-compentence with a bit of international credibility, yet he has essentially been running the country since 2002 and so represents the status quo to many saloneance.  margai is the old gadfly who has been buzzing about salone politics for years, formerly SLPP and currently the leader of the newly formed PMDC.  he seems to have much to prove and overly eager, there is something about him that seethes corruption to me.  koroma is the wild-card and head of the APC.  no one seems very sure of him, although he is a bit younger than the others they all represent (to most saloneans i spoke with) shades of gray.  no one brings any true hope or really engages the imagination of the people.  this is a shame on all levels i can possibly think of.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/16033dfb5f6cfc36e05b1b6f2afcb2943819f692 target=_blank rel=noopener>16033df</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy;
