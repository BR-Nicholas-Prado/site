Recommend!…</p><blockquote><p>No one knows.</p><p>No one knows.</p><p>Running a race to nowhere lookin’ to share a little love along the way.</p><p>Running a race to nowhere lookin’ to share a little love along the way.</p><p>Running a race to nowhere lookin’ to share a little love along the way.</p><p>Running a race to nowhere against who and not sure why, but already miles, tired, confused as to where my motivation is supposed to come from.</p><p>Millions of generations before me fought unsuccessfully for the same beliefs I now stand for.</p><p>With hands & feet bonded, speaking through duct taped lips, in an unknown language, tongue-tied with mouth full of assorted jelly bellies</p><p>Wondering how many battered voices is it going to take to make a word, a sentence, a phrase, a manifesto, to make a difference.</p><p>Gallons of tears collected, but not enough to make a flow, my river is better defined as a puddle of piss on a sidewalk corner.</p><p>But a girl has to start somewhere.</p><p>Crying for my puddle’s preservation.</p><p>Realizing that it is easier and cheaper to live in the dark, but that the brightness and warmth from lying naked without sunscreen at twleve in the sun is a pain I prefer because</p><p>I can see.</p><p>I can see the ones who feel the same and are unashamed of their naked existence, trapped in their own respective concerns, blinded by the brightness, desperate in an unknown space.</p><p>Wishing only to grab hands with one who does to another, creating a bond formed because of this shared experience.</p><p>Comforting me, while I do to you, joining us in solitude, simply by the fact that –</p><p>Isolation only exists in one’s thoughts. </p><p>Isolation only exists in one’s thoughts.</p></blockquote><p>The main thing that I ping off of is the stuff at the beginning, rather than the latter.  The communal stuff, to a certain extent, I feel that I have found.  It is not so much hands to hold it is the frustration that the holding of hands needs to occur in order to divert the river’s flow from where it currently is to where millions of others wish that it will go.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/6c6bbc31b913d5299b542159e6c2cb7ae47fb7bf target=_blank rel=noopener>6c6bbc3</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
