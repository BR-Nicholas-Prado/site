i couldn’t tell, or at least i couldn’t identify it.  everything was mushed together: a crushed pot-pie of thoughts and ideas, of visions and plans.  some will come to fruition and some are lost.  some things were more poignant than others, some problems seemed to crush me and some seemed acceptable or at least cope-able.  then i started wondering about the foreboding nature of the conclusions i was drawing based upon my thoughts.  nothing is that fatalistic, good can still be accomplished.  sometimes it may require a certain amount of subrogation, nevertheless i guess that is what is supposed to happen.  action and inaction, are different sides of the same coin, right?</p><p>it struck me, as i rode with some friends in a small boat down to the beach that i visited five weeks ago, how little time i’ve spent here.  sometimes it seems like a long time, but mostly it feels like i just arrived.  objectively i’m a quarter of the way through my original contract, which ends the end of june.  i wonder how in the hell i’m 25% completed?  i just arrived.  i’ve been here such a small amount of time.  my feet are barely dry from the states.  where has it gone? i still cannot get access to some of the dataBases at work, and yet i’m tracking towards some sort of return at some point in the future. </p><p>the boat was not always up to the waves thrown at it during portions of the hour and a half trip and a few of the Brits (good, sea-faring people that they are) felt it necessary to put on life jackets.  yet, i wondered why they felt it was necessary to don them since shore was no more than a 100 meters away, 200 at most.  i refused. the waves weren’t that big, but the boats here ride low to the water and so maybe the magnitude gets magnified.</p><p>i read for a while at the beach and could not focus on the now for thoughts of the past.  it was a history book and i could not help but think about the parrallels to &ldquo;our current situation with that camel fucker in iraq,&rdquo; as well as other current situations on a world-wide scale.  why do we get involved with things only to fuck them up?  why do we stubbornly stick around and take all the blame from the media when most of may be accurate and, yet, most of it is truly reactionary? </p><p>i became tired.  tired of my book, tired of my uncertainties, tired of wondering, tired of planning, tired of caring so damn much about too many fucking things without being able to express or do anything about any of it, tired of making myself feel guilty about everything done and undone and redone and not-done, tired of feeling good and bad about myself, tired of looking forward and back and down and up, tired.  so i took a nap and got sunburned.  which is ok and — likely — symbolically accurate.</p><p>i came home and later went to the one place where i can have introverted moments.  a small hotel within walking distance of my house where no expats go.  african big men from around the sub-region come to smoke cigars and talk geo-politics.  i wondered when i left if they would think i am a spy.  which would be awesome.  maybe i now have a tail and don’t know it.  which would also be awesome.  i sat and watched the sun set to my left and began again to wonder about the seasonal and daily oscillations and whether i’m destined to continue or whether i can ever actually get them under control.  i wondered if anything was ever going to be able to be reconciled within my head?  would my desires (long-term, medium-term, short-term) ever align?  or have i created a situation that has judged me guilty and set me on a continually self-perpetuating cycle of … of what?  i don’t know, but it all cycles.</p><p>i walked home and thought about the tension, do i look up?  everyone around here keeps their head up.  not sure if it is because they are so used to carrying things on their head, or if the social norms dictate that you not look down, or if it is a pride thing.  yet, at home i always watch were i’m going on a more specific and less general level.  this has been a skill that serves me well here where the ditches are random and deep and filled with sewage, where the potholes will break your ankle, even while walking, and where the puddles are likely filled with parasites of unthinkable (to me) voracity. </p><p>and yet i don’t know if i’m supposed to look down at where i’m going or up at where i’m going?  am i supposed to look behind me or look ahead and wait for a car or a light to illuminate the shadows of those walking behind me? is it easier to assess their probability of picking my pocket by pretending to not pay attention while keeping aware of their presence, or should i really turn around and assess from a proper perspective?  but at any rate it is usually moot because they couldn’t really care less if i was there or not and they just pass me as i walk at my new-found Africa pace, which is to say…slow.</p><p>i stopped along the way and helped some men push a dead taxi cab a long ways.  they were amazed that i did it, but thankful for the extra set of legs which were not as strong as their’s, but helpful to some extent.  it put a few things in perspective: the exertion (it was a long ways).  yet, i cannot quite put a finger on what perspective or what things they were.  at least i could see a bit clearer, the fog wasn’t so deep.  i thought of my heritage and how pushing cars and visions of my dad have affected both my perspective and my trajectory.  have i chosen this perpetual longing for something unattainable, or is my climb up the sand dune not my choice, some wierd conflagration of nature and nurture combined to explode in my head like a chemistry experiment gone bad? i certainly could have chosen not to help them push the car, but what would my heritage think about that?  is it better to regret doing or to regret cowardice or to regret both or to not regret at all? </p><p>today? today i cannot concentrate and feel the fog is pervasive. i have been asked questions, serious questions, and am getting them all convuluted.  all of the answers are swirling and i am having difficulty putting together which answer fragment goes with which question. </p><p>maybe i just need some ritalin.  that seems to cure everything, right?  maybe i just need to figure out my entire life.  maybe i just need to stop caring.  maybe i just need to realize that tensions will always exist, without them life would be much more boring.  or maybe, that like two fingers squeezing a slimy watermelon seed, pressure is the only way to move forward, and i should revel that when the fog clears a path may be slightly clearer.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-git-commit"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="4"/><line x1="1.05" y1="12" x2="7" y2="12"/><line x1="17.01" y1="12" x2="22.96" y2="12"/></svg><a href=https://github.com/compleatang/site/commit/16033dfb5f6cfc36e05b1b6f2afcb2943819f692 target=_blank rel=noopener>16033df</a> @ 2020-04-10</p></div></main></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=footer__content><span>&copy; 2020</span>
