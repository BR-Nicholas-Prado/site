Guns are a high risk activity. Fine, we have lots of high risk activities and over time American culture has developed mechanisms for dealing with these high risk activities. And it is my opinion that these could be leveraged in a way that will bring down our love of guns.

Let us say you drive a car. Car driving is a high risk activity. So what do we do. We do three things. First we track you and the car you are driving. Both the public sector, i.e. us,  have a role to play in that, as well as the private sector. Second we require from each other that we all buy insurance. This is not for the benefit of the driver. It is primarily for the benefit of the drivers victims. Third we are incentivize the manufacturers of cars to make the vehicles as safe - for those inside and for those outside the vehicle - as possible via products liability and other tort mechanisms.

All three of these methodologies are available to us to the begin to change the culture of gun ownership in America. While I am all for assualt weapon bans and greater legislative restrictions on ammunition purchases, it is my opinion that those will only get us so far.  Of course the entertainment industry needs to look at how it glamorizes violence. Of course mental health care should be increased.

## One. Tracking is Essential - Even if Imperfect



## Three. Litigious Enforcement of a New Risk Paradigm

But all these measures get at the symptoms rather than the causes. The causes are the arms and ammunition manufacturers profit tallies. Their ability to not face product liability suits is nonsensical. They have absolutely no incentive to put money into developments of smarter safety mechanisms, like the James Bond fingerprint ID for guns. Or to market existing less than lethal options (rubber bullets, bean bag shells, etc.) more heavily than lethal options. These incentives could easily be modified if the arms and ammunition manufacturers were "allowed" to face the same scrutiny that nearly every other manufacturer faces.

Bartenders can be sued by the victims of a drunk driver if they sell more drinks to the inebriated person when the bartender has a reasonable suspicion will be driving. Why? Because it makes sense. To some. The victims didn't take the risk. The driver took most of it, but the bartender had some risk too. He or she made money by selling his items to someone he or she had a reasonable suspicion that they could do something nepharious after they made the purchase and because they made the purchase. How are gun shop owners getting off the hook here? What is the public policy exception that empowers then to avoid liability if they have a reasonable suspicion that someone may misuse they products?
