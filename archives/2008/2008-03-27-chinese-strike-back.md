The [Tibetan protests][3], the [crackdown by the Chinese][4] and the [backlashes from civil societies][5] around the world offer me a good opportunity to explore differing viewpoints.  Essentially, I know so little of what is going on there that I hesitate to offer comments.  But the link above struck me because it is very counter–philosophy.

I like going to [Global Voices ][6]because they usually have excellent links to interesting prose and other voices.  So running an article about how the Chinese Bloggers are defending their government and deriding the poor, peaceful Tibetan protesters who only want to get on with their Buddhist meditations adds an interesting twist to my thinking.  Of course there are many sides to this story.  Duh.

I associate Free Tibet Movement with other early 90s civil society ideas (which seemed to fail or remain stagnant more often than "succeed" however that could be measured) such as Save the Whales and Save the Rainforest and End Apartheid.  My concept of the situation is shaped from voyeuristic understanding of the situation.  I am more focussed on poverty and Africa rather than self-determination and Asia.  At the end of the day, the Free Tibet movement is off my radar screen.  That said I still find it fascinating.  

The Global Voices piece could simply be exposing Chinese Government surrogates who "blog" neutrally, or it could be proffering a different view on the situation.  I know not which it is, but still love the fact that it has added an additional, nuanced layer to the debate.  Hopefully to the betterment of the Movement.  

If the Movement takes this as an attack on its existence rather than an opportunity to engage in a good debate about what it is doing than I challenge it to stop playing by a conservative dichotomized playbook and join the pomo crowd who makes up much of its membership (I suspect).
