summary: 'When I was a young Marine Officer, I was in the depths of a dirty used bookstore
  in DC when this old timer came up to me.  I was in the Military History section
  trying to find this one book I was supposed to read and we struck up a conversation.

  remember the way he slapped me on the back and said with a particular gleam: ''Semper
  Fi, Mac, Semper Fi.''  He had served his time, now I’ve served mine.  My contractual
  commitment ended on New Year’s.  It is odd, in a way I miss having that connection
  hanging over my head. '
