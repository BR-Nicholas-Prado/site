so cam and i talked for about two hours the other evening; the conversation began at 0130 my time.  i was tired the next day.  

one of the things which we were discussing is a fear that we share which is why haven’t our views been implemented before.  it got me thinking about a poem by one of my favorite poems, [Taylor Mali][1] called "Running a Race".  I transcribe the lyrics below, please forgive me if the line breaks are a bit off as I’m manually doing the transcription.  His CD is available on his website or the songs are available on iTunes.  Highly! Recommend!…

The main thing that I ping off of is the stuff at the beginning, rather than the latter.  The communal stuff, to a certain extent, I feel that I have found.  It is not so much hands to hold it is the frustration that the holding of hands needs to occur in order to divert the river’s flow from where it currently is to where millions of others wish that it will go.
