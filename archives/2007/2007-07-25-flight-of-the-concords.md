summary: i have been sans telly now for about six months, so i’m not sure, but i think
  that this is a [show on HBO][1].  yeah, so googling proved that youtube is correct. 
  don’t know what the context/premise of the show is, but this clip that someone sent
  me is pretty damn hilarious. they also have a video podcast which is available on
  itunes as well as a bunch of videos on their HBO [page][2].  i’m sitting in a cafe
  listening to these with my headphones on, trying (and failing) not to look like
  a fool as i laugh so hard i’m crying.  wow, tv that i want to watch…exciting.
