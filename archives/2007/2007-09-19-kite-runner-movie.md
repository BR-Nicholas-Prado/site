summary: Just found out that Mark Forster, who directed Stranger Than Fiction, Finding
  Neverland and Monster’s Ball is directing the film adaptation of Kite Runner.  A
  very reputable NGO, International Rescue Group, who focuses on refugee issues among
  other things, has been consulting on the film.  I’m not sure if that lends the film
  an inordinate amount of credibility, but I think that it certainly lends some. 
  Hosseini co-wrote the screenplay so it may have a good following of the novel, which
  I haven’t read.  It is to be released state-side the beginning of November according
  to IMDb.
