I’m certainly no expert on Dutch culture or Dutch language, but can anyone tell me if there are even Dutch words for the following English equivalents:

*   Pardon Me.
*   Excuse Me.
*   I’m Sorry.
*   I Apologize.
*   It Was My Fault.

If there are, I certainly haven’t ever heard them.  Back in the land I love, or the land that I love to make fun of for the holidays.  Well, I’ll be in Scotland for the holidays proper but here in Hague before/afta.  

Nothing special to report, so Happy Holidays to all!
