summary: 'i’m not as huge a bush hater as many others who score similarly on political
  spectrum tests.  however, i continued to be amazed at the recalcitrant-ness of his
  administration.  throughout the short american constitutional history there have
  been contentious constitutional issues that have pitted the three branches of governance
  against each other in varying degrees of allied and opposition poses.: executive
  v. legislative, legislative v. judiciary, executive & legislative v. judiciary,
  etc.  however, the end to the tension usually comes (at least in the governance
  sector, even if it lingers in the civil & media sectors) when the supreme court
  rules on an issue.  if the court rules against one of the other branches in on a
  constitutional issue, its word is final.  full stop.  however when the court rules
  on other issues of law, adminsitrative, legislative, international then it may not
  be the final say.  the executive or legislative often will have a second crack even
  if one of their actions was nulled by a decision of the court.  that said, most
  times, the other branches second cracks will show much more deference to the legal
  reasoning which the court adopted (usually because a constitutional challenge to
  the second crack may be waiting in the wings and if the court has shown a leaning
  in a particular decision the legislative and executive would not want to get overturned
  on constitutional grounds as that would be the end of the story again).  but the
  bush executive branch seems to evince little of the traditional gentlemanliness
  with which this country has been governed for years.  latest in the saga of the
  Hamdan v. Rumsfeld decision is the executive issuing an executive order that CIA
  interrogation techniques, if conducted for the purpose of eliciting intelligence
  are per sae legal.  there are a few nuances in the order, first the techniques must
  not violate the McCain Ammendment against torture or dismemberment (but according
  to most human rights decisions this leaves a wide berth).  secondly, the techniques
  must not be conducted with the purpose of degrading the human.  well, shit, that
  just about guts the protections that the Hamdan decision offered to detainees at
  Guantanamo (and hopefully by extrapolation to other detention facilities, although
  there is no jurisprudence on point with regards to that issue — yet). '

two men with conservative pedigrees which few could attack have written an [OpEd in the Washington Post calling out the Administration][1] for this lack of deference and showing how wrong the decision is based upon common international legal interpretation principles.

i understand that we need to keep the country safe.  i have no quibble with national security scholars who dicker over specifics, but this is a bridge too far for me.  by simply saying that the purpose of the interrogation is paramount in any determination we are gutting the protections found in Common Article 3.  full stop.  the CIA will always be able to argue that it is interrogating for the purpose of eliciting intelligence, in fact it is all it does and even in the most degrading of treatments all they have to do is to ask a question (no matter how obvious or mundane) and then claim that the purpose was to gather intelligence.  once they get through the wicket then they are enable to do whatever they want per the text of the executive order.  

it seems that the administration is digging a hole to bury itself in needlessly.  there are other ways to protect yourself without stooping to tit for tat reciprocity.
