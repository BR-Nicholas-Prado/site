Things have been a bit chaotic with getting settled and then having that paper and another project for school hanging over my head. I finished the paper yesterday and the project just now, so I feel very refreshed. Now I can focus fully on the work here and then having fun. The beaches are delightful, apparently, and I’m excited to visit them soon.

Freetown is an amazing place and I am incredibly happy to be here. The people in the office are passionate and smart and caring. The people in town are warm and friendly, despite my whiteness. There is a bunch of pickpocketing, but other than that places are safe to go. We’re just being smart and being safe and all is good. Wait until I can break out the camera (maybe this weekend) and send you some pictures from here. It is so surreal to be in a place where people are walking around with bundles on their head, where creole is spoken everywhere, where the only water many have access to is runoff, where the colors of the buildings blow your mind, where the dust gets blown down from the sahara and mixes with the ocean breezes to create a thick haze that makes it difficult to see the ocean. 

Off to watch the film Blood Diamond in Freetown with the people that have been prosecuting and defending and adjudicating and living it for years.  Talk about surreal!
