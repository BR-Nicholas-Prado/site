[![Radiohead_in_rainbows2][2]][2]  
in case you’re an ostrich in a human’s body, or my dad, [radiohead has put out a new album][2], called in Rainbows.  it is only downloadable on the internet at this point.  it will come out in CD stores at some point in December, which basically requires you to ask WTF is the point of that.  nevermind.  the interesting thing about this is how they are doing it.  they have decided that there is no price point.  someone can pay anything they like from 1 pence (you pay in pounds…) to as high as you want.  they charge a 44 pence charge on your credit card, so the lowest you can pay is probably about $.90 depending on the exchange rate on a given date.  Nevertheless that is ridiculous.  I’m not going to tell you what I paid, but it was similar to what I pay for iTunes albums.  I will be interested to hear what kind of information they get out of it.

the real point here is that the album is rich.  and i don’t mean to speak to its pecuniary interests.  it seems to me, after two not-incredibly close listens, that it is the continuation of a cohesive narrative arc beginning with the bends and running through OK directly to this album.  although it seems to integrate some parts of the kid A/amnesiac sidebar, as well as a lot of the things i enjoyed from hail to the thief.  it seems different than those two albums.  maybe i’ll be editing this later, not sure and recanting on my words.  but for now, that is my thought.
