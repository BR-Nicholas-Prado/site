the following is a new treatise that represents some of my current thought patterns.  those that know me [everyone that reads this blog] knows of my mobile ways in geography but in many aspects of my life.  

my brother has been applying to grad schools and he and i have been bantering regarding his personal statement.  he recently told me that he has lost his mojo and he doesn’t seem to have any motivation to really put his heart into the document.  i replied: 

shouldn’t fear of becoming what your stereotypes  
dictate you should become enough?  has always been for me.  do you  
want THIS to continue?

to which he replied:  

I don’t really get your drift…  
Do I want WHAT to continue?

to which i replied:  EXACTLY

but then i wrote the following.
