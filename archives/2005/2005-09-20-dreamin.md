last night i had this extremely lucid dream where one of my eyebrows was gone and the other was super bushy.

think that it means that i’m betraying my fair and balanced-ness and putting too much time into one area of my life.  the unfortunate thing is that isn’t going to change for many many years.

sometimes i’ll be in class or reading and have this really weird sensation creep through and past me, surreal visions of oak and courtrooms and i think i’m going to be doing this?
