so this weekend past we did our mock trial competition.  yale did phenomenally well.  she made it past the preliminaries and is now in the final four (she and her partner found out today).  

team korea (my team) didn’t champion the effort to the extent that their girlfriends did.  i was really pissed about it for a while.  much of that came from the inherrent pressure that is always present, pushing upon my insides from my outsides.  but once i got past this i really started to unpack the dissappointment i realized that much of my dissappointment was because when i didn’t know the procedural possibilities i felt handcuffed.  

see, we knew the arguments to make, i did fine in torts.  but i didn’t know how to make them.  i cannot just pick up a manual and learn something.  i need to be empowered by seeing something happen in front of me.  

so i have decided to run to run the thing next year.  

the major thing that i want to change is to push the preliminaries back a week.  it was pretty harsh to have it the first weekend when we got back, a weekend we all wanted to enjoy.  but during that first weekend back i would put on a seminar.

the optional seminar will empower people like me to really dig deep.  by giving them the tools that they didn’t have before it will allow them to make some really good arguments.  

i’m planning to run the seminar the way i’ve learned to teach people.  edip style.  explain, demonstrate, immitate, practice.  start with some classes on (how to question, speculation, hearsay, entering evidence, decorum essentials, opens/closes, tactical/strategy basics), followed by part of trial that we would demonstrate for them.  then i’d break the students into small groups and let the 1l’s coach them.

this will empower people like me that know the arguments to make but get a little handicapped because they don’t know how to make it.  it will also level the playing field.  many of the people who advanced (reference yale) had parents that were lawyers or had mock trial experience.  that i’m not as much worried about.  the main thing that i thought was disparate was the level of coaching that some people recieved after the first trial and were so much better during the second one.

if you can move the coaching up front i think that people will get much more out of it.  i have a lot yet to work on this.  more to come.
