summary: The [New York Post][1] reports that a charity, after hearing about the horrific
  corporate, imperialistic exploitation of the children paid for the prosthetics. 
  If Warner Brothers does decide to get off their fat asses, walk across their plush
  carpetting on their two good (but fat) legs, pick up the phone with either of their
  good (but plump) hands and place a call to their fat bankers to wire a measly amount
  of throw-away money (likely less than they spent on condiments for the Leo trailer)
  to these children, that the charity will instead give the money for prosthetics
  to 27 other deserving children.

I didn’t include it earlier, but Warner’s alleged response when questioned by the children when their legs were coming was: "You will have to wait for December, when the movie comes out, so we can get some publicity out of it."  Are you fucking kidding me.

I implore you to [email][2] Warner Bros.
