having sufficiently fucked with my rhythms enough to convince myself that it was OK to wake early, i awoke at dawn and decided to stroll.

i was walking around this gigantic lake that was engorged by new deal politics more than the bellies of those beat fuckers who had to dam the damn thing.  

there was a small trail that i was not sure if it was a human trail or a deer trail, and i felt guilty for if it was the latter maybe i was changing many years of animal patterns because they wouldn’t come this way if they could smell early morning human who has not showered for a few days and doesn’t usually smell that good to begin with.  

there was the usual flora around that i had seen numerous times on numerous hikes.  but then i saw a flower that i had not seen before.  

it was something straight out of my doodles.  all straight lines and angles that only an engineer’s mind would appreciate.  there was a back-flower of moderately intense blue and a fore-flower of yellow.  it was like two starfish of two colors and of two sizes were stacked on top of one another with the smaller on top and twisted just a bit.  it was beautiful.  for some reason, and i must have seen these flowers before, it was really engaging.

i wanted to get a closer look at it, but i was leaving no trace and was locked into the pathway.  the pathway got close to the flower so i followed it until it got there.  i looked back at the flower after averting my eyes to get closer.  when i knew i was the closest i would be to the flower i squatted down because i’m indian like that.  but when i finally was closest to the flower i was shading the damn thing.

i became frozen by indecision.  if i never moved the damn thing would wither from lack of sunshine.  if i moved away i would not get to see my flower change and grow.  i did not know what to do so i just moved on.

it was not purposeful.  i did not mean to shade the damn thing.  i just wanted to see it.  it wasn’t my fault that the sun was at an angle such that my closeness shaded it.  but yet that is what happened….aren’t metaphors sometimes perfect?
