Introduction Yesterday a very interesting event happened. And I had the pleasure to listen in. Primavera De Filippi talked Ethereum at a Berkman luncheon.
For those who do not know Berkman is a center at Harvard University. For those who do not know Harvard, welcome to earth. Berkman is officially the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. It is a joint research center housed in Harvard's Law School with the following mission:</description></item><item><title>Iterating over the Traditional - Legal Approaches to Smart Contract Development</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-04-09-notes-from-my-ethereum-talk/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-04-09-notes-from-my-ethereum-talk/</guid><description>Audio Talk is Here Introduction ![slide 1]({{ site.url }}{{ site.root }}{{ site.images_dir }}/{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; }}/ethereum-talk-slides-1.png)
Who am I? My name is Casey Kuhlman and I'm an American lawyer. Currently, I'm running a small law firm with our headquarters in Somalia. In particular, we work mainly in the north of Somalia which is a self-declared independent state of Somaliland. I've been in Somaliland for coming up on six years now and my practice has a wide focus on law building, corporate governance work, compliance work, and corporate transactions.</description></item><item><title>A Proposal for @ethereumproject Provisions, Contracts, and Packages</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-03-06-introducing-ethereum-package-manager/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-03-06-introducing-ethereum-package-manager/</guid><description>Lately on my &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; blog I have been doing a decent amount of writing about virtual automatic contracts. It has been fun to think through the possibilities of virtual automatic contracts and how those could really work in developing countries.
Background and Introduction Earlier this week I had the distinct pleasure of attending the Ethereum meetup in Amsterdam to learn more about how virtual automatic contracts (or as they call them smart contracts) work within the Ethereum blockchain.</description></item><item><title>Linking Virtual Automatic Contracts to IRL Events</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-03-04-irl-links-with-virtual-automatic-contracts/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-03-04-irl-links-with-virtual-automatic-contracts/</guid><description>I have been droning on about virtual automatic contracts for a few posts now.
By the by, today is a bit of an exciting day because later this evening I will be going to the Ethereum meetup in Amsterdam. This will be an interesting opportunity for me to speak with others who are interested in exploring the possibilities of virtual automatic contracts generally and also to see specifically some more details as to how Ethereum smart contracts will work.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Virtual Contracts as Donation Support Mechanism for Humanitarian Crises</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-25-automatic-virtual-contracts-for-humanitarian-relief/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-25-automatic-virtual-contracts-for-humanitarian-relief/</guid><description>Tomorrow I head to Addis Ababa. It has been a decent wee while since I have been to Addis and I am excited to see where the years have taken it. Ethiopia is far &amp;ndash; very far &amp;ndash; from the We are the World days; yet, that image of Ethiopia is stuck in many people's minds &amp;ndash; which is a shame because it is a beautiful, dynamic, and growing country with a lot to offer.</description></item><item><title>Gnome Shell Extensions -- Those Little Bundles of Joy</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-21-gnome-shell-extensions/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-21-gnome-shell-extensions/</guid><description>I have yet to really get into any of the desktop interfaces other than Gnome. I've tried KDE and Unity. I'd like to try Elementary, but probably on an old laptop I'm going to set up for my in laws rather than my primary machine. Since about Gnome Shell 3.2, though, I've done little more than take tours around other desktop interfaces.

Like fish farming and hydroponic vegetable growing for instance (aka aquaponics). I see some increasing levels of synergy between virtual currencies, open data schemes and international development.
Virtual Currencies For those that do not know, virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies are an ecosystem of transmitting value similar in nature to traditional or fiat currencies (dollars, yen, yuan, pounds, euros, etc.) except with added levels of convience and security which you do not get when you want to transmit value by giving someone a piece of paper.</description></item><item><title>How I Use Multiple Workspaces</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-19-using-multiple-workspaces/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-19-using-multiple-workspaces/</guid><description>When I first moved to Linux from Windows in Ubuntu 11.10, I was confused about multiple workspaces. I thought, coming from a Windows background, that they would be overkill and require significant resources from my very old at that time laptop. My laptop then was about a 5 year old Dell that Windows Vista barely worked on. One of the huge reasons I decided to try Linux at all was the way that it was reported to be able to handle older hardware with style and grace.</description></item><item><title>How I Would Structure Automatic Virtual Contracts</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-17-structuring-automatic-virtual-contracts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-17-structuring-automatic-virtual-contracts/</guid><description>Automatic contracts have been occupying a great deal of my free mental energies for the past few weeks since I first learned that there are platforms in the works that will allow for such things to happen. My thoughts on this are quite nascent, as is the technology, but here are my early observations.
Introduction Automatic virtual contracts are, essentially, small computer scripts which are linked to virtual currency wallets. The basic idea is that a financial transaction and the terms and conditions governing the transaction collapse into a singular instrument &amp;ndash; or script.</description></item><item><title>Working with PDFs in Linux</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-13-pdf-extract/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-13-pdf-extract/</guid><description>PDFs are the bane of every lawyer's existence. It is unfortunate that we break free of our addiction to PDFs and this is the thought behind my RMOC project. Until that is a viable option for working with PDFs, here is my suite of free PDF tools that can be used in the stead of the overly engineered Acrobat.

This is a perennial problem. It is always easy to remember those packages you use all the time but what about those packages that you do not but you want them there when you need them. Here is a three step system for ensuring that you never forget to reinstall packages you want when you upgrade your system or reinstall you operating system.

A very intriguing concept frankly. As humans, the (relatively) neutral mechanism which we use to transfer value between humans has almost exclusively been one of the main concepts which has remained solely within the purview of sovereigns. So, what happens when currencies are no longer the purview of sovereigns? Will it work? Will it implode without the sovereignty elephant backing a currency? I have no idea, but I'm fairly optimistic that it will work.</description></item><item><title>Conky -- Smooth Operations</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-05-on-conky/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-05-on-conky/</guid><description>Conky is a tool I have used since about the time I started using Linux. It is a great piece of kit.

My argument to others to use your shell more is simply that you see what is happening with your computer a lot easier than you can with a graphical user interface (GUI). Basically, your shell is somewhat like a glass bottom boat to see what your computer is actually doing. On linux, GUI's often have an option to pull up some of what your computer is doing, but for the most part they do not.</description></item><item><title>Using Dropbox as a Settings Repository</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-01-29-dropbox-as-a-settings-repository/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-01-29-dropbox-as-a-settings-repository/</guid><description>As I said in my previous post, the main way in which I used Dropbox is as a repository for all my settings. Almost the entirety of this will also work with OSX for the record, save for program settings locations in OSX are different than in Linux &amp;ndash; they are usually in ~/Library/Application\ Settings.

Everyone knows it. Even those who know very, very little about computers understand that you should back things up. But no one does. Let's talk quickly about the options which Linux has for backing up your files.
Cloud sync is not terribly new, but it has definitely been mainstreamed within the past year or two. Increasingly, bar associations have been distributing ethics opinions on how lawyers should keep their client's data safe.</description></item><item><title>Why Information is Vital to Making Markets Work</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-01-28-information-makes-markets-work/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-01-28-information-makes-markets-work/</guid><description>![Capitalism by bohman @ flickr]({{ site.url }}{{ site.root }}{{ site.images_dir }}/{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; }}/capitalism.jpg)
It seems to me that there is an increasing push within developed countries against markets as the preeminent organizing force of modernity. This isn't necessarily new; indeed, it is what Marx was against; it is what communism tried to resolve; it is largely the impetus behind the late nineties anti-globalism push; and it is what Occupy was largely all about.</description></item><item><title>The Spectrum of Public to Private Service Delivery</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-01-24-spectrum-service-delivery/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-01-24-spectrum-service-delivery/</guid><description>The people who most interested me were wary of centralized control, but they were not free market libertarians. They believed in the power of competition, but they also believed that some of society's most important achievements could not be incentivized with economic reward. They called themselves entrepreneurs but worked mostly in the public sector. They were equally suspicious of big government and big corporations. From a certain angle, they looked like a digital-age version of such nineteenth-century anarchists as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Mikhail Bakunin.</description></item><item><title>Linux 4 Lawyers -- Encrypting your hard drives</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-01-23-encrypting-your-hard-drives/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-01-23-encrypting-your-hard-drives/</guid><description>I encrypt my hard drives because it is the right thing to do.

Indeed, this has been on my mind for a while and was one of my motivating, longer term reasons for thinking that some kind of text-based legal document format was necessary.
For the production of many documents, lawyers need not worry too much about what goes into repos as it is only the final version of the document which is shared publicly.</description></item><item><title>On Chasing Chaos: The best book about "The Life" I've read in ages.</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2013-10-16-on-chasing-chaos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2013-10-16-on-chasing-chaos/</guid><description>![Chasing Chaos by Jessica Alexander c/o Amazon]({{ site.url }}{{ site.root }}{{ site.images_dir }}/{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; }}/51ln21GGC7L.SY300.jpg)

Of course we all have these icons, these posters, these fleeting images that remind ourselves of where we came from and are readily recalled by our frontal cortex when asked to explain ourselves. When we trust the person and we know that the question is meant because the other conversant(s) truly does want to understand us, then we are more easily able to open up and to tell the truth.</description></item><item><title>What&amp;#8217;s this about attacking pirates on land?</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2012-03-26-whats-this-about-attacking-pirates-on-land/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Mar 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2012-03-26-whats-this-about-attacking-pirates-on-land/</guid><description>So there was some chatter Friday on my Twitter feed about how EU NAVFOR (the EU’s Naval Forces) would be authorized to attack on land. For example:
New EUNAVFOR guidelines allow attacking #pirate targets on late, while #NATO task force stays maritime. #somalia
— Jay Bahadur (@PuntlandPirates) March 23, 2012
My thoughts were quickly to escalation. Escalation is important not only for reasons that anyone who feels attacked or invaded would be willing to increase the violence to protect their stuff, but also because Somalis feel incredibly threatened right now.</description></item><item><title>Book Inscription</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2012-02-03-book-inscription/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2012-02-03-book-inscription/</guid><description>Here’s to the embarkation on a great journey.

This is the second installment in a series which is parsing through Somaliland’s journey towards recognition. The first post in the series, the introduction is available here. One of the legal criteria for statehood is established borders. There is a serious and very well, although often, hidden question as to where Somaliland’s borders are. In this post I try to parse this a bit mainly from the perspective of international law, but also from the political perspective as well.</description></item><item><title>What Does it Mean to be Independent: Somaliland&amp;#8217;s Recognition Journey</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2011-07-20-somalilands-recognition-journey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2011-07-20-somalilands-recognition-journey/</guid><description>After having been in Somaliland, one of the world’s most advanced unrecognized countries, for well over three years I have thought much about what it means to be a state, to have your independence, to maintain your sovereignty and many related issues.

I read an interesting article yesterday from a man who I referenced in my previous post as one of my favorite development bloggers: Owen Barder. Owen has joined a DC based development think-tank called Center for Global Development and in his [good-bye to Ethiopia post][2] he had an interesting thing to say about aid. He claims, and I heartily support, that development is much broader than simply aid, it is about trade policy, climate policy, monetary policy (which he didn’t actually mention), and numerous other policies which the developed world implements and in the globalized economy has massive effects in the developing world.</description></item><item><title>For Business or for Pleasure: Which is Aid?</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2011-04-18-for-business-or-for-pleasure-which-is-aid/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2011-04-18-for-business-or-for-pleasure-which-is-aid/</guid><description>This week two interesting articles (to me) have been published and they have given me the push to return to commenting.

For the longest while, I’ve been obsessed with time management &amp;amp; efficiency. In college my good friend Dave, who was running the orientation program for our ROTC that year, asked me to give a class on time management. It was one of the most enjoyable topics I’ve ever lectured on. We were incoming seniors and we were talking to incoming freshmen. At the time I was listening to lots of Zig Zigler.</description></item><item><title>On Going Local: Finding Your Happy Place</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2010-10-12-local-finding-happy-place/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2010-10-12-local-finding-happy-place/</guid><description>On Going Local is a new (short) series that I’ll be running which will attempt to look at my life from an objective perspective as I transition from and NGO worker into an entrepreneur here in the developing world.

Today Somaliland is holding its Presidential elections. To understand the significance of this event, one must understand the road that it has taken the Somalilanders to get to this point. This election has been delayed for over two years. This entry contains a small background on that time.
The Presidential elections were originally scheduled for August, 2008. In April 2008, the Council of Elders – Somaliland’s upper house of Parliament (the Guurti) – extended the term of the President until April 6, 2009.</description></item><item><title>Decoding the Somali Mind: A Guide for Expats (Anecdotal, Not Definitive Version): Introduction</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2010-06-21-decoding-somali-mind-guide-expats-anecdotal-definitive-version/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2010-06-21-decoding-somali-mind-guide-expats-anecdotal-definitive-version/</guid><description>This is a new series containing a few stories which have stood out in my time here in Somaliland and have helped me to understand a bit more a culture that in many ways is very different from my own, but in many ways is now.

Isle de Goree has, at various times, been a defensive position protecting the bay where the port of Dakaar is and/or a slave exporting island. Most times the slave traders would take slaves to islands off the coast of West Africa and then barter with the transportation people there on the island.</description></item><item><title>Wow.</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-04-21-wow-3/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Apr 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-04-21-wow-3/</guid><description>Senegal = Wow. There isn’t much else to say. ~ # ~

this weekend was pretty amazingly long. in a good way i guess. except for i had a lot of work that could have been done, but i never got around to it. it is mitigated by the fact that none of it was actually due this weekend, i just wanted to get started on it. that can happen later i guess.

Freetown is an amazing place and I am incredibly happy to be here.</description></item><item><title>A love letter to my music collection</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-01-16-a-love-letter-to-my-music-collection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-01-16-a-love-letter-to-my-music-collection/</guid><description>dear music collection:

cameron was down, again, this weekend, for the night and was telling me a funny story. he want to his public library up there in jackson (wy) to see a fiddler who seems to be a performance poet of some kind. apparently the guy is from alaska and he tells stories, plays irish jigs on his fiddle and weaves wilderness poetry in the cracks.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-03-06-261/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Mar 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-03-06-261/</guid><description>it is saturday night and i’m typing and enjoying wine and then going to sit down with my book for the rest of the evening. damn i’m boring!
last night i had a quasi-date with the guat_princess. (as a side note i have decided the best thing about blogging is that i get to give real people fake names and pretend that i’m in sex in the city). i’ll ruin it for all of you: the act banished any interest that i had.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-03-04-262/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-03-04-262/</guid><description>i think that in the past i’ve been very patronizing towards hot chocolate and have made a conscious decision to rethink my position on the substance. maybe it should be legalized afterall. what do you think? ~ # ~</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-03-03-263/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-03-03-263/</guid><description>i am quite tired and sore this evening. not sure what i’m sore from, probably life beating me about my head and neck relentlessly without me really giving a damn and just taking it lick by fucking lick. and i’m not talking about the tongue against ice cream cone kind either.

so it seems to me that i may be reading too much into the HST death. it seems that no one cares. am i the only one? and i dont’ even really care, what I do care about is the social phenomenon the pop counter-culter icon itself. i actually don’t really give a damn that some old man put a .</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-02-23-265/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-02-23-265/</guid><description>Now, I must do this justice, and to do that I need to back up. First, some background. His name is Hunter S.

first there was the major conflict, and that one was internal. i left 29 palms about 10 days ago thinking that i would have resolution on the aspen job quickly. either she would offer me the job or she would tell me to pack sand.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-11-08-270/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-11-08-270/</guid><description>five days later i make my next entry. this time it is from the boulder public library where i’ve been camped out for a bit and pretending i’m back in college and doing something productive with my time. i think that i’ve found where i want to live. boulder has the quadfecta as i’ve deemed it of: climbing, kayaking, ski, community. those are the four things that i’ve looking for in places to live.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-11-02-271/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-11-02-271/</guid><description>well i’m reading all these things about how the vote has begun. so, in a sign of things to come: i have lost a toe nail. and it isn’t one of the small ones, it is the big one on my left foot. on a hike about four weeks ago i stubbed it terribly bad while i was running down the insanely steep hill and trying to avoid both the rocks and the cacti.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-10-31-272/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-10-31-272/</guid><description>decisions decisions decisions. i guess that i have made my bed and now i’ll revel in it. i put in the applications at aspen and heard back from the chica there yesterday. she seemed anxious to interview me, i’m sure i can talk my way into the job. i was already planning to leave on friday to get there for vail’s job fair on saturday. now i suspect that i’ll leave here as soon as i close the loops on two different things.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-10-24-273/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-10-24-273/</guid><description>i think that something interesting to study would be the history of companionship. at what points in history have people really desired true companionship and partnership out of their significant others? the victorians and all that flowery poetry shit that they wrote were supposed to be significant steps in the history of love. however, i wonder if it was love like we would call it. whenever i read any of elizabeth barrett browning or any of her contemporaries it seems that it is only infatuation.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-10-08-274/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-10-08-274/</guid><description>tonight’s thematique du jour is loneliness for two reasons. firstly because i think that i’m essentially a completely lonely person, even when surrounded by people. secondly, and more presently, because i watched parts (most) of about schmidt. that movie is basically a film students study in the emotion. at least that is my take on the piece.

not a fucking thing! i worked the entire weekend and when i wasn’t arguing over sentence structure or the connotations of one word versus another and the stylistic derivations of this character’s &amp;ldquo;written pattern of speech&amp;rdquo; versus anothers or some other idiotic equivalent i was curled on my corner of jack’s comfy couch staring blankly at some television that was either a movie or sports or the food network.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-09-30-276/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-09-30-276/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;chasing amy&amp;rdquo; is on tonite. i’m watching my past. i’m amused by the scene where they throw darts. i also like jason lee’s character, it’s one of the internally truest characters in movie-dom.
why do people always lie when answering the question: how are you?
news of the day: jimmy swaggart told some people that if a guy ever looked at him weird he’d kill them. reminds me of when i was drunk in LA soon after the war and i told these chick’s i’d &amp;ldquo;fucking kill them.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-09-26-277/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2004-09-26-277/</guid><description>just back from the getty for the afternoon. went down the hill to my friend’s house for the first night. actually was one of my ex’s. she’s fairly intense, and likes it that way so she plays it up. we drank wine on her porch while i sweated in my jeans and too long of sleeve shirt because its been cold up here and my dumb ass was relishing the cold enough that i dressed for it when i shouldn’t have.</description></item></channel></rss>
