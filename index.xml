&lt;p>It is now a trope to say that we live in unprecedented times. Perhaps we should stop and think about that. It's now universally understood &amp;ndash; at the human species level &amp;ndash; that what is happening around us, to us, through us, and is ahead of us has never &amp;ndash; in all our human existence &amp;ndash; happened.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And, so, I feel drawn to write more. Again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Currently, I run &lt;a href="https://monax.io">a startup called Monax&lt;/a>. At Monax, we build a system that helps companies to better create, track, and manage their legal contracts. This is something that I've long felt was a glaring hole in the technical capabilities offered to businesses. As I often say on sales or fundraising calls, I've had a windy road through life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before I ran Monax, I ran a law firm in Somalia. To the insiders here, it was Somaliland &amp;ndash; a self-declared republic that broke away from Somalia. Despite the urgent appeals by Somalilanders, it is still, technically, Somalia. I started that law firm with some partners after running a governance reform project there. Before that I was in law school and before law school I was an infantry officer in the Marine Corps. And before that I did a degree in structural engineering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along my path I've been fascinated as to how large, complex systems operate. And this blog has always been my chance to think about and share those observations. If you would like to see the entries from long ago they are available under the &lt;code>Muniments&lt;/code> tab.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-i-intend-to-speak-about">What do I intend to speak about&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the last five years, I've been telling many around me that it feels like we are living in the 1930's. There has been a subtle pressure point, a feeling ever so fleeting, yet certainly there, that something big and catastrophic was coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There has been a steady crescendo of nationalism arising from the undercurrents to the mainstream. There are fascist elements organizing now in broad daylight across much of the developed world. Governments I previously thought impervious to authoritarianism are now patently leaning in those directions. Developed world countries with resources, experience, and power are increasingly acting in a manner unbefitting of their &amp;ldquo;developed&amp;rdquo; world status.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social and political systems are now in a position where they could potentially leverage a giant upheaval in public health and economic systems. And potentially the full collapse of those latter systems. Because we have purposefully dismantled our safety nets. We have ignored risks. We have devalued resilience. And to what end? If we face systemic collapse of important parts of our world how will we replace these? What lessons will we learn as a species from this trying period we face?&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">As we unpack this dual pronged crisis over the coming decade(s) one thing I really truly hope we learn is tightening down the tolerances in the way we conduct business and continuing to devalue resiliency will be shown be a major contributing factor to what made a bad situ worse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/8H411QsUci">https://t.co/8H411QsUci&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Casey Kuhlman (@compleatang) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/compleatang/status/1242954902541930499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 25, 2020&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>

Here's the video.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQqZ9b0S0BY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video">&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>For those of you not involved with the, all in all, rather small cryptocurrency community the people in that video are some of the bigger names within the community. The village elders if you will. Not sure the village actually chose them, but elders tend to be self appointed anyway &amp;ndash; at least at first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend and business partner, Preston, provided his response in &lt;a href="http://prestonbyrne.com/2014/08/14/tory-2/">this fine article&lt;/a>. I take an analogous, but distinct, view from Preston's.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="anarchists-go-experience-anarchy-or-shut-up">Anarchists: Go Experience Anarchy, Or Shut Up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the overarching points of the video is that Bitcoin is somehow sovereign, which I assume means a system unto itself. And I'm not simply picking out one word from many and obsessing about it. That is the entire point of a &amp;ldquo;Declaration of Independence&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; for a group to declare that it is no longer beholden to a prior sovereign and is now beholden to a different sovereign.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But who is the sovereign in which these individuals of common purpose are beholden to? Who knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm a relative outsider to this whole cryptocurrency thing. Sure, I'm trying to &lt;a href="https://erisindustries.com">build a business&lt;/a> which will utilize some of the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies. However, I am by no means a believer that a few cryptographic hashes and a fancy database somehow changes any of the real human dynamics which scientists, artists, philosophers, and the like have been pondering for a couple millennia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As an outsider, it is (anthropologically) interesting to watch a bunch of (predominantly) white (predominantly) Americans (and Canadians) purport to claim that an interesting payment protocol will solve world peace, governmental overreach, and all the other ills of modernity. The idea that somehow because there are cryptographic hashes and p2p communications protocol that those will suddenly shift the paradigm of modernity and that we can reach a point where governments are unnecessary is&amp;hellip; I'm not sure what it is actually.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've lived in anarchy. I know what it looks like when governance systems collapse. I have felt how easy elite capture becomes in such situations. I have tasted hyper inflation. I challenge anyone who identifies as an anarchist to actually go to Somalia &amp;ndash; or another area where governance systems have collapsed for a significant amount of time. Spend some time there. Talk to people about their lives. Understand what the hell you're talking about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whatever the participants&amp;rsquo; individual motives are I cannot speak to, I suspect that many would identify more with libertarian thinking than pure anarchical thinking. For those that do have anarchical tendencies, please see above. For those that have libertarian thinking, please see below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lesson-1-declaring-independence-is-an-emotional-exercise-building-a-system-is-a-rational-exercise">Lesson 1: Declaring Independence is an Emotional Exercise; Building a System is a Rational Exercise&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In 1991 the elites of the Somalilanders &amp;ldquo;freedom&amp;rdquo; movement (it wasn't about freedom really, it was about capturing the state in the name of the Somalilanders) were forced by a bunch of emotional people to declare their independence from Somalia. Many at the time, and many today, question whether this heated, emotional, reaction was the correct decision. Nonetheless, it happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As most Democracy and Governance, Conflict Studies, and Crisis Situation scholars and practitioners understand declaring independence is the easy bit. Pretty words on paper (or in a video) don't mean anything in reality. They are simply those &amp;ndash; pretty words. They can inspire, sure, but beyond that they mean little.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the case of Somaliland it took about 13 years after the Declaration of Independence to have a really functional Constitution and the state building is still going on &amp;ndash; and likely will be for another two generations. It took a massively important leader with a real commitment to building a functional system who fought tooth and nail to build a constitution which was both responsive to constituent concerns while also setting the framework for a functional system. It took scholars, and discussion, and compromise, and &lt;em>work&lt;/em> to get there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The question I have for those who participated in this video is this: are you actually interested in doing the work necessary to craft a system? Only time will tell.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lesson-2-if-you-want-to-sit-at-the-adults-table-act-like-adults">Lesson 2: If You Want to Sit At The Adults&amp;rsquo; Table Act Like Adults&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>During my time in Somaliland I said the above more times than I could count. Mostly in response to idiotic stuff whatever Minister or other person of purported power who was sitting in some vaunted chair did. It would drive me crazy that Somalilanders in positions of power would drone on about how they were a &amp;ldquo;real state&amp;rdquo; but how they continued to fail to perform the most basic of governance functions. You can't have it both ways I would tell my friends. Either you need to do the work, make the sacrifices, and be your own state, or else you just need to shut up. More times than I currently care to count, I would watch the Somaliland government act as a rebel organization acts and then go on BBC Somali asking why the world wasn't treating them like a state. Most of the time the reason the &amp;ldquo;world&amp;rdquo; wasn't treating them like a state was because they weren't acting as a state acts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I view the cryptocommunity through a similar lens. It talks &amp;ndash; &lt;strong>at nauseum&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; about how it &lt;em>deserves&lt;/em> to be taken seriously. Really? Why? What has it done to &lt;em>deserve&lt;/em> being taken seriously? Certainly there is some very interesting technology that has been built. And that technology should be taken seriously. As technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Bitcoiners, and the cryptocommunity more generally, should not somehow be free from the normal rules which apply. If those inside the cryptocommunity want cryptocurrencies to be treated &lt;em>as&lt;/em> currency, then they must abide by the &lt;em>normal&lt;/em> rules which attend to handling money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These rules &lt;em>are&lt;/em> onerous, precisely because businesses which deal with folks&amp;rsquo; money are, well, dealing with folks&amp;rsquo; money. I do not understand why cryptocurrencies businesses should somehow get a bye as to providing proper safeguards, as has been agreed in the relevant states are necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lesson-3-real-systems-empower-professionals-and-root-out-scammers">Lesson 3: Real Systems Empower Professionals and Root Out Scammers&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When I was in Hargeisa some of the more interesting people I hung out with were folks who were trying to set up a governmental quality assurance system. There were a lot of problems that needed to be tackled, but foremost on the minds of these scientists (some of who had been trained locally some of whom had been trained abroad) was the difficulty of ensuring that medicines were proper. There was (and likely still is) a huge problem of knock-off drugs, mislabeled drugs, and the like. These scientists were trying to tackle this. Because it was putting the health of community members in jeopardy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoyed my time with these scientists and doers precisely because they saw a collective problem and were trying to do something about it &amp;ndash; despite the odds. The odds being that big importers who supported big actors within the government make more money off fake drugs than real ones. The odds being that quality assurance of medicines is not one of aid's current hot topics (and therefore there was no aid money to support their activities). The odds being that of all the problems in Hargeisa this was not the one that was on the tip of folks&amp;rsquo; minds &amp;ndash; except for when those folks had sick kids. Despite those odds, these guys were trying to do something to protect folks. And that was awesome from my perspective. They are a &lt;strong>long&lt;/strong> way from solving this issue, but they are trying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the cryptocommunity doing about rooting out scammers? There are, indeed, some efforts. And I hope that they continue, because the cryptocommunity has a huge scammers problem that needs to be addressed in a fundamental way. It isn't likely to happen with a technological solution; it is much more likely to happen via legal or social mechanisms. But so far we've only seen a few of these take place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Time will tell how this all plays out. Indeed, most of this is about the community more generally than a response to the specifics of that video. I think there is some very interesting technology which bitcoin has brought to people's attention. It would be a shame if that technology was overshadowed by people projecting their issues and complaints with bigger systemic issues on it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday a &lt;a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2014/04/difilippi">very interesting event&lt;/a> happened. And I had the pleasure to listen in. &lt;a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/pdefilippi">Primavera De Filippi&lt;/a> talked &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org">Ethereum&lt;/a> at a Berkman luncheon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those who do not know Berkman is a center at Harvard University. For those who do not know Harvard, welcome to earth. Berkman is officially the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. It is a joint research center housed in Harvard's Law School with the following mission:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Berkman Center's mission is to explore and understand cyberspace; to study its development, dynamics, norms, and standards; and to assess the need or lack thereof for laws and sanctions. We are a research center, premised on the observation that what we seek to learn is not already recorded. Our method is to build out into cyberspace, record data as we go, self-study, and share. Our mode is entrepreneurial nonprofit.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For more, see &lt;a href="https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/about">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Primavera's talk had a lovely title, &lt;code>Ethereum: Freenet or Skynet?&lt;/code> and it really was a bit of an exploration of the ideas underlying this topic. Primavera first popped up on my radar on the Ethereum Skype group a couple of weeks ago, and I have read &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/03/decentralized-applications-built-bitcoin-great-except-whos-responsible-outcomes/">some&lt;/a> of &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/01/its-time-to-take-mesh-networks-seriously-and-not-just-for-the-reasons-you-think/">her work&lt;/a> on Wired, which I would highly recommend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Her talk involved a quite fair introduction to Ethereum and what the community is trying to build. What was most interesting about listening to the live audio stream of the event was the questions which were asked by the Professors, researchers, and whomever else was in the room. The video of the talk is online and I would definitely encourage anyone within the Ethereum community to take a listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For those who are not familiar with it, Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain network (similar in nature, but distinct from, Bitcoin). Ethereum is touted as a mechanism which allows developers|lawyers to develop and deploy smart contracts which operate autonomously. Officially, there is the Ethereum boilerplate:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ethereum is a platform and a programming language that makes it possible for any developer to build and publish next-generation distributed applications. Ether, Ethereum's internal currency, powers its applications and acts as a &amp;lsquo;token of exchange&amp;rsquo; on the decentralized network. Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company governance, contracts and agreements of most kind, intellectual property, and even smart property thanks to hardware integration.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I had specific reactions to three of the veins of questioning which were raised during the question section of the discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="enforcement-or-administration">Enforcement or Administration?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A great proportion of the questions had to due with enforcement. And most of these questions sort of miss the point. This is exactly why I recommended at my previous talk that the Ethereum community does a slight pivot from the self-enforcing contracts verbiage to self-administering contracts. Enforcement is a term which gets lawyers all aflutter &amp;ndash; and rightly so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ethereum could never really be self-enforcing until its blockchain becomes ubiquitous. Perhaps then it could be actually self-enforcing, but until such a time the limitations of the Ethereum blockchain mean that there is not actually much that Ethereum could do outside the context of the blockchain. Indeed, to a lawyer, enforcement connotes outside intervention in a private transaction. While Ethereum could build such things as Judges as a Service (JaaS&amp;hellip;? A term, perhaps coined by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mids106">Joris Bontje&lt;/a>) which would have outside determinative impact of a smart contract, those systems would not actually do the enforcing. They would predominantly do the interpretation. JaaS &lt;em>will indeed&lt;/em> have a dramatic impact on such an ecosystem, but the main roles which such services would play would be to interpret whether real world events met the metrics established in the proof of work, proof of effort, or proof of XYZ that are contained within the smart contract's algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, we are a way from this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This pedantic difference between the term &amp;ldquo;enforcement&amp;rdquo; and the term &amp;ldquo;administration&amp;rdquo; to lawyers is mostly why I prefer the latter to the former. Indeed, it is not only the isolation of the Ethereum blockchain which leads me to prefer the former term, but also it is the very nature of Ethereum. Ethereum contracts pay for computing cycles. Well, technically, the users of the contracts pay, but that nuance is still being worked out. What this means is that there is an incentive to build very small, single-use contracts and then to link those contracts together so that a user only pays for the computing cycles the user need in order to determine some outcome. Why is this even relevant? Because Ethereum will really shine as a business intelligence layer within a value stack of large organizations. It is less interesting to me whether an Ethereum contract and actually move money around than it is for Ethereum systems of contracts to be able to calculate the movement of value within the system based on a complex set of inputs, calculations, and outputs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think, for example, of a community based recycling system (which I'm working on a client with to outline how this could work on Ethereum). In such a system, recycled goods would be collected from individual households by individual contractors, brought to a community based &amp;ldquo;collection center&amp;rdquo; where they are resold back into the value chain. All of the individuals involved (whether as contractors who pick up the goods or individuals who give their goods or marketers of the system) have a certain cost to the ecosystem and bring certain benefits. The overall revenue which such a system receives should then be distributed within the ecosystem based on a calculation of the overall cost to the system of individual participants and overall benefit which individual participants bring to the system. Try calculating that in Excel or Sage! But Ethereum smart contracts could do that. If they had knowledge of the overall revenue stream they could perform a complex series of calculations where individual contracts have inputs, actions, and outputs and because these contracts can talk to one another they can &amp;ldquo;act&amp;rdquo; such that everyone within the ecosystem can have transparency for where all of the value is going.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key in the above scenario is not exactly moving the money around, it is in producing a ledger and profit-loss sheet for the system. Whether money is performed by a human or a payroll system with an API hook to the accountant contract is largely immaterial to understanding the real &lt;em>value&lt;/em> that self-administering contracts can bring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above presents what I think is a very interesting possibilities and when we talk about Ethereum as being self-enforcing it gets lots of people off on a tangent about pulling computers out of smart cars so they cannot talk to the blockchain rather than thinking through what value the blockchain system could bring. By talking about self-administering contracts we can &amp;ndash; to a certain degree &amp;ndash; avoid this tangent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-relationship-to-the-state">The Relationship to the State&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a long, tough question to answer. And no one will likely get it right for the foreseeable future. How do we strike the right balance between public rights of &lt;em>all&lt;/em> and the private rights of &lt;em>me&lt;/em>? Who knows. We humans have been struggling with that question since we started thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other major portion of the questions were focused on the relationship that the Ethereum ecosystem may have to states. One of the most interesting veins of discussion was about whether blockchain technology would be more or less efficient than the state at enforcing contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an important question which I have been considering at length over the course of the most recent weeks. One of the sub-veins of discussion had to do with the links between smart contracts and court enforcement. I was asked this a lot after my last talk at the most recent &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Ethereum-Meetup/">Amsterdam Ethereum Meetup&lt;/a>. For the time being, I am recommending to clients that if they want &amp;lsquo;real world&amp;rsquo; enforcement for the time being that they should build a normal contract and add the Ethereum contract as an addendum to that normal contract. This would force the court to either enforce &amp;ndash; or ignore &amp;ndash; such a contract but it would have the benefit of having some real world enforcement if such was essential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a design, admittedly, would not really address the question of efficiency of administration of contracts (by which I mean determining whether specific metrics within a contract have been met in the real world rather than actually taking a house away from someone because someone has determined that it was sold). One of the important points which I wish would have been raised by the law professors is that most contracts that go to court, go to court because there is a question about the meaning of some terms. Contracts which are clear but only need to determine if some event happened or not predominantly settle or are arbitrated. Contracts that go to a court are &amp;ndash; for the most part &amp;ndash; those that are not clearly worded. Ethereum is drastically more efficient that the state with regard to this particular metric. Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Contracts as code mean that contracts cannot be ambiguous as to their meaning. Certainly there can be differences of opinion as to whether a particular metric was satisfied in the real world (What does it mean if I promise to give my best efforts to achieve a certain outcome &amp;ndash; such clauses are popular in employment contracts?). Certainly there could be bugs. Certainly slight differences in code structure can lead to drastically different outcomes (Does shipping you a good to the wrong address mean &amp;ldquo;I shipped it&amp;rdquo;? Yes. Does it mean &amp;ldquo;I shipped it to you&amp;rdquo;? No.). But what contracts as code cannot be is ambiguous. We will always know &amp;ndash; determinatively &amp;ndash; what the outcomes will be (as long as we know what the inputs are). After all it is just code. This addresses what I suspect are a large proportion of contractual disputes that end up on court.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As to the overall efficiency of the state enforcing contracts, I'm skeptical. One of the questioners raised land property rolls. The argument basically boiled down to &amp;ndash; we have built these systems; therefore they are more efficient. That may be true and this particular moment but it avoids the more interesting question, which is whether in the long run the current systems used by the state to &lt;em>track&lt;/em> property rights (and to be honest this is, ultimately the state's roll unless someone comes to them and tells them that their property rights are being violated &amp;ndash; in which case the state will send its police to a house and kick out the squatters). The State is not going anywhere, and I &amp;ndash; for one &amp;ndash; am not anarchic. The State can bring value to blockchain ecosystems without ending up at a authoritarian dystopia because the State is simply a collection of humans and we humans live in a tension between the devils and angels that sit on all of our shoulders. But setting up blockchain technology in opposition to state systems is wrongheaded. Why couldn't the State use a blockchain system to track property in the short or medium term. It could keep the human (police) element of the enforcement, but blockchain technologies are very powerful, decentralized systems which are cheaper, faster, and more resilient than what the state could actually build (because central points of failure will always be central points of effort for attackers).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="freenet-or-skynet">Freenet or Skynet?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Overall, I think Primavera did a quite good job at exploring the possibilities on both sides of this false choice. Indeed, these are not the only two choices and as with most things in live, the likely result will be somewhere between the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We humans are constantly in a struggle between competing ideas, visions, histories, and norms. The very nature of this competition (which underlies our philosophies of democracy, markets, the scientific process, and free speech rights, among many other things) keeps us somewhere in between a utopic and dystopic future. Not to mention the impetus for nearly all of all our greatest art. The tension between these ideals is likely to always exist as long as we humans exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While both of the extremes are interesting on an analytical and strategic level to discuss, discussion of these two ends of a spectrum presents discussants with a false choice. The reality of the development of any system is rarely either of the extremes and usually ends up somewhere betwixt the tween. Ethereum, as with most technology, is a value neutral proposition. It is just code. It can be used for good ends or foul ends, but the code is the code. Like the HoneyBadger, it doesn't give a fuck.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What Ethereum will allow us to do, and some of the participants and Primavera herself did a good job of exploring, is to explore different normative bases for ideas. How would contracts work if we wanted to code forgiveness? Mercy? I have no idea, but these ideas are worth exploring. As I said in my most recent talk, the possibility of exploring, studying, and utilizing different normative bases for transactions could be exceedingly powerful for us as humans. This is why I'm spending time contributing in my own small way to the Ethereum ecosystem. The possibilities are there, it is up to the humans to figure out what we will do with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="who-am-i">Who am I?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My name is Casey Kuhlman and I'm an American lawyer. Currently, I'm running a small law firm with our headquarters in Somalia. In particular, we work mainly in the north of Somalia which is a self-declared independent state of Somaliland. I've been in Somaliland for coming up on six years now and my practice has a wide focus on law building, corporate governance work, compliance work, and corporate transactions. For the past few years I have spent most of my time building, reviewing, negotiating, and amending contracts for clients which range from international organizations to international NGOs to international companies all the way down to individuals. I live in Somaliland for some of the year and I live here in Holland for some of the year because my wife is also a lawyer and she works down at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. At this point, part of our business is continuing in the Somali region and another portion of our business is starting to work with clients in the blockchain sector to develop systems of contracts and the like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I first became interested in blockchain technology last summer when the main money transmitter company in the Somali region faced a threat that their bank account in the UK with Barclays was going to be closed due to compliance concerns within Barclays. If that company would have closed its operations, that would have drastically affected our business. We have an incorporated entity in the US which allows us to receive wire transfers to our US bank account and then we transmit those to our headquarters in Somaliland via this money transfer company so that we can pay our operating expenses. That concern led me to some of the thought documents about the (currently latent) power of blockchain technology to reduce remittance expenses. Over time, it was probably inevitable that when Ethereum started percolating through the community that I would become interested.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-this-talk-about">What is this talk about?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>What I'm here to talk about today is how Ethereum looks from the eyes of one lawyer who works in a place which many would say has an immature rule of law. I would not necessarily say that, but it has been said by others many times that the Somali region is a libertarian's paradise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems to me that it should be a testament to the power of the Ethereum idea at how much community involvement there has been in this idea. That is utterly fantastic. However, within any community there must be a balance of different perspectives. To date, it seems from my persective that we have a great amount of developer interest in Ethereum. Indeed, how many here tonight would identify as developers? And how many would identify as lawyers? And how many would identify as both? That is more or less what I expected after reviewing the RSVP list on the meetup site. So this talk is meant to somewhat balance the perspectives and provide one lawyer's perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-barebones-of-it-all">The BareBones of It All.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>One of the things which I like best about living in a developing country is that it strips away most of the superficial layers in the systems which run our modern world. I have had the chance to learn about environmental interference with microwave transmission of internet data because when our internet goes down I want to know why. I have learned about supply line resiliency when I buy a gas cooker but the ship bringing a year's supply of gas sinks in the harbor because it hasn't been dredged in however many years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these systems which we take for granted in more developed countries, systems which just work, we do not often have a reason to learn about them. But in developing countries when there is a shock to a system which that system is not resilient to, then you have to learn about the system when you have to cook with deforesting charcoal instead of efficient gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same thing has applied to my law practice. I am forced in my daily practice to strip back all of the superficial layers of the legal systems which I originally learned about and dig into the mechanics of the system to find what works and what does not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in this talk, I have tried to distill out three rules which I always think through (maybe not always consciously) when I am building, reviewing, or negotiating contracts. Along the way I'm hoping to be able to point out why I am very excited for the future of blockchain technology, and especially the smart contracts ecosystem which the Ethereum community is building.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rule-1-use-your-funnels">Rule 1: Use Your Funnels&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Developers understand stacks, so let us start with a stack in the software engineering sense of that word. In a stack you have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>software that moves around memory references and does other fundamental things very close to a processor's core;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>software higher up in the stack that makes information so that it can be added, modified, and changed;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and software higher up in the stack still that makes things look pretty.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Developers work on different portions of the stack at different times in order to accomplish different things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In law we also have a stack, but I think it is better to think in terms of a funnel than a stack. In a legal funnel you have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>things which prohibit certain actions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>things which compel certain actions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If we were to plot these &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; as a measure of the AMOUNT of actions they can PROHIBIT or COMPEL against the SPECIFICITY of those actions then we would build a graph that looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we think about building a contract we have to internally build this funnel for ourselves. Part of this funnel, the part I call the COMPLIANCE FUNNEL is out of our control as the parties to an individual contract. Those things are required by living or operating in a certain geographical jurisdiction and|or by operating in a particular sector. The rest of this funnel, the part I call the CONTRACTING FUNNEL is in our control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The proportion of the entire funnel which is a compliance funnel and which is a contracting funnel will differ based on time, geography, and subject matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-funnels-help">Why Funnels Help?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>These funnels help us build contracts because they allow us to write fewer words. Think through in your favorite programming language the first time that someone coded a web server for that language. Unless it is an ultramodern language which had web services in a 0.0.1 release, it is likely that the first time a webserver was built in the language that it contained a huge amount of code. And the second time it was built it was able to use some functionality from some sort of a standard library. And the third time it was built it was able to use some functionality from a low level, third-party library built on top of the standard library. And eventually we have a situation where frameworks, low level, and standard libraries all work together so that I can say:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">require &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;sinatra&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
require &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;haml&amp;#39;&lt;/span>
get &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#39;/&amp;#39;&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">do&lt;/span>
haml &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">:index&lt;/span>
&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">end&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>For those that do not know, this is a very simple web application using Ruby's Sinatra framework. Underneath these five lines of code are an entire framework of code, from Sinatra, from other third party libraries, and from Ruby's Standard Library that allow me to have a web application in five lines of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funnels are like that. They allow us lawyers to develop contracts with less &amp;ldquo;code&amp;rdquo; than if we needed to code the entire stack. The first person who &amp;ldquo;coded&amp;rdquo; an employment contract had to build out tons of if|then statements into the contract. Over time, as employment laws and commercial norms develop those two areas can reduce the length and complexity of any individual contract because that individual contract is able to rely upon the standards from the law and commercial norms just as a Sinatra application relies on the stack developed by the framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-is-this-important-for-ethereum">Why is This Important for Ethereum?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first thing I want to point out is that while many lawyers and clients tend to want to &amp;ldquo;avoid&amp;rdquo; laws, they do provide a valid function &amp;ndash; just as frameworks do in the coding world. This function simplifies the nature of specific contract building greatly. Ethereum gives us a chance to re-envision our commercial relationship with &amp;ldquo;the law&amp;rdquo;. In a way which is not currently possible in the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second thing I want to point out is that Ethereum gives us an opportunity to develop, test, and perfect different ideas of how contracts and relationships (which I'm going to talk a bit more about in a minute) should work. If I want to develop a dynamic web application I have a vast array of choices. Do I want to do it in: Node, Ruby, Python, PHP, .Net? Do I want to do it in Express, Sinatra, Twisted, Wordpress, Drupal, or some other framework? All of these choices are there and available for me to use. They all have their proclivities, predilictions, advantages, and disadvantages. I choose which is best for me, program on top of it and try to use its advantages while minimizing its disadvantages. I see Ethereum playing out in a similar way where different legal ideas, norms, and contractual structures are held either off the blockchain in open source repositories or on the blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third thing I want to point out is that in order for Ethereum to be able to leverage frameworks, contracts on the blockchain will need to be able to operate together in a fundamental way while contracts residing off the blockchain in open source repositories can have their own way of interacting with each other. So when we think through what should be on the blockchain or off the blockchain in repositories it is important to think through this. It is like the difference between referencing a Google hosted jQuery library where I only need to specify a particular version and using a node library which I will need to connect to an API and perhaps another point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rule-2-keep-contracts-social">Rule 2: Keep Contracts Social&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At their core contracts are a set of rules that provide for an interaction between different entities with divergent goals, capabilities, and resources. Building contracts, as with coding, is both an art and a science. The science part of contracting is largely making sure that for this particular instance that the funnel is properly aligned and the contract is built so that the funnel is workable. The social side of contracting is predominantly where the art comes into play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I said, I work in Somalia and Somaliland much of the time. There we have a predominance of oral agreements. I am not a fan of oral agreements, but I have come to respect their cost effective nature. The reason that I have a problem with oral agreements is that they suffer from a memory bias and are not precise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Written contracts, on the other hand are a way to balance precision against many other concerns which exist within complex social systems. Written contracts give us an ability to have both precision and individuality in the face of complexity. This is a powerful idea when you think about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the challenges for contract developers in the traditional contract development space is how do we work through the interests and incentives of the parties to craft a contract which is designed to succeed while also providing our clients with appropriate safeguards in cases where it does not succeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most contracts, most of the time, are not breached. And those that are breached are often breached in a way which does not require a court to enforce. It is only a minuscule amount of contracts which have to go to court in order to be enforced.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Well, I suspect that for most people most of the time, that when they agree to do something they will follow through on that or will be prepared to face the consequences for not following through on that promise. We are social creatures and it makes sense in a social construct that our promises will be vital for our future ability to conduct whatever activities we want to conduct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of our nature inclination to think that we will follow through on our promises, we tend to not even want to have specific breach clauses in our contracts. In my own practice, when I ask people why they have gone into a multimillion dollar business with only an oral agreement this is what I'm often told. That trust is so vital to the daily workings of the business and demanding or requesting a written contract at the beginning would start the venture off on the wrong foot. My clients who work in the more developed world understand that trust is all well and good but it is also good to work through the process of building a written contract for the venture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This topic is one area in which I may differ from many in who are also into blockchain technology because I feel that trust between individual humans is something to be lauded not to be avoided. While I understand fully the reasoning behind the trust-less movement, I think that organizations work best when there are trust-less backstops in combination with trust between individual actors within the organization. I agree with those who advocate for less trust within the system that having tension within the system is good because it forces the system to be adapted to diverse parties. However, I feel that tension within the system can easily become friction within the system if the contract is not properly designed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my opinion, this is one of the most difficult areas which the Ethereum community will need to work out. My main concerns with respect to keeping contracts social if they live on the blockchain are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Verifying offer and acceptance should be integral to the process. As I understand it right now, contracts seem to be deployable to the blockchain based on only one party. That is a unilateral agreement, which is fine, but it is something that we should look at carefully because unilateral agreements have difficulties. Unilateral agreements can work, but they do not work as well as contracts which are bilateral or multilateral agreements between entities &amp;ndash; each of which maintaining its own position. Certainly Ethereum contracts can be designed as multilateral contracts, but the default setting of Ethereum contracts &amp;ndash; at this point &amp;ndash; is essentially unilateral. If the blockchain defaulted to multisignature deployment and allowed single signatory deployment of contracts to the blockchain, I would be much more comfortable than the current situation. From a legal point of view this will be difficult in the real world which mostly requires affirmative showing of both an offer and acceptance in order to have a valid contract. In the real world we do this by drafting, reviewing, and signing contracts. But, the contracts that I've seen on Ethereum are not currently designed in this way. In my opinion this is an area which should be a core part of the protocol rather than left to contract designers because it is utterly fundamental.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other side of the coin, Ethereum will allow us as a community to design different interactivity points which can provide a trust-less base but also develop trust by the community involved in the contract. For example, the concepts of DAO's are likely, if properly conceived and structured, to really build real trust within a community. The automatic administration of contracts which can redistribute value within a network are a way to build trust within the humans in the network because of the automatic way in which smart contracts will work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most exciting aspects of Ethereum is that the nature of how contracts are administered (which I prefer over the more difficult word enforce) is most advantageous when there is a simple transfer of value. Since contracts can only live on the blockchain and talk to other contracts on the blockchain and/or transmit value within entities on the blockchain, this constrains how contract designers think through incentives and outcomes. I'm hopeful that by constraining how contracts are administered and by opening up the funnels, that a variety of new incentive structures with different outcomes can be crafted. This could allow for a great expansion of innovation within contracting which is relatively stagnate and where innovation amounts to using word A instead of word B rather than fundamentally looking at incentives, outcomes, and parties to realign interactions between entities in different and interesting ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rule-3-define-the-decision-space">Rule 3: Define the Decision Space&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This rule is often overlooked by professional contract lawyers, and I think that is to their detriment. This applies to all contracts, but it is more interesting to think about in the terms of multilateral contracts &amp;ndash; in particular organizational governance contracts. What do I mean by decision spaces? I tend to think of organizations in terms of ven diagrams of duties. Each individual node within the organization has particular duties which are unique to that individual node and also most nodes will have duties which are shared with other nodes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In traditional contracting these decision spaces are used to define what, for example, a board does vis a vis what the managers do vis a vis what the shareholders do. It works with many other types of contracts as well and I almost always keep this in mind when I'm reviewing or drafting any type of contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the area among these three topics where I think that Ethereum will be the most transformative. At this point the decision space concept is not very well defined where it likely should be, for example in employment or consulting contracts. Mostly these contracts have an overview of the decision space allocation between the parties which lacks specifics. In traditional contracts this is needed so that the lawyers to not have to do an amendment to the contract. But in Ethereum changes to decision spaces will likely be nominal. Because contracts can be linked together you can have events &amp;ndash; such as a new department built, or a new hire for a new position, or a change in by laws &amp;ndash; which will be events that can &amp;ldquo;bubble up through the DOM&amp;rdquo; of the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In conclusion, I just wanted to say that although many lawyers get a bad name and that many people have had bad experiences with lawyers that not all of us are jerks. Some lawyers, indeed, are jerks, but Internet Explorer 6 was a jerk of a program. This is important because those of us lawyers who have been doing contracts for a while should be participating in the development of the Ethereum ecosystem by bringing to the table the lessons that we've learned along the way. This has been my entry into that lexicon by laying out three rules which I always try to keep in mind when I'm working with any contract: use your funnels, keep contracts social, and define the decision space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

It has been fun to think through the possibilities of virtual automatic contracts and how those could really work in developing countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="background-and-introduction">Background and Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Earlier this week I had the distinct pleasure of attending the &lt;a href="https://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum&lt;/a> meetup in Amsterdam to learn more about how virtual automatic contracts (or as they call them smart contracts) work within the Ethereum blockchain. For those that may not know, Ethereum is a derivative of Bitcoin but focused on being a platform for virtual automatic contracts. Although loosely based on Bitcoin's blockchain technology, it is meant as an expansion of that technology into a larger system. Here is how Ethereum describes itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ethereum is a platform and a programming language that makes it possible for any developer to build and publish next-generation decentralized applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything: voting, domain names, financial exchanges, crowdfunding, company governance, contracts and agreements of most kind, intellectual property, and even smart property thanks to hardware integration.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The idea is to build a scripting language and combine that with the &amp;ldquo;permanence&amp;rdquo; of blockchain technology and allow &amp;ldquo;contracts&amp;rdquo; within the sandboxed blockchain to take decisions (based on their code) and to interact with other contracts (again based on their code). This combination of a scripting language and blockchain technology opens up an amazing range of possibilities. For now, this technology is very much pre-alpha stage, but there is a LOT of momentum behind it and getting 25 people or so at a meetup in Amsterdam shows they are doing a fabulous amount of PR work to spread the word about what they are doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the meetup there was a lot of talk about lawyer|coders (or coder|lawyers, not sure which). As I'm pretty sure 99% of the room were mainly coders or financial tech people, the concept of a coder|lawyer was mentioned almost with a laugh in the room (or at least with a sly smile). Well, we are out there. The advantage which coder|lawyers have over either coders or lawyers is that we understand to a large extent how contracts work in the real world but also understanding what computers can do. This gives us a special place within the virtual automatic contracts world. If you are a lawyer and a hacker I would encourage you to read the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-White-Paper">Ethereum Whitepaper&lt;/a> and think about participating.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-an-ethereum-package-manager">Why an Ethereum Package Manager&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In any open source ecosystem a range of products to hack on the system needs to be developed. A method of testing applications (or contracts in the Ethereum system) needs to be developed. A method of simulating applications || contracts needs to be developed. A method of compiling applications || contracts needs to be developed. An easy method of deploying applications || contracts needs to be developed. There is a whole range of infrastructure systems which need to be in place for the system to really function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most vital aspects of the ecosystem's infrastructure is some sort of a package manager that will assist in pulling packages from other sources and doing other things to assist in the development and deployment of packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nearly every open source ecosystem I know of has various package managers that automate a lot of different aspects of the ecosystem (depending on what the ecosystem needs, etc.). Ruby has Rubygems and Bundler. Node has NPM. Python has Pip. ZSH has antigen. OSX has Homebrew. VIM has Vundle. Sublime has Sublime Package Manager. You get the idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have started coding out an Ethereum Package Manager &amp;ndash; &lt;a href="https://github.com/watershedlegal/epm">EPM&lt;/a> &amp;ndash; because I think it will very soon be necessary if anyone is going to build anything more than a simple, isolated contract. One of the things that struck me during the Ethereum meetup this week was that there is going to be a lot of boilerplate redundancy within contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, at the beginning of nearly every contract will be a check to ensure that the contract has enough currency to pay the network for running itself. The way that Ethereum is structured is that contracts need to pay the network for two different things: (1) they pay for the amount of storage they are using, (2) they pay for the number of computing cycles they use. Storage is paid for when the contract deploys onto the network (or when it changes its storage allocation as I understand it). But computing cycles are paid for as they are used. Contracts can hold their own value in credits which are then paid to the network (or other sources depending on the contract's code) on each computing cycle. This means that a contract, if it is running low on funds, does not want to be in a position of executing part of its code and then running low on credit. This will leave the contract in a weird state and generally F up your system. The only part that lawyer|coders need to understand is to build in a small IF statement check at the beginning of the contract to make sure that it does not run unless the contract has enough credits to run the entire script. This is some of the boilerplate that will be required for the Ethereum virtual automatic contracts and nearly every single contract will have this boilerplate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another example will be the self-amendment terms of the contract. Note how I used the lawyer word &amp;ldquo;terms&amp;rdquo; there but one could equally use the coder term &amp;ldquo;settings&amp;rdquo; as I'm referring to the same thing. On a technical level, Ethereum contracts are able to modify their own code. This is equal parts wonderful and utterly terrifying (although the utterly terrifying concern is probably deferred until our contracts get better by an exponential amount). Until we need to worry about sentient bots that can send war drones to kill those that we don't like using the Ethereum blockchain and its IRL connections, we simply need to be worried about the terms under which the contract can amend itself. At times we will want to restrict the contract so that it cannot amend itself full stop. At times we will want to restrict the contract so that only amendments sent via a particular Ethereum address (be that either some master contract &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; this contract on a hierarchy tree or a human with an Ethereum address) will be actionable. At times we will want to restrict the contract so that only amendments sent via a particular set of Ethereum addresses (usually this would be after some sort of a voting mechanism was executed by those other set of Ethereum nodes) will be actionable. There may be other iterations but it is likely that these are the three main iterations. Again, this is boilerplate and should be written into any contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lawyers work with boilerplate via Word templates. &lt;a href="https://github.com/rmoc/rmoc.github.io/blob/master/about/index.md">Don't get me&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown">started on Word&lt;/a>. Coders work with boilerplate via packages or generators. If Ethereum is going to be easy for lawyer|coders to utilize, then we will need some sort of a system which allows us to work with boilerplate. I'm hoping that EPM will be at least one way to do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="three-functions-of-ethereum-package-manager">Three Functions of Ethereum Package Manager&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I've tentatively structured the Ethereum Package Manager to conduct primarily three functions. First, Ethereum Package Manager will serve as an easy way to pull, push, and upgrade your boilerplate. Second, Ethereum Package Manager will simplify your contract development sequence by simplifying the commands to lint, test, simulate, compile, and deploy your contracts. Third, Ethereum Package Manager will provide an (opt out) mechanism for users to support the Ethereum infrastructure with tips. In this sense, EPM is a bit larger than some other package managers in scope.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="package-management-functions">Package Management Functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>EPM will allow you to pull, push, and upgrade boilerplate. This will be necessary so that boilerplate provisions can be structured in such a way that the community can achieve consensus on best practices. Also it will simplify the deployment of standardized contracts to the Ethereum blockchain. For example, if a lawyer|coder was tasked with building a decentralized autonomous guild and it needed to pull bounty contracts for some aspects of the guild's operations, then EPM could be used to pull those contracts which best suit the system the lawyer was trying to build. These could be kept in proprietary git repositories or on Github (obviously with a preference for the latter) and pulled into the system in the amounts and with the constants as needed for eventual deployment of the organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="package-development-functions">Package Development Functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>EPM will provide a simplified way to work with your contracts. After EPM is used to pull in standardized provisions &amp;amp;&amp;amp; || standardized contracts. Then the lawyer|coder will want to edit, lint, test, simulate, and compile those contracts (or system of contracts) before deploying them to the Ethereum blockchain. EPM in combination with other systems will simplify this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-support-functions">Infrastructure Support Functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The last primary function EPM will provide is a mechanism to support those developing EPM, testing suites, simulators (which are really REPLs I guess), compilers, etc. While it is always great to give to a community, it is even better to be able to do what you love and pay the bills. This is always the difficulty with open source systems and a modest tip mechanism is, I hope, not overly controversial. How it will work is that within the configuration files, EPM will place the addresses of the infrastructure tools it knows you are using along with an equalized percentage of tip across those tools. These can be changed globally or per project and can also be taken out completely if the lawyer|coder cannot afford to send tips or does not agree with the system (hey, I never pay Kiva every time I make a new loan because I'm a freeloader like that.) In the configuration file will be three lines: the address to send the tip to, the percentage of the deployment tip, and the (optional) message to send with the tip. Then when the contract is deployed, the deployer will tell EPM the total amount of tip to be sent to the infrastructure system. EPM will then distribute this based upon the configuration files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="status-of-epm">Status of EPM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is simply an idea at this point. The TODO includes everything. I am hoping to have some amount of this functionality deployed by the end of next week. In any event, Ethereum is not yet launched and is only working off the testnet so there is still some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ethereum-packages">Ethereum Packages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order for EPM to be most beneficial to the community, the community should agree on certain conventions as to how packages, contracts, and individual contract provisions will be structured. These are my thoughts on the matter, and I welcome all input and thoughts on the matter. For now, I would recommend that EPM be fairly stupid and simply pull in lines of boilerplate, mash those together than then let the human work out any problems that the assembled mass creates. Later, it will be good to have some standardization within the contract provision system so that EPM can be smarter about how it pulls in and combines provisions. It will take a while for the Ethereum ecosystem to reach that point, so for now the conventions I'm proposing below would be fairly rudimentary in nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ethereum-contract-files-xxxxethereum-contract">Ethereum Contract Files: XXXX.ethereum-contract&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ethereum contract files should be written in a single language which one of the compilers can parse. There should not be portions of the contract file written in one of the compiler languages and another portion written in another of the compiler languages. Ethereum contract files should be fully composed contracts which can be compiled and deployed with minimal user interaction (perhaps adding some addresses or constants to the script before compilation and deployment). Ethereum contract files should reside in a git repository (for now).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ethereum-provision-files-xxxxxethereum-provision">Ethereum Provision Files: XXXXX.ethereum-provision&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Ethereum provision files should be written in a single compiler language, and should reside in a git repository, but need not be fully complete contracts. Indeed, most provisions should not be complete contracts and instead should only provide a single unit of functionality to the contract. EPM will be built so that it can pull various XXXX.ethereum-provision files from various git repos and assemble those into a guess at what the final, assembled contract will look like. For example, if one lawyer|coder writes the definitive contract amount check provision (see above) and puts that on Github then others can instantly pull that provision into the contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Alternatively, I've thought about breaking prefaces and postfaces and substantive provisions out into their own files so that the package manager will know that prefaces go before the substantive provisions and postfaces go after the substantive provisions. However, after reflection it seems that such a system would be more restrictive than what is laid out above and at this point it would be more beneficial to have the system remain neutral as to where lawyer|coders place certain provisions within their contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The general idea with ethereum-provision files would be to allow people to pull in different types of provisions into a cohesive contract to be edited, tested, and deployed quickly and simply. As the ecosystem develops, I would hope that this will allow the quickest deployment of contracts onto the system for users (predominantly for lawyer|coders who are more the former than the latter).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ethereum-package-manager-configuration">Ethereum Package Manager Configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>EPM will work based on configuration files and contract definition files. There are two configuration files that any instance of EPM will work with. Residing in &lt;code>~/.epm/config.toml&lt;/code> will be the global configuration file. It will be in TOML format. A local configuration file will also be used only in the context of the current working directory. This is how many package managers operate and it will allow the user to set global defaults as well as per project configuration. The details for the EPM configuration are in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/watershedlegal/epm">README&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, in order to define contracts, in the project root will live various XXXXXX.ethereum-definition files (not sure that name will stick and other ideas would be welcome). These will be simple text files and will tell EPM where the contract provisions (or contract) resides that it will pull in and build. Within the contract definition file (which would be somewhat analogous to a Gemfile or your .zshrc or .vimrc file if you were using antigen or vundle) a user will be able to note an entire repository (in which case EPM will pull in all the files in that repository), a single file within a repository, or even a range of lines from a single file within a repository. Since EPM will know where the repository is and since repositories are version controlled, this will allow EPM to update the boilerplate down the road in case certain best practices change, security flaws within contracts are determined, or simply because things have changed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Feel free to add any comments, questions, or feedback below, or, better, drop an issue on &lt;a href="https://github.com/watershedlegal/epm/issues">Github&lt;/a>. As I said above, I'll be working on this over the coming week and hope to have something moderately useful within a week or two.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have been droning on about virtual automatic contracts &lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/on-virtual-currencies.html">for&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/structuring-automatic-virtual-contracts.html">a&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/the-latent-natural-synergies-between-cryptocurrencies-opendata-development.html">few&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/automatic-virtual-contracts-for-humanitarian-relief.html">posts&lt;/a> now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the by, today is a bit of an exciting day because later this evening I will be going to the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Amsterdam-Ethereum-Meetup/">Ethereum meetup in Amsterdam&lt;/a>. This will be an interesting opportunity for me to speak with others who are interested in exploring the possibilities of virtual automatic contracts generally and also to see specifically some more details as to how Ethereum smart contracts will work. I am particularly interested in how to test and deploy contracts onto the network. For the most part the Ethereum scripting language appears to be relatively straight-forward, but the key thing I'm currently lacking before I really dig deep and start coding out provisions and contract structure templates is how the contracts get from my text editor where I draft what I think they should be to a test environment to make sure they are not throwing any errors I did not want and then into the actual Ethereum network. Understanding how that test and deploy will work is crucial else you will not be able to get your contracts to work within the system. This piece is not necessarily about Ethereum, in the vein of my previous pieces this is more generalized in nature and should apply to other smart contract protocols that are coming online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If virtual automatic contracts are going to be even moderately interesting beyond simple financial derivatives of other virtual currencies or products then paradigmatic linkages to real world events must be developed. I have been thinking about this for a while because if &lt;a href="http://watershedlegal.com">Watershed&lt;/a> wants to be able to support the development of DAOs and other smart contract mechanisms &amp;ndash; which is where we are attempting to go over the course of the year &amp;ndash; then the real key to development of any contract which will have more than an academic interest is how to link to the real world. So far, I have come up with three paradigms that I think would to a certain degree work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="irl-paradigm-linkage-1---data">IRL Paradigm Linkage 1 - Data&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I stated in my previous post on open data and development, data which is aggregated by an agency or organization which the parties agrees is neutral and has no incentive to skew the data in either direction could be agreed to by the parties as a provider of machine consumable IRL data which smart contracts can use to make &amp;ldquo;decisions&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;spend&amp;rdquo; its money appropriately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will steal an example of how this could work from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ethereumcharles">Charles Hoskinson&lt;/a> (who for the record is quite eloquent at explaining what Ethereum is up to). Let's say you wanted to develop a crop insurance mechanism. Let's say that you found there was a single causal link between crop returns and rainfall and that for the most part you were not interested in (for whatever reason) insuring against vector or pest crop failure or any other failure. You were only going to insure crops against a lack of rainfall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You sell a product whereby at the beginning of the season farmers send via mobile money a certain amount of money (which would be a factor of how much land they were insuring). When the farmer sends the money, from a legal point of view this would constitute the contract offer. This insurance policy would then be verified by some agent that you have in the field to insure, for example, that the farmer actually has the land and has cultivated the crop. After field verification then your firm would respond with an SMS to the farmer that you have accepted his offer of the contract and that the contract is deployed. Once the contract is deployed the humans get out of the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the course of the term of the contract, the smart contract would be given permission to speak to a national weather service data feed that aggregates rainfall data in the farmer's area (and presumably other areas as well). Upon the expiry of the contract term (which would likely be structured to be around harvest time), the smart contract would pay out in an inverse relationship to the amount of rain which actually fell and would rely upon the government's national weather service for it to &lt;em>know&lt;/em> what that amount of rainfall was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other real world questions which could be used by virtual automatic contracts by linking to data feeds would include some of the following: did you ship the item(s) &amp;ndash; verified by a UPS feed? Did you build the web site &amp;ndash; verified by a Travis or Jenkins build result? These would be more specific in nature than general data feeds such as weather data but for the most part they could be used in certain situations. For example, where the contracting party that was seeking to outsource some specific portion of a web application or coding project to a contractor built tests for that and wrote the contract such that the coder was paid automatically upon the Travis or Jenkins build passing the specs &amp;ndash; that would work. However, this would not always work. For example, if the contracting party did not have the time or ability to write the specs and was looking to outsource the build of the specs along with the build of the feature then it is unlikely that building a Travis or Jenkins build feed into the virtual automatic contract would be wise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data can be a powerful tool for understanding &lt;em>some&lt;/em> real world events. Primarily data feeds should be used where you need high level, aggregated information which applies generally to a specific group of people (based on age, class, location, profession, etc.) but not to specific people. Also data feeds as IRL linkages for virtual automatic contracts will be important where you also want to tap into a specific type of event but not to specific events. The basic idea of when you would want to build a virtual automatic contract to link to data feeds is when you want to zoom out from the specifics of the people, parties, and events that the contract may interact with. Data obviously won't work if you need to &amp;ldquo;zoom in&amp;rdquo; or if you cannot get at the data (like the amount of potholes that currently exist in Hargeisa&amp;hellip;we are making great strides at getting at data but we still have a long way to go and even in big countries there are still zillions of data feeds which are not fully developed and leverage-able.).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="irl-paradigm-linkage-2---referees">IRL Paradigm Linkage 2 - Referees&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you do not have a data feed to rely upon, or when you need to look at the deeper specifics of people or events, then you will need some human involvement in the smart contract. I am hesitating to call these judges or arbitrators because I think the role of these humans would be slightly different in the sense that what this post is about is figuring out whether a real world event occurred or did not occur. It is a bit pedantic to say I don't like the term judges or arbitrators here, but I think that what we are looking at here is different in form and function. Really what we want the referees to look at is providing a binary answer to a relatively simple question which computers cannot answer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The questions which a referee could be used would include some of the following. Did you make the web application to the correct style specification? Did the product you shipped meet the quality specifications built into the contract? These things could not easily be determined using data feeds. Did you actually plant the crops in the field that you have sought to insure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are three main considerations which I would recommend drafters build into virtual automatic contracts when utilizing referees to verify IRL events. First, the question which the referee needs to answer should be binary in nature. Second, the question which the referee needs to answer should be verifiable in nature. Third, the question which the referee needs to answer should be objective and party neutral. Let's take a look at each of these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the question should be binary. Did event Z occur? Yes or no. Sometimes this is tricky to determine and will require specialists to answer (such as does this drug meet the stated chemical specifications or does this widget meet the design specifications from this CAD drawing); sometimes, however, the question will not require specialists to answer. Whether specialists need to be involved or not will depend on the subject matter of the contract. Either way, the question which the referees need to answer should be structured so that it is binary in nature. So the contract should be structured such that the answer is yes or no, not a list or an essay which will be difficult for a computer to parse. Additionally if the question can be structured in a binary way, then experts from any language base could easily be utilized to answer the question (for the most part) and so you would have the entire world upon which to draw referees from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the question should be verifiable. Why trust one referee with determining whether an event has occurred when you could trust 3 out of 5 or 51 out of 100 or whatever threshold the parties agreed upon. If the questions could be structured in a way which the task could be uploaded to a microtasking platform such as &lt;a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon's Mechanical Turk&lt;/a> then you could easily have the questions be verified by multiple referees to ensure that one referee does not either have a bias or simply made a mistake and pressed Yes when they meant No. This would require structuring the terms of the contract in a specific way. For example, to verify that crops were planted, one could require a geotagged photo from a smart phone uploaded to the insurers site. The site could use computers to match the geotag on the photo with property records with the application for the insurance. As long as the geolocation data from those three match (within some allocable error range) then go to the next step of verifying that crops were planted. The photo which has verified its location data could then be sent to the microtasking platform with the question: Were crops planted in this field? If 3 of 5 respondents say that crops were planted there then the insurer would accept the offer from the insuree and the insurance contract would be deployed. It is up to the drafter to work with the parties to build the questions in such a way that they can be verified by multiple referees which will reduce the uncertainty and also the claims of bias by the referees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, the question should be objective. I see a lot of contracts; mostly I review contracts developed by other parties since for the most part my clients either have global templates or are Somali businesses who are given proposed contracts by larger entities. One of the things that always strikes me about many contracts is how much subjectivity is in contracts. This is fine for some types of contracts (see below) but when it &lt;em>is&lt;/em> possible to reformulate a specific verification to be objective and party neutral that would be advantageous. When I say party neutral I mean to say that whenever possible the parties should not be mentioned and the question which is sent to the referees should be focused on IRL events. So rather than ask the question like, Did party A do X? it would be advantageous to ask the question like, Did Z occur? There could be a difference in X event and Z event from the above two questions, but this will be one of the tricks in very good virtual automatic contracts and not so good virtual automatic contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="irl-paradigm-linkage-3---trust--subjective-verification">IRL Paradigm Linkage 3 - Trust || Subjective Verification&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the overarching factors of the cryptocurrency space is to explicitly disallow trust. However, for many contracts trust is unavoidable. Trust and subjective verification are substantially the same thing. When I order something online I am entering a contract which has trust and subjective verification at its core. I pay the online merchant trusting that they will ship me the item and the online merchant trusts that I will not send it back to me for a stupid reason. We both subjectively verify that the two primary events have occurred (payment, and sending of the proper item).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Subjective verification and trust have one significant advantage over the above to non-trust related IRL linkages: they are efficient. It will be easy, but for the foreseeable future not an extremely simple engineering feat, to link data feeds with smart contracts or referee networks. However, it will always be easier to build a subjective verification into a contract. Yet, this will require the parties to trust one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the cryptocurrency community tends to not &amp;ldquo;like&amp;rdquo; trust so much, as a lawyer there appear to be some advantages to building subjectivity and trust into a contract. In particular, there are advantages when the parties are entering into a long term contract and where the parties &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to be able to trust one another. For example, I would likely build employment contracts for high level individuals with a trust and subjective verification clauses for some portion of the contract and then objective data feeds for other parts of the contract. In these types of contracts the parties want to be able to trust one another. The Board wants to be able to trust its officers and the officers want to be able to trust the Board. The tricky part will be determining what the conditions are which would allow the contract to trigger different clauses that are more objective in nature or would allow for a termination of the contract (which is a subject for a different post I'm working on). Obviously these triggers would be very different depending on the type of virtual automatic contract which the lawyer|coder was building, but it is likely that if you want to have a functional virtual automatic contract with some efficient elements of subjectivity within the contract that you build some triggers which one or both of the parties can utilize to turn to a more objective mechanism for determining whether an event occurred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, it will not be simple to link real world events to virtual automatic contracts, but these three mechanisms would provide the basis on which to build. What am I leaving out? Are there other paradigms that you find that could work?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tomorrow I head to Addis Ababa. It has been a decent wee while since I have been to Addis and I am excited to see where the years have taken it. Ethiopia is far &amp;ndash; very far &amp;ndash; from the We are the World days; yet, that image of Ethiopia is stuck in many people's minds &amp;ndash; which is a shame because it is a beautiful, dynamic, and growing country with a lot to offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The singularity of image which Ethiopia maintains in some people's minds got me thinking about what role virtual currencies and automatic contracts could play in responding to a humanitarian crisis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the record, I'm not a humanitarian worker. I'm a development worker. They are linked but not exactly the same albeit there is a pretty fine line betwixt the tween. Development workers stay in a country for longer periods and work on more systemic issues. Humanitarian workers largely respond to crises and in theory should stay in country for shorter periods of time and work on matters of more immediacy (get the schools open, make sure safe drinking water is available). Theoretically at least, the line is somewhere in the top 60% of Maslow's needs. If you work under that threshold you are likely a humanitarian worker, and if you work above that threshold you are likely a development worker.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="damage-assessment">Damage Assessment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first thing which humanitarians must do is to assess the damage that has been caused. It is elementary that in order to address a problem you need to know what the problem is. Damage assessment is the humanitarian version of this. I have been a long time reader of Patrick Meier and his fascinating blog &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/">iRevolution&lt;/a>. Patrick has been working with OCHA and other UN agencies (along with many others I suspect) to form a &lt;a href="http://digitalhumanitarians.com/">Digital Humanitarian Network&lt;/a> which performs microtasking and categorizing of damages so that higher agencies can have a more bi (business intelligence) view of the situation. For background on this I would suggest &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/11/11/humanitarian-technology-haiti-to-yolanda/">here on early work in Haiti and for Typhoon Yolanda&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/11/13/early-results-micromappers-yolanda/">here for an updated SitRep from Yolanda&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/2013/11/25/combining-radio-sms-computing/">here for some thoughts on integrating SMS and machine learning&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="http://irevolution.net/2014/02/17/crowd-computing-uav-imagery/">here on the role of crowd computing to analyze drone pictures&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The basic idea that Patrick and others in his tribe are working with is that the natural instinct of people to help in times of crisis should not be restricted to geography and by using advanced computing, digital imaging, and microtasking, the gigantic task of performing a damage assessment can be freed from geography, performed faster (in near real time), output more evenly damage assessments than a single human being with her|his biases would output.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="response">Response&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After a damage assessment occurs, then the onus usually falls to implementing agencies (such as Save the Children, UNICEF, Oxfam and others) to move assets into place that will provide the necessary relief. These agencies, for all their flaws, are really, really good at this. They may not be as fast as those affected by a crisis would like them to be, but all things considered they are really quite fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine the sequence of events after a major disaster. The big agency puts out a call for donations. Those donations flow in via small SMS's. Those small SMS's need to be aggregated; transfered to a large bank account in a developed country; then they need to be audited to ensure that no money came from known terrorists or money launderers; then the money needs to be transfered to a large bank account in a developing country and|or used to purchase supplies, pay staff that are deploying, provide cash for staff currently affected by the crisis themselves, etc.; then and only then can the big agency begin to distribute the money to smaller agencies in other parts of the region affected by the crisis via bank transfer; then those small agencies need to purchase supplies, pay staff that are deploying, provide cash for staff currently affected by the crisis themselves, etc.; then and only then can the small agency actually provide some help to people. This tail is long. And each step in the line takes time. One or two days for each of those steps seems reasonable. Indeed, a week seems reasonable, especially for a large wire transfer to a developing country (which can be the norm). But when you aggregate these steps you end up with a week or two or eight between when the SMSs come in to the large agency and when that agency can actually do something with the money.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-positive-roles-could-virtual-currencies-and-automatic-contracts-play">What Positive Roles Could Virtual Currencies and Automatic Contracts Play&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although the discussion above is simplistic, it is more or less how I (as a semi-outsider) understand that things work. There are a few ways in which virtual automatic contracts could be leveraged to speed up the response time of the ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing that jumps out to me is a way to provide some incentive to the MicroTakers. This &lt;em>may&lt;/em> be controversial in that perhaps they feel they are donating their time and do not expect to gain any value from the exercise, but perhaps that is not necessarily the case. Humanitarian work is a profession which requires professionals in order to do it right and those professionals do not expect to work for free their entire lives just because they &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To assist in the professionalism of the digital humanitarian microtaskers it would be trivial for an engineer to build a contract where X% of the donation stream which came in via virtual currencies was automatically reserved for the microtasker pool and then was distributed among those microtaskers according to various metrics such as the difficulty of the &amp;ldquo;block&amp;rdquo; they were &amp;ldquo;mining&amp;rdquo; (categorizing different data streams would presumably require different levels of precision and ability) or the &amp;ldquo;amount&amp;rdquo; they &amp;ldquo;mined&amp;rdquo; (the more someone contributes to the system the more they should be rewarded). In this system, the greater the overall donation pool, presumably somewhat linked to the level of the disaster and the amount of people affected and the amount of people interested in assisting those, the higher the per task reward for the digital humanitarians who are working on damage assessment from their cell phones on trains in stable parts of the world or however they are doing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system would likely take one engineer less than a week to build into the current microtasking platform that DHN already has running. Perhaps a bit longer but the investment to build this into the platform would likely be minimal vis a vis the overall cost to engineer the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A similar type of system could be build for newer, automated, machine learning portions of the damage assessment which would not require human interaction. This would be farther out, but the theory would likely be that those donating their computing power to the effort would then be rewarded for that donation somehow. This is exactly how BitCoin mining currently works, except the computing power would not be focused on securing the network (all that bitcoin miners are actually doing) but rather on performing the damage assessment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second way, and perhaps more interesting way, in which virtual automatic contracts could be used to speed up service and good delivery to affected populations is to use automatic contracts to dispense money and then let those affected spend that money in their local markets on local goods and services to a greater extent than currently happens in many developing countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's quickly compare how disaster relief works in a developed country to a developing country. When a disaster occurs in the US for example, there are big rewards for local markets to respond to that disaster (viz. Treme, and growing up in Florida). So when a disaster occurs it actually entrenches local and regional markets rather than displaces them. Ask any power worker in the South when they've been able to buy a new car and they will likely tell you that it was due to working their ass off following Hurricane Z. In developing countries however, we have a tendency to think that local markets are simply non-functional. This may or may not be true, but very often the way that humanitarian response works displaces local markets to a very large extent (for more on this read my friend &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chasing-Chaos-Decade-Out-Humanitarian/dp/0770436919">Jessica's book&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are very interesting trends in this space right now which are working on the displacement of local markets. For example, in the most recent flareup of drought in Somalia where I work there was a decentralized, diaspora led effort to send cash via money transfer and mobile money operators directly to the affected population who then used the money to purchase goods and services from local markets thereby entrenching those markets rather than displacing them. How it largely worked was small-ish organizations gathered donations in a central hub and then changed these donations into a mobile money format and dispensed it via a mobile money automater. It was wonderful to see it happen, although I'm not sure what the results of it were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The theory of virtual automatic contracts would be that they could be used &amp;ndash; especially in combination with mobile money &amp;ndash; to speed up the whole process and to increase resiliency throughout the system. If the big agencies who collect donations then had in place virtual automatic contracts with smaller agencies who in turn had virtual automatic contracts with the beneficiaries in their region, then we would be talking hours from the moment a disaster struck, to the moment that resources were in the phone of the affected populations. This would ebb and flow over time based on damage assessments which would then trigger movements of the inward resources flow to certain areas which the humans and|or robots said were of greatest need (however that was defined). Donation streams would also ebb and flow over time, but at the peak (presumably after the damage assessment system was fully deployed and operating) donations could be in people's phones within minutes of coming into the main donation wallet. Think about that. Minutes from my phone in country X to the phone of an affected person in country Y.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Auditing is extremely important for these agencies as they receive significant funding from public resources and those public agencies tend to care about such things as terrorism and money laundering. However this would be trivial if this all happened on a blockchain. All a donor would need to do is to go to &lt;a href="https://blockchain.info/">blockchain.info&lt;/a> or some other similar site to see their donation and how it flowed from their phone or computer to the big agency, to the small agency, to the beneficiary. That would work when we reach a point of adoption of virtual currency where the beneficiaries could pay for goods and services with their virtual currency. There is likely an intermediate step where either the big or the small agency would need to wholesale trade the virtual currency for mobile currency which would then be dispense to beneficiaries. The difficulty there in the medium term is that the blockchain of a virtual currency allows the donors to see with granular clarity where their money went and mobile money would not necessarily be able to do that. Of course the distributing agency could open their books, but it would not happen automatically and transparently as it does on a blockchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-role-would-virtual-automatic-contracts-play">What Role would Virtual Automatic Contracts Play&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the above sequence there are two primary things that negotiating virtual automatic contracts would play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, they would play the role of operating as a way for large organizations to pre-vet smaller organizations. Ideally these would take place during the normal course of business rather than when an emergency hits. By completing a contract between the big organization and small organization, the big organization will have an opportunity to perform due diligence on the small organization and to gather its virtual currency addresses, etc. so that the pipe between the large and small organizations is built and vetted so that any compliance requirements that either organization have are fulfilled. Once the pipe is built then what comes through the pipe or does not is as simple as routing currency inflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, and probably more interesting, these contracts provide an opportunity for the ecosystem within a country or region to conduct a negotiation as to what actually matters during a humanitarian crisis. In other words, how will the damage assessments be ranked and what will be the distribution of donation inflows among the various competing priorities during a humanitarian crisis. Today these are often negotiated on the fly by individual human beings (or worse, committees). But, if this negotiation happens &lt;em>before&lt;/em> the crisis then calmer, more utilitarian minds can establish priorities that will then be hard coded into the contracts and the robots would then make the distribution rather than the humans with all of their biases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those are my thoughts. What are your's?&lt;/p>

I've tried KDE and Unity. I'd like to try Elementary, but probably on an old laptop I'm going to set up for my in laws rather than my primary machine. Since about Gnome Shell 3.2, though, I've done little more than take tours around other desktop interfaces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case you did not know, one of the greatest things about Linux is that you can do this. You can explore different desktop interfaces and find the one that works for you. Gnome works for me. It may not work for you. You may prefer another flavor. That's awesome! Because Linux successfully compartmentalizes different aspects of the computer it is &lt;em>nearly&lt;/em> trivial to change desktop interfaces without having to reinstall the entire Operating System. Especially if you are using one of the major distributions to provide the underlying portions of the operating system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-extensions-i-use">The Extensions I Use&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I currently use sixteen extensions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/766/alternative-activities/">Alternate Activities Menu&lt;/a> has a nice workspace indicator. I do not really use one of its killer features which is to semi control the other extensions and to &amp;ldquo;remember&amp;rdquo; which applications are open in which workspaces (the latter because I'm anally retentive enough to always know where things are).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/">AppIndicator Support&lt;/a> is one of my favorite extensions right now. I have used some variety of this extension since shell 3.2, but this is the best in class for my (not) money. This extension does a great job of letting me customize where application indicators (tray icons, whatever they are called today) go &amp;ndash; either in the top panel or in the bottom message tray (the former I see much more often than the latter). This allows me to put things that I don't want to visually clutter my panel into the message tray where I don't really need to see them but every once in a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/768/audio-input-switcher/">Audio Input Switcher&lt;/a> | &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/751/audio-output-switcher/">Audio Output Switcher&lt;/a> are two great little tools that give me a quick way to switch what audio input | output I'm using from the system menu which is always the top right corner of the panel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/16/auto-move-windows/">Automove Windows&lt;/a> I spoke about this in my post on desktops. It does what it says and automatically moves windows to the specified workspace when you open them. It does not lock them into the workspace so you can move them around after they are opened, but it is nice to know that Spotify always opens in the Third Workspace or however you set it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/595/autohide-battery/">Autohide Battery&lt;/a> does what it says and hides the battery icon from the panel when the battery is fully charged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/">Caffeine&lt;/a> this is a great little extension which stops the screensaver and lock screen from being triggered. You can set it up to always turn on upon the occurrence of certain events. For example, I keep chromium on my system and then link Caffeine to always turn on when chromium is open. So if I want to watch videos on my computer I just use chromium rather than chrome which is my daily driver for browsing, and then I do not have to worry about the screensaver turning on. It's the little things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/111/calculator/">Calculator&lt;/a> when you press the Super (Windows) key in Gnome you go to the activities overview. This extension puts a wee little calculator there which you can use. I'm using it less and less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/97/coverflow-alt-tab/">Coverflow Alt-Tab&lt;/a> makes Alt-Tabbing beautiful in Gnome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/545/hide-top-bar/">Hide Top Bar&lt;/a> this is utterly an essential extension for me. I do not like having wasted pixels &lt;em>always&lt;/em> used at the top of my screen. If I want to see the panel I'm happy to scroll my mouse there or hit Super. Otherwise, leave me alone and let me focus on the task at hand. This is another extension which I have used various flavors of since I started using Gnome and I've resisted upgrading shells until I knew that an extension of this variety was working in the next version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/">Media Player Indicator&lt;/a> is another long-standing (for me) and very popular extension. It puts a summary of whatever media is playing (or open but not playing) into your system menu so you can control or see different things. It has always been good eye candy for the panel and in the latest version of Shell it has collapsed into the system menu which brightens that up a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/695/mediakeys-to-mpris2/">MediaKeys to MPRIS2&lt;/a> transmits my function F8 into a next song for Spotify and other apps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/732/message-tray-on-bottom-right-corner/">Message Tray on bottom right corner&lt;/a> over time, Gnome has changed how you get to the message tray. I like being able to fling my mouse at the bottom right corner and having the message tray pop up rather than Super+m. This is a nice to have but not essential extension for me because I care what is going on in the message tray only a couple of times a day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/53/pomodoro/">Pomodoro&lt;/a> timer. Must have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/425/project-hamster-extension/">Project Hamster Extension&lt;/a> how I track my billable and non-billable time fluctuates over time. Have tried many different solutions and I'm here now. Not sure if will stick but have been enjoying it for about a month now. Has a good autocomplete feature and looks a hell of a lot nicer than other applications. Being designed for Gnome specifically makes it appealing as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/">User themes&lt;/a> allow me to have different themes for Gnome Shell to make it look, act, and feel different ways. I used Elegance Colors but there are tons of flavors available. This extension has been a must have since the very first version of Shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-uninstalling-enabling-disabling-extensions">Installing, Uninstalling, Enabling, Disabling Extensions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are in gnome and a user of normal variety, do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You will be much happier thereafter. Tweak tool allows you to turn extensions on or off and also lets you get to the extension preferences and options interface which you will need from time to time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, you can also get to these things from the &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/">gnome extensions web app&lt;/a> which is a brilliant tool. From there you can install, uninstall, enable, disable, and go to the preferences for any extension you have installed. It interacts with your desktop in a way which I really like, but could see how some paranoids would hate &amp;ndash; luckily because Gnome is open source those paranoids can see what information the web app is gathering from your desktop. The interface is simple and a very good way to try out different extensions to see the ones that are good for you!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

Like fish farming and hydroponic vegetable growing for instance (aka aquaponics). I see some increasing levels of synergy between virtual currencies, open data schemes and international development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="virtual-currencies">Virtual Currencies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For those that do not know, virtual currencies or cryptocurrencies are an ecosystem of transmitting value similar in nature to traditional or fiat currencies (dollars, yen, yuan, pounds, euros, etc.) except with added levels of convience and security which you do not get when you want to transmit value by giving someone a piece of paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The community which uses virtual currencies is small but growing at a substantial rate, so we are far from adoption. However, one of the exciting aspects of virtual currencies for application in developing countries is the ability of anyone with any feature or smart phone to instantly conduct international transactions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People who follow Somalia|Somaliland will well remember that last summer there was a huge kerfuffle because Barclays indicated that it was going to revoke Dahabshiil's accounts. Dahabshiil, for those who are not Somalia watchers, is the largest money transfer and financial services provider in the Somali region. Its business model outside of Somalia is very similar in nature to Western Union's traditional money transfer system (you bring your neighborhood agent cash and they transmit it to whomever you determine). Inside of Somalia Dahabshiil acts more along the lines of a traditional bank. Most people keep their money in a Dahabshiil account rather than in cash. So the kerfuffle with Barclays would mean that people in Europe|America|Canada|Australia, wherever would have to change how they were sending money to Somalia.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some this was a huge problem because they may live in a place where other options are not available. Although, since Western Union does have agents in Somalia I always felt that much of the kerfuffle was overblown. I was pleased to see the activist community successfully push for a Barclays to change their position, but the bottom line is Dahabshiil has an outdated business model and has been very conservative in pivoting from that position which opens up an innovation space for other, more nimble companies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter virtual currencies. With Bitcoin, a diaspora can easily purchase Bitcoin in their home country in their home currency from either an &lt;a href="http://37coins.com">SMS transaction&lt;/a> or an online &lt;a href="http://kraken.com">bank&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://coinbase.com">transfer&lt;/a>. Once the diaspora has Bitcoin they can then easily transfer the Bitcoin to anyone in the world as long as the recipient has a Bitcoin wallet (which can be set up nearly instantly with a system like 37 Coins offers). Boom. Remittance system blockage overcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is really exciting me, though, for a development perspective is the next level of innovation that is happening with virtual currencies which will allow the building of smart contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of smart contracts, or virtual automatic contracts, is that you can build arbitrary, neutral triggers which will then be able to transmit value from one place to another when the triggers happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="open-data-as-a-neutral-indicator-of-things-happening">Open Data as a Neutral Indicator of &amp;ldquo;Things Happening&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is further exciting is that open data movements are beginning to succeed in at least getting some amount of neutral data widely available. This is beginning to be a wave with European governments showing real leadership in this space (in particular, the UK government is doing great work here).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open data with proper APIs will be able to provide smart contracts with the link between the &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; and the virtual world which the contracts can see. So let's take a system like crop insurance. Within the year, a coder|lawyer could easily build a smart contract which would pay out based upon an inverse relationship to the rainfall (or other neutral, accessible data metric) in a given location.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="social-bonds-as-smart-contracts">Social Bonds as Smart Contracts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the ideas which the &lt;a href="http://www.cgdev.org">Center for Global Development&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.cgdev.org/page/development-impact-bond-working-group">others&lt;/a> are working on is the idea of a Develpment Impact Bond. &lt;a href="http://www.cgdev.org/blog/what-if-you-could-invest-development">Here&lt;/a> is a good overview by Owen Barder, and &lt;a href="http://www.socialfinance.org.uk/work/developmentimpactbonds">here&lt;/a> is another from Social Finance. The basic idea for Development Impact Bonds is that you build a bond structure which any company, organization, government, or individual can invest in and that will pay out upon certain, pre-determined metrics being hit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Social Finance is in the midst of working on a pilot for this in the UK where they have asked the Ministry of Justice to commoditize how much recidivism is worth to the UK economy. So when people go back into jail that costs society and if you can put a price on that cost then you can aggregate and float that price with some level of discount to any group that says they can reduce recidivism. After that, the organization who is the recipient of the bond can then determine the best way to achieve the outcome stated by the terms of the bond. Of course there will be some implementation limits built into the bond contract but for the most part those will be increasingly fewer over time. The advantage which the bond holder will get is that it will have an asset which it can leverage in interesting ways, and use fundraise in interesting ways (as it could be used as collateral).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is an idea which is intellectually appealing to me, but in practice would require a lot of human oversight. Enter smart contracts. Smart contracts could oversee the entire process automatically with no human interaction if they were properly built. This would be powerful tool for accelerating outcome based development mechanisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="smart-contracts-as-cash-on-delivery-mechanisms">Smart Contracts as Cash on Delivery Mechanisms&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Another interesting and important idea which the CGD has been interested in for years is the &lt;a href="http://www.cgdev.org/initiative/cash-delivery-aid">cash on delivery&lt;/a>. COD has a lot of relevance to impact bonds but on a more decentralized basis. Here's what CGD says about COD:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cash on Delivery is a new approach to foreign aid that focuses on results, encourages innovation, and strengthens government accountability to citizens rather than donors. Under COD Aid, donors would pay for measurable and verifiable progress on specific outcomes, such as $100 dollars for every child above baseline expectations who completes primary school and takes a test.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But here's the interesting way which smart contracts could do this. With COD you have a neutral outcome based metric (kids butts in school chairs). This metric can be aggregated with an open data push and a proper API. Then you have a payout schedule which could be per day, per week, per month, per quarter, per year, whatever. The payouts are structured based upon meeting the criteria determined in the metric. Again, smart contracts could be built which would manage this with minimal human interactivity (as long as you could get the data that is).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The interesting thing which you can do with smart contracts is that it would be trivial to have payouts to a million recipients or one recipient (once you add the addresses of the recipients &amp;ndash; as is currently being piloted in many ways with mobile money). So you could structure the COD mechanism so that A portion of the money will be paid to the central government; B portion to the regional government; C portion to the local school itself; and D portion to each parent of the students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Incentives matter and behavioral economists are continuing to find new and interesting ways to structure incentive models for positive societal change. With some minimal investment into using virtual currencies and smart contracts alongside open data initiatives we will soon reach a point where to test different incentive models will require a simple change of a few lines of code, some time, and some analysis of the outcomes in R (all of this done from anywhere in the world) to determine the viability of the incentive structure to address the problem one is trying to address. Compare that to the way in which an implementing agency today would have to pivot in order to test, pilot, or scale a hypothesis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We in the development world &lt;em>should&lt;/em> know that speed and nimbleness are just as important for development workers as they are for businesses and smart contracts + open data would dramatically increase the speed at which certain things could be addressed.&lt;/p>

I thought, coming from a Windows background, that they would be overkill and require significant resources from my very old at that time laptop. My laptop then was about a 5 year old Dell that Windows Vista barely worked on. One of the huge reasons I decided to try Linux at all was the way that it was reported to be able to handle older hardware with style and grace. That said, I am always paranoid about what processes are running at any time and have for years always kept a close eye on system resource allocation (like since about Windows 3 years). Apps which are resource hogs get uninstalled or somehow sandboxed. Apps which I do not think I will need regularly get uninstalled with a vengeance. OS components I do not want get uninstalled &amp;ndash; to the extent the OS will still work if I uninstall them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coming from a Windows background, and being generally a fairly linear unitask thinker, I failed to see the benefit in multiple workspaces. I tend to keep only a few applications opened at any one time in Windows so why would I need multiple workspaces I thought. Then I installed my first version of Gnome Shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of Gnome Shell's biggest achievements as far as I'm concerned is dynamic workspaces. The basic idea is that the desktop system creates one workspace and then if you need additional ones you can either open an application in that workspace (more on this in a moment) or you can move an application to a new workspace. The desktop system will automatically create and delete workspaces based on what you are using at any one time. It is a clutter killer (which I adore) but also extraordinarily functional.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="workspaces-for-different-portions-of-the-computing-brain">Workspaces for Different Portions of the Computing Brain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have &amp;ndash; for the most part &amp;ndash; quadroned off how I interact with my computer into a quadrons.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The first quadron is my terminal workspace. I use Guake and have written about my terminal setup &lt;a href="http://coda.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/on-shells.html">here&lt;/a>. Guake is not its own workspace, as it resides &amp;ldquo;above&amp;rdquo; all my workspaces and whenever I need it, it is a simple &lt;code>F12&lt;/code> away. In this quadron is where I install, uninstall apps, generally work &amp;ldquo;on&amp;rdquo; my computer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The second quadron is my media workspace. This is generally my workspace number 3 (or my bottom workspace in Gnome's vertical configuration of workspaces). I have set up all my media players to open in this window. So from my primary workspace I simply slide down two workspaces if I want to change the album that is playing or do something that I cannot easily do from either media keys or the panel in Gnome.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The third quadron is my reference workspace. This is the workspace where I keep all the things that I need on a regular basis but do not want cluttering my primary workspace. This is the first workspace below my primary workspace. These are, for the most part, Chrome windows which I open as &lt;code>--apps&lt;/code> which allows me to open them with no decoration (which are nothing but wasted pixels if I only want to see what X site says). In this workspace I traditionally keep open four Chrome windows: &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote&lt;/a>; my Google Calendar; my Google Drive; and my &lt;a href="https://redbooth.com">Redbooth&lt;/a>. Evernote is my filing cabinet more or less and I use it for tons of different things. They have been quite public that they will not make a desktop application for Linux (which I would use relentlessly) but their web app is not bad. It used to be a resource hog but has improved (or else my new laptop is just better able to handle it). Redbooth is the Project Management Interface we use at Watershed for years now. It handles all our tasks, etc. so I need to have this open. We use Google Drive a lot for Watershed so it is helpful to see the feed rather than simply using a file browser as the feed gives me a view of what attorneys are working on quickly. With the exception of Evernote, I'm quite happy keeping these as webapps. Even when I'm in Somaliland where bandwidth is limited, all of these webapps are extremely efficient in their bandwidth usage so once they are loaded they simply Ajax call their way through the day which saves me bandwidth and also still let's me keep everything in sync.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The fourth quadron is my primary workspace. Unless I'm deep in work on a complex task requiring multiple pdf windows or something, I keep two applications running in this workspace. I keep my primary chrome window here which always has my personal and work gmails up and whatever else I happen to be reading or writing or working on in Chrome. I also keep my Sublime window open at all times. I code in Sublime, write memos in Sublime, draft contracts in Sublime, draft laws in Sublime, generally Sublime is my &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; hub for documents. If I need to open pdf or doc or odt files I generally will pull them up from Sublime rather than opening a file browser.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts-for-workspace-bliss">Keyboard Shortcuts for Workspace Bliss&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Keyboard shortcuts. Oh how I love them. So easy to setup. Go to Keyboard in your Applications menu and then click on Shortcuts. For workspace and windows stuff, go to the Navigation sub-tab. Here's the shortcuts I use:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Move window one workspace down: Alt+Super+Up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move window one workspace up: Alt+Super+Down&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move to workspace up: Ctrl+Super+Up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Move to workspace down: Ctrl+Super+Down&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That's It! That is really all you need. Move a window up or down, and move your viewer up or down. While you are in here, do yourself a favour and go to Custom Shortcuts, Add a Shortcut, nautilus (as the command), Super+E (or whatever shortcut you fancy). Now you are a shortcut away from your file browser no matter where you are.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatic-workspace-management">Automatic Workspace Management&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I lurve automating things. With Gnome Shell it is very easy to ensure that (most) of my windows open in the specific place that I want them to. Gnome Shell extensions are lovely little applets which open up the possibilities of what you can do with your desktop. I should publish a list of the ones I use, but for now, only this &lt;a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/16/auto-move-windows/">one&lt;/a> is relevant. It is an extension which automatically moves windows to a specific workspace. That's it. So whenever I open Spotify, I have set it to open in Workspace 3. Boom! Just that simple. To set up the extensions you will need to have gnome-tweak-tool installed:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you go to the above link and push the button to install. After that open tweak and go to the Extensions tab to turn it on. You can also go to &amp;ldquo;Installed Extensions&amp;rdquo; in the gnome extensions site to turn on extensions, but generally Tweak Tool is better. Also there will be a link in Tweak Tool Extensions tab to the Extension settings. Click there. Then you will see a place to &amp;ldquo;Add rule&amp;rdquo; click there, then click the program you want and the workspace you want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you prefer the old school version (as I do) then you can use dconf tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install dconf-editor
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then from dconf you go to: &lt;code>org -&amp;gt; gnome -&amp;gt; shell -&amp;gt; extensions -&amp;gt; auto-move-windows&lt;/code>. Once you get there then you type in the correct APPLICATION.desktop file and the workspace. So the string should look something like this: &lt;code>['spotify.desktop:3', 'xnoise.desktop:3']&lt;/code>. That's it. Then whenever you open the application it will open in the correct place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

My thoughts on this are quite nascent, as is the technology, but here are my early observations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Automatic virtual contracts are, essentially, small computer scripts which are linked to virtual currency wallets. The basic idea is that a financial transaction and the terms and conditions governing the transaction collapse into a singular instrument &amp;ndash; or script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example will probably make this easier to visualize. You and I want to make a contract, say, for me to deliver to you X widgets at Y time at Z price. Perhaps you don't trust that I will be able to deliver to you the widgets at the time. Perhaps I don't trust that you will be able to pay me for the widgets when I have delivered them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a traditional contract scenario, we would overcome this lack of trust in a couple of ways. Either we would put the money into an escrow account controlled &amp;ndash; likely &amp;ndash; by one of our banks. Or you would execute a Letter of Credit from your bank (which really only addresses the latter of the trust issues). Or we would just trust each other based on our reputations or our past business dealings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Virtual automatic contracts overcome the trust issues in roughly the same ways. One of the key differences is that the computers act as the intermediaries rather than a large, stable financial institution such as a bank. While it is true that many people who operate in the global marketplace do have banks, it is also true that there are significant numbers who do not have or do not want bank accounts. Virtual automatic currencies would offer these individuals (as well as the banked individuals) a mechanism to operate in the global economy just as effectively and (perhaps more) efficiently than those individuals who are banked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The analogous transaction to the escrow scenario would probably follow a sequence such as: I offer you the contract by sending you the script; you accept the contract by transferring the cost of the contract (or part of it) to a virtual currency &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; which is controlled solely by the script; we both &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; the script out into the network which verifies all of the aspects of the contract; when I deliver and you certify delivery the script automatically transfers the virtual currency to an &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; which I control from the &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; controlled solely by the script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The analogous transaction to the letter of credit scenario or to the &amp;ldquo;just trust me&amp;rdquo; scenario would probably follow a sequence such as: I offer you the contract by sending you the script; you accept the contract by placing your &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; details into a field on the script; we both &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; the script out to into the network which verifies all of the aspects of the contract; when I deliver and you certify delivery the script automatically transfers the virtual currency to an &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo; which I control from your &amp;ldquo;account&amp;rdquo;. There are a few varietals of this script which could be developed which would (1) verify you have enough currency to pay for the delivery upon the occurrence of one or more events along the trajectory of completion of the contract and (2) structure payment schemes besides a one off payment upon delivery to other schemes staggered throughout the contract's trajectory and based upon the occurrence of one or more events.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond being able to have some amount of trust in complex commercial transactions for unbanked individuals, there are numerous other benefits to virtual automatic currencies which would extend to both unbanked and banked individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="speed-and-transaction-costs">Speed and Transaction Costs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Banks are slow. Escrow and letters of credit are costly. International wire transfers are slow and costly. Automatic virtual currencies would collapse this. Currently transaction costs in the bitcoin network for instance are on the order of 10%-50% of the costs for accepting credit cards. In low margin industries which have a lot of transactions this is a significant reduction in transaction costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, bitcoin transactions are fast. Even getting money into your bank from a bitcoin transaction is not very slow. Most payment providers in the developed world will give you the money to your account that evening after you have developed a history with them. If you and I were both to keep some not trivial amount of our working and operating capital in bitcoin already then the payment speed dividend increases dramatically because the real time sink in the network at this point is moving from the virtual currency (bitcoin) to a &amp;ldquo;fiat&amp;rdquo; currency and depositing that fiat currency into your bank account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those are two huge advantages. For me, the seller, I would receive the value almost instantly upon certification of the delivery by the buyer. For both of us, reducing the transaction costs (which are traditionally priced into the overall transaction and either shared between the seller and the buyer or just paid for by the buyer) will be reduced and thus the cost to the buyer for the widgets should be reduced.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="uncertainty-and-ambiguity">Uncertainty and Ambiguity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the things that is most promising aspects to automatic virtual contracts, but also perhaps one of the most difficult aspects in contracting generally, is their ability to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity within the contract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Automatic virtual contracts are computer scripts. Computer scripts do not like ambiguity. Indeed, computers are mostly too dumb to handle ambiguity. Presumably, it will be the role of the cryptography network supporting the contract's dissemination and execution to ensure that there is a lack of ambiguity. It is unlikely that simple transactions such as the one I've been using here will have any significant level of ambiguity to the contract whether it is virtual or traditional &amp;ndash; but for other types of contracts or bylaws (think trust establishment documents or a corporation's bylaws operating as virtual automatic contracts) where ambiguity could potentially be higher this is a bigger concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reducing contractual ambiguity is usually the lawyer's job when drafting or reviewing a contract or other instrument. In a virtual automatic contract network, though, reducing ambiguity would likely be a three prong effort shared between the lawyer, the coder (who will likely be the same in coming generations), and the network. This would put more eyeballs on the problem. Also, programming is very different than drafting a contract because the computer needs precision. This will force lawyers|coders to develop contractual instruments which rely upon verification metrics for various parts of the contract which will inherently reduce its ambiguity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When it comes to scripting, the scripting language itself handles whether a comma should be in a given location or not; there is no argument over whether to include an Oxford comma in an array; there is no argument over whether a defined term is an operative method or not. The nature of computers and scripting languages reduces these typical ambiguities into a binary determination: it is, or it is not. Judges may have to learn how to read computer scripts, but it is likely that they will have less of a role in determining whether A set of words and punctuation should yield B result or C result as that will be handled by the language and the network. This will reduce ambiguity throughout the entire commercial network &amp;ndash; a very good thing if you ask any business person you know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm using uncertainty here as analogous to risk generally, or &amp;ldquo;all the other stuff surrounding the contract&amp;rdquo;. On a simple contract which I have been using as an example in this post, there will be uncertainty for me that you will not find a better price on the widgets and just send them back to me after I have delivered them; there will be uncertainty for you that I will deliver the widgets at the quality specified. Admittedly, automatic virtual contracts cannot be a panacea to address these uncertainties because there are no real strong answers here. However, a few things could be done to address them. If we know that my widgets weigh Q grams, and we have access to a postal or courier's API then we can check that I have sent Q grams * X widgets (plus some packaging weight) to you &amp;ndash; thereby reducing your uncertainty. Of course this wouldn't address the quality of the widgets. That would be nearly impossible to overcome unless we could easily agree to a level of precision that a computer could check.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One potential way to address this uncertainty is by placing some third party &amp;ldquo;referee&amp;rdquo; into the system. These people could operate similar to how insurance adjusters worked in prior economies. They would largely be independent contractors who would work for the network and could be used to certify that I have delivered X widgets to you at Y time and they meet the quality standards we agreed to in the contract. Once the referee certifies the delivery to the network, then the script would automatically execute whatever was next in the series of events (likely, paying me). Potentially in international shipping government customs investigators (married with APIs) could also have a role in such a system. The big take away here is that wherever there is a subjective determination that some event has taken place, any way to build that into an API framework or utilization of a neutral referee would work to reduce the uncertainty. This is not necessarily transformative, indeed such systems are in place today in various capacities. The biggest difference here is that the referees could work independently and be certified and paid by the network itself so they would only have an interest in ensuring the validity of the contract rather than one party or the other succeeding (or course they could always be paid off by one side to say yes or no, but we'll likely always have to live with that uncertainty).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summation">Summation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This post has examined an extremely simple contract, which is where the ecosystem will have to begin. But once the ecosystem matures a bit the possibilities here for reducing commercial transaction friction and further decentralizing while also globalizing economies is utterly fascinating. A good friend and I are working on a business proposal which would leverage these types of transactions so hopefully there will be more on the horizon to this end.&lt;/p>

It is unfortunate that we break free of our addiction to PDFs and this is the thought behind my RMOC project. Until that is a viable option for working with PDFs, here is my suite of &lt;strong>free&lt;/strong> PDF tools that can be used in the stead of the overly engineered Acrobat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reading-pdfs">Reading PDFs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most any distro will contain a PDF reader. By default Ubuntu installs Evince which is lightweight and works as a viewer. Evince still has not implemented any highlight or annotate functions, but that is OK for me since I only use PDFs to read and then copy whatever I need into Sublime Text &amp;ndash; which is where I create 99% of my documents. One of my partners likes to use Okular which has highlighting and annotating features to it. The problem is that Okular runs on KDE a different desktop environment from what I use (Gnome) and Okular does not integrate with GTK (the Gnome Toolkit for Desktop Applications) this means that installing Okular requires a ton of packages that I would never use but for within Okular. In the past I have tried it but have found that &amp;ndash; for me &amp;ndash; it is a too-much solution. Installing Okular is straightforward:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install okular
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you are all set to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="extracting-pdfs">Extracting PDFs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Sometimes I prefer reading PDFs on Android with &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=udk.android.reader">ezPDF Reader&lt;/a> as its interface is nice. I generally will do this on my tablet. Then I simply save the PDF in my Dropbox which will sync to my desktop. After that, I forked a command line tool (I think from &lt;a href="http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=612">here&lt;/a>) for python which extracts the notes that I added to the document into a command line tool which I can then copy and paste into Sublime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use the extractor, you need to have a few packages installed first:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install poppler-data poppler-utils python-poppler
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then you will need to paste the following script into your ~/.bin folder (or anywhere else that is in your path). I called this ~/.bin/extractpdfs but of course you can call it anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-python" data-lang="python">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/span>

main()
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>If you just want to use the script as is then you can simply call the following from the command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">wget -O $FILE https://gist.github.com/compleatang/8666561/raw/79ee25d3d1a4c6f1ed7c0e9de1db951d947e3b17/extractpdfs
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>What this script does is to extract the annotations into a text output on the command line. I could not figure out how to extract the highlights because of the weird way that highlighting works and because poppler is not currently set up for that. There is a ruby gem called pdf-reader that I have worked with a bit that I &lt;em>think&lt;/em> would work for extracting highlights but I have not had the time to work with it in detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The output of calling the &lt;code>extractpdfs $PDF_FILE&lt;/code> will look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>page: 24: why did she not want to go thru her records&amp;hellip;?
page: 26: make a chart detailing her claims, his payments, and the amounts she says she is borrowing?
page: 28: use this figure as illustrative for making the chart.
page: 31: fix this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ocr-ing-pdfs">OCR-ing PDFs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you get actual paper the first thing most lawyers &lt;em>should&lt;/em> do is to scan and OCR (optical character recognition &amp;ndash; or make the scan so that you can search and copy and paste the text) the document. I use gscan2pdf to do this. It is a straight forward gui application what will ocr and clean up your pdf documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install gscan2pdf
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>I have used a lot of the OCR gui's available for Ubuntu and for my money gscan is the best. Cleaning up PDFs and OCRing them is just a click or two away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difficulty that sometimes arises is that open source OCR technology is quite a bit behind proprietary technology. On Windows there are a couple of really good OCR technologies and on OSX there are also, but those vendors ignore Linux for the most part. Given how much I use OCR I would happily pay for a Linux native solution which is not Abby's per page basis, but I have not found one that I believe will work for me. So for now, I am left with the open source solutions. Gscan will integrate with the major OCR technologies on Linux and when you go to OCR your document you can choose which one you want to use. It will not be perfect, especially if you have a bad scane, but it will be a decent 80% solution that is 100% free.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="modifying-pdfs">Modifying PDFs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Splitting PDFs, combining PDFs, deleting pages from PDFs, rearranging PDFs is most simple on Linux than it is with Adobe if you ask me. I use a great package called pdfmod which lets me do all of these things.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install pdfmod
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once you have it installed it is very straightforward to split, combine, delete pages, add pages, and rearrange pages in your PDFs. Basically the package does just what you want it to do, you can drag and drop all the pages to correctly order your PDF's; you can drag in pages from other windows; you can click on pages and press delete to remove them. It is very straight forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="summary">Summary&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Working with PDFs in Linux is not 100% ideal and the programs to work with PDFs are not cohesive as you may get with Adobe in windows or osx. However, it is imminently manageable with some combination of Evince, Gscan2PDF and PdfMod you can get to almost a complete solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

This is a perennial problem. It is always easy to remember those packages you use all the time but what about those packages that you do not but you want them there when you need them. Here is a three step system for ensuring that you never forget to reinstall packages you want when you upgrade your system or reinstall you operating system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-1----build-an-install-script">Step 1 &amp;ndash; Build an Install Script&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have slowly been speaking about the parts of my installation script over the course of most of my Linux for Lawyers series. I have written about how to use &lt;a href="http://coda.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/dropbox-as-a-settings-repository.html">Dropbox as a settings repository&lt;/a> and to automatically pull those settings in when you reinstall your system and I have also written about setting up your &lt;a href="http://coda.caseykuhlman.com//entries/2014/on-shells.html">shell environment&lt;/a>. The system that I use depends in large part on a fairly detailed installation script that I use after installing or reinstalling a Linux operating system. So I keep my packages in that install script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My install script contains a long list of the packages which I have installed previously. This is held in an array in shell scripting format. Then the install script builds a function which is creatively called &lt;code>install_a_bunch&lt;/code>. Shell scripting is not terribly easy to follow along with, but what the function essentially does is to first check if the packages I'm trying to install are already installed. Based on the return of the sudo apt-get &amp;ndash;qq &amp;ndash;dry-run call, it parses the packages into three buckets. The first bucket contains those packages which are not installed and can be found in the repositories. The second bucket contains those packages which are already installed. The third bucket contains those packages which cannot be found in the repositories. The final thing the function does is to install those packages which are in the first bucket.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Linux package managers are decentralized things. This means that you can add and remove other package repositories besides the ones that come pre-installed with the system. In Ubuntu this is done with the add-apt-repository command. The third bucket was put in because many of the packages / programs I use are installed not from the standard repositories but from specialized repositories. In Ubuntu, many packages that are in the standard Ubuntu repositories may be a ways behind the package's latest stable release so it is often necessary to add other repositories which point to the latest stable releases rather than using the standard Ubuntu releases. For example, as of this writing, LibreOffice version 4.1.2 is what is sourced from the standard repositories while version 4.2.0 is sourced from the LibreOffice repositories. For that package and others, I will use the specialized repository rather than the standard repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-2----setup-your-shell-to-log-repositories-and-packages">Step 2 &amp;ndash; Setup Your Shell to Log Repositories and Packages&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once you have an install script ready to go, then the next step is to set up your shell with shortcuts that you can use to both add a repository and install packages while also logging what you are adding into the install script.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">function&lt;/span> install&lt;span style="color:#f92672">(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">)&lt;/span>

sudo apt-get update
&lt;span style="color:#f92672">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The first function above, &lt;code>install&lt;/code>, is used so that when I'm copying and pasting from a site which tells me to do a sudo apt-get install that I just can copy the install and whatever packages I'm to install. The function will do a sudo apt-get install of the packages and then will log those packages in the install script. The line after the install function is a compdef function which enables tab completion in zsh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second function above, &lt;code>add-repo&lt;/code>, is a corollary of the install function. It performs an add-apt-repository call and then logs that in the install script. Finally it performs a sudo apt-get update which you always want to do after you add a repository so that the Ubuntu list of packages gets updated with the packages from the new repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-3----keep-it-organized">Step 3 &amp;ndash; Keep It Organized&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The logging functions above will put new repositories and packages at the end of your install script (note, adding onto the end of a text file in shell is super easy with the &lt;code>echo &amp;quot;BLAH&amp;quot; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; FILE&lt;/code> call). Then every once in a while I just organize the script. I cut and paste the repositories into the proper place in my install script and then I use ruby to organize the packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have ruby installed on your computer then from shell you type &lt;code>irb&lt;/code>. This will load the interactive ruby console. After that, here is what I do (note the $ below is the cursor):&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">$&lt;/span> a &lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">%w(&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">_CUT_AND_PASTE_THE_PACKAGES_FROM_PKGS_IN_INSTALL_SCRIPT_&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">)&lt;/span>

&lt;span style="color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010">$&lt;/span> exit
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then just copy the output from the final ruby call there into your packages array in the install script and delete the packages from the bottom. Then you are all set. You have all your packages logged and up to date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

A very intriguing concept frankly. As humans, the (relatively) neutral mechanism which we use to transfer value between humans has almost exclusively been one of the main concepts which has remained solely within the purview of sovereigns. So, what happens when currencies are no longer the purview of sovereigns? Will it work? Will it implode without the sovereignty elephant backing a currency? I have no idea, but I'm fairly optimistic that it will work. Here's why.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="currency-ecosystems">Currency Ecosystems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, as some background. Virtual currencies (not unlike &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fiat&amp;rdquo; currencies these days) exist as bits on a bunch of computers. There is no physical object which can be transfered when you need to transfer some value (pay for something). This is fairly well known by now. The most famous virtual currency, and probably the &amp;ldquo;reserve currency&amp;rdquo; of the entire ecosystem is BitCoin. If you want to understand a bit more of the background regarding virtual currencies, I definitely recommend reviewing &lt;a href="https://www.weusecoins.com/en/">this site&lt;/a> which does a good job of addressing many of the fundamental concepts in a completely approachable way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So BitCoin was the &amp;ldquo;mother&amp;rdquo; of this concept in so many respects. Of course, the creators of BitCoin relied &amp;ndash; just as we humans always do &amp;ndash; upon concepts developed earlier and in turn extended those concepts. One of the things which BitCoin did, which was necessary in order to prove its reliability to tech savvy early adopters, was to open source itself. The early adopters of BitCoin had increased certainty of the security of the code because they could see it. This was key because those who may be interested in developing an use a virtual currency will largely be those who are very particular about virtual security and other such; seeing the code is important to these people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the externalities of BitCoin opening up its system is that anyone was free to fork the code and to develop their own Coin. And people did just that. What is developing now is an entire ecosystem of AltCoins &amp;ndash; and each of which has its own &amp;ldquo;purpose&amp;rdquo;. These purposes can be of value to the holders of the Coin, or not. The key to understanding this ecosystem is that currencies only have value because &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; have agreed that there is value within them. There are now currencies which store information (Datacoin), that assist with domain name registration (Namecoin), and lots of other different purposes. Of course there are such coins as Sexcoin and Potcoin. Over time, we the networks using such coins will determine what their value is via exchanges.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="exchanges-to-reduce-friction">Exchanges to Reduce Friction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is developing within the AltCoin communities is a broad based ecosystem. Really it is a recursive ecosystem of ecosystems. This decentralizes much of how we think about value as different people and communities and ecosystems will value different things. It is like we are in the 1880's America when each Bank published its own notes; see &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/08/27/216125279/episode-421-the-birth-of-the-dollar-bill">here&lt;/a>. The difference between the decentralized nature of the 1880's America (and Europe at the time I suspect) is that now we have exchanges to go to that allow us to easily exchange any AltCoin listed on that exchange for BitCoin &amp;ndash; the reserve currency. This means that by quickly checking the exchange rate for the currency which someone wants to pay for something against BitCoin, anyone can easily price out their goods or services properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These exchanges are incredibly interesting because they help to reduce the overall friction within the ecosystem when I have a value proposition that I want to transfer to another person &amp;ndash; because I can store and keep my value in whatever way makes sense to me and then transfer that to another user who can exchange it for whatever value proposition makes sense given their current situation. We are still in the very very early days of this, but companies like &lt;a href="http://www.cryptsy.com">Cryptsy&lt;/a> have a &lt;em>very&lt;/em> bright future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="transactional-certainty">Transactional Certainty&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Lastly, the newest AltCoins are being coded to design specific problems that we face. For instance a new Coin I'm excited about working with, &lt;a href="http://www.ethereum.org/">Ethereum&lt;/a>, is building into its codebase a system of contracts. The basic idea is that a specific transaction can encode the terms of the transaction within the transaction itself. So instead of a receipt from Target which in fine print tells you that you have 30 days to return something you do not like, the transaction itself encodes this. What this allows is an entire system of transactions which previously needed arbitration to figure out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The arbitration agents of the contract are the entire network of the users of the Coin. The contracts built into Ethereum transactions will be capable of having computer precise responses to external, identifiable, quantifiable events (and I also think more subjective events but I am still trying to find to dig into the code a bit more). What are the applications of this? Tons. Option contracts jumped off the page. Escrow systems also are easy to develop. Phased delivery transactions. Pretty much the entire UCC could be coded into Ethereum and built so that when a transaction occurs it simply references back to the Digital UCC built into the code. I have a lot I want to learn about this because there are some interesting business possibilities here.

It is a great piece of kit. When you first start using Conky it can be a bit overwhelming because it has a ton of options and configuring it is not terribly straight forward for those who do not like command line and editing files. But once you get over the initial hump it is amazing. It is a set and forget tool that I have used for years with very little modification once I had my initial set up. Here is what my current setup looks like:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know what the different rings mean, but no one else does. So as a way of introduction the rings are as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Clock.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Processor load (I have an i9 processor with 8 cores so that is why there are eight half concentric rings layered into one ring).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Memory load (outside) | Battery charge (inside).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Network traffic (left side outer is outbound via ethernet, left inner is inbound via ethernet, right side outer is outbound via wireless, right side inner is inbound via wireless) | Network ports (deep inner).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drives (percent used on various drives).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>On &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/Conky">this page&lt;/a> you can see how my conky looks with other wallpapers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-conky">Setting up Conky&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In Ubuntu, Conky is in the main repositories so it is very straight forward to install:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install conky
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When the installation finishes you will be all set up. If you prefer a GUI to set up your conky with some pretty good looking initial themes, then I would encourage you to read this article over at &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/1gLQnQH">WebUPD8&lt;/a> and follow the instructions for installing conky manager.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I prefer to fork and modify other people's open source code and so that is what the rest of this tutorial will work towards. To get an idea of the different things that you can do with conky I would encourage you to glance at the above article first, and then go over to DeviantArt and look through the &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/1gLQJ9R">Conky galleries&lt;/a>. I originally did this but have heavily modified my theme which was originally based on &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/1gLR7Fv">work&lt;/a> by &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/1gLR8Jr">LondonAli at DeviantArt&lt;/a>. She has some beautiful conky themes she has built and her gallery is well worth pursuing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you find a theme which you like then you simply download the .zip file and extract it into your &lt;code>~/.conky&lt;/code> folder. Generally to do this, I right click on the Download link on the top of the right sidebar in DeviantArt, then Copy Link. After that, in terminal I type:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cd ~/.conky
$ wget -O conky.tgz $PASTE_LINK_WITH_CTRL_SHIFT_V
$ tar -xzvf conky.tgz
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Or, if it is a zip download&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cd ~/.conky
$ wget -O conky.zip $PASTE_LINK_WITH_CTRL_SHIFT_V
$ unzip conky
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once the files are extracted into your conky folder then you will want to cd into that directory and look at what you actually have. If all the files extracted into their own directory, I generally will move them back to the normal conky directory. Now, you are ready to start conky. I use the command line when I'm testing conky because you will be wanting to stop and restart it as you make hacks along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the command line again, the command to start conky is simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ conky -c $CONKY_RC_FILE
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Then, when you want to stop it you simply type &lt;code>CTRL+C&lt;/code> when you are in your terminal. (By the by, ctrl+c in a terminal is cancel. This is why in terminal you need to type ctrl+SHIFT+c to copy something. This is a bit confusing and I've been thinking I need to change this default (which you can always do by modifying your shell config files) but haven't yet done it.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was starting with Conky, I downloaded many conky configs from DeviantArt and then started conky with one, then stopped it and started it again with another, etc. until I found the one that I liked. So when you extract the archive you downloaded from DeviantArt usually you will want to see that the different conkyrc files have different names so that you can try different ones on your desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On more sophisticated setups there are two files that conky will need, a conkyrc file which is the main file and a lua file which is used to draw cool shapes and sizes. Here is my conkyrc file. If you want to see my conky.lua file it is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/Conky/blob/master/conky.lua">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I was interested in seeing if I could modify my conky to automatically pick colors that complement my wallpaper and I wanted it to run whenever I changed my wallpaper. This is a hack to be sure, but it works on Ubuntu at least. One of the things that Ubuntu (or Gnome, am not sure) does is when you tell it there is a new wallpaper but pick a file from a different location, it will copy that file into the ~/Wallpapers folder. I keep my wallpapers in my Dropbox so what I did was to set up a ruby process that watches the Wallpapers folder and when a new file is added, it modifies conky for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ruby file is pretty straight forward, but to use it you will have to install two gems with &lt;code>gem install listen miro&lt;/code>. After installing those gems, you are set.&lt;/p>

sleep
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Since the conky deamon watches the conky files and will reload itself when the files are modified you do not have to add a restart command to restart conky. To make this run on startup and to stay running as a deamon in the background along with conky this is what I did. Another gem to install with &lt;code>gem install foreman&lt;/code>. Then add a Procfile to the ~/.conky folder that looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">conky_main&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">usr&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>bin&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>conky &lt;span style="color:#f92672">-&lt;/span>c &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>coda&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>conky&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>conkyrc
&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">conky_colors&lt;/span>: &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">home&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#e6db74">/&lt;/span>coda&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">.&lt;/span>conky&lt;span style="color:#f92672">/&lt;/span>conky_colorsd
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Lastly, I added a custom startup script:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env zsh
&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#75715e">&lt;/span>source ~/.zshrc
foreman start -f /home/coda/.conky/Procfile &amp;amp;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once you add the startup script, you will need to make sure you can execute it with &lt;code>chmod +x startup.sh&lt;/code> or whatever you call it. The final step is to call the startup script when you log into your computer by adding it to your Startup Applications. After that you are all set. The startup script will start foreman, which will start normal conky with the right conkyrc that you give to it and also the conky_colorsd deamon which will watch for wallpaper changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="further-customization">Further Customization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The conky_colorsd daemon is OK. But sometimes it gets the colors wrong. Also if I used a Wallpaper from the ~/Wallpaper folder (one I've used before) or from the standard Ubuntu wallpapers, the daemon will not see those changes and will not run the modification script. So I also built a conky_colors which is executable. I symlink this into my ~/.bin folder so that I can always call &lt;code>conky_colors&lt;/code> from the command line. The process for conky_colors is roughly the same, it will look at the Wallpaper that currently is there, find its primary colors and then allow me to pick which colors I want to use for the text, ring forground and ring background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one minor hiccup in the miro gem which does not do well parsing files that have spaces in them. So sometimes when you change to a wallpaper and nothing happens, it could be because of that, running the manual script should solve that process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Voila! A completely wonderful system.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="want-to-just-copy-me">Want to Just Copy Me?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No problem as long as you have ruby installed on your system. Two steps and you're set:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;code>cd ~ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git clone https://github.com/compleatang/Conky.git .conky &amp;amp;&amp;amp; gem install listen miro foreman&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add ~/.conky/startup.sh to your Startup Applications&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

My argument to others to use your shell more is simply that you &lt;strong>see&lt;/strong> what is happening with your computer a lot easier than you can with a graphical user interface (GUI). Basically, your shell is somewhat like a glass bottom boat to see what your computer is actually doing. On linux, GUI's often have an option to pull up some of what your computer is doing, but for the most part they do not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other major argument for using your shell is that once you have it set up it is fast. Damn fast. I can do so much so quickly with my shell that takes me a lot longer with a GUI. This means that I spend last time on both billable and non-billable tasks &amp;ndash; leaving more time to do other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-a-drop-down-terminal-in-ubuntu">Setting up a Drop Down Terminal in Ubuntu&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Every POSIX system has a shell terminal application which you can use. But the first time you open it, it usually looks super scary &amp;ndash; as in DOS scary. The best news is that once you get over that initial shock (perhaps by following this small tutorial) it can be a very pleasant experience. In Ubuntu you can get to your shell by typing &lt;code>ctrl+alt+t&lt;/code> (for terminal). I don't like the main Gnome terminal application not because it is bad, indeed it is perfectly fine. I just prefer &lt;a href="https://github.com/Guake/guake">Guake&lt;/a> because it is a terminal which stays hidden at the &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo; of my screen completely out of sight. I start Guake on login, so it is &lt;em>always&lt;/em> available. All I have to do is to press &lt;code>F12&lt;/code> and I'm instantly in a terminal which drops down over my open program. I set Guake to take up about 45% of my screen real estate which allows me to see the rest of whatever application I need. There is a newer terminal application, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ozcanesen/terra-terminal">Terra Terminal&lt;/a>, which performs similarly in some respects but adds additional features, such as terminal splitting which I never used. Terra is still in development so after using it for a while I switched back to Guake which is more stable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Installing Guake could not be more simple. Drop into a terminal and type:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install guake
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Once the installation finishes, Guake will be in your applications. The next thing you will want to do is to add Guake to your startup applications. Open your applications and search for startup. When the GUI opens, click &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; then in the &amp;ldquo;Name&amp;rdquo; field type Guake and in the &amp;ldquo;Command&amp;rdquo; field type &lt;code>guake&lt;/code>. That's it. Next time you login Guake is ready for you. If you want to start guake without logging out and back in, go to your applications and search for guake and start guake terminal. Now you have your initial setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guake and Gnome Terminal (what you get when you type &lt;code>ctrl+alt+t&lt;/code>) both are simply terminals. They are like a portal to your shell program. Your shell program is distinct from you terminal program. You can use a terminal to run almost any shell program that you like. Shell programs live &amp;ldquo;below&amp;rdquo; your terminal in the stack between your eyeballs and your computer's processor. So with the same terminal, you can use different shells.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shell-programs">Shell Programs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ubuntu's default shell (and indeed many the default shell for many POSIX systems) is &lt;code>bash&lt;/code>. Bash is a good shell. Personally, I do not use it. I use &lt;code>zsh&lt;/code> mainly because its community has a ton of plugins and installation scripts which I have used to automate the installation of my luxurious shell setup. There is a long history of (ahem) discourse between the supporters of the two shells and you can google to find it. Of course, POSIX being POSIX there are numerous other options such as fish shell and other newer competitors to bash and zsh. My recommendation is to use the shell that works for you and lets you do what you need to do in the most efficient way possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ubuntu tries to keep its install wizards small so it does not install zsh by default (OSX on the other hand does I'm fairly sure), so if you want to follow the rest of this tutorial then you'll want to install zsh with the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install zsh
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When the shell is installed then you need to tell Ubuntu that this is the shell you are interested in installing. You do this with two commands. The first command finds where the zsh binary is and the second tells Ubuntu to change your shell. You copy the output from the first command (&lt;code>ctrl+shift+c&lt;/code> when you're in terminal) and paste it into the second command (&lt;code>ctrl+shift+v&lt;/code> when you're in terminal).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ which zsh
$ chsh -s $OUTPUT $USER
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>In the above command $OUTPUT is the output you get from the first command and $USER is your user name on ubuntu. After that you are all set. What I do generally at this point is to close the terminal window (in Guake this is &lt;code>ctrl+shift+w&lt;/code> but that may be what I've set up to follow Chrome rather than the standard) and then open a new terminal window. Voila, you are all set up with zsh.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="making-your-shell-your-shell">Making Your Shell YOUR Shell&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now we have all the basics setup with three simple commands in the terminal. You can easily put these into your install script to automate this process whenever you install or reinstall Linux on your machine. The next step is to make the shell YOUR shell by personalizing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main file you will use to personalize the shell is your &lt;code>~/.zshrc&lt;/code>. This is the file that zsh will automatically load by default everytime a new instance of zsh is opened. You can use this file in turn to tell zsh to load other files as we will see. The reason why I like zsh is that there are a lot of plugin which you can use to make the shell your own in a very simple way. A while ago a framework for zsh was developed called &lt;a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh&lt;/a> which kicked off the frameworks in zsh in a big way. After a while this became complicated so another team developed a system which automated how this all works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use both of these systems. I use the automated install and updating system to install, remove, and update my zsh files and I use oh-my-zsh as the underlying framework (which I modify) to do much of the heavy lifting. If you want to follow along it will not be very painful I promise. The automatic installation and updater I use is called &lt;a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen">antigen&lt;/a>. Here is how you set it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen.git $LOCATION
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When you run the git clone command it will pull down antigen but you will want to put it in whatever location you like. I do not recommend putting it in &lt;code>~/.antigen&lt;/code> because when you run the script it is going to put a bunch of other files in that location and this could cause conflicts. I put it in my &lt;code>~/coding/antigen&lt;/code> folder for instance. Now, when that finished you need to edit your .zshrc file in your favorite text editor. Here's what my file looks like.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env zsh

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>You can read more about how to use antigen bundles on their github page linked to above, but I'll walk through it. The first thing that the file does is it &lt;code>sources&lt;/code> (which in shell means load and use) the main antigen shell script. So point this to wherever you cloned their repo to. The next line tells antigen to use the oh-my-zsh framework (there are others which you could use and the github page shows how to do that). Then there is a long list of the bundles that I want to use. Bundles are simply plugins. At the end you will see a couple of non oh-my-zsh bundles sourced. Antigen knows that when you put a bundle that looks like &lt;code>user/plugin&lt;/code> to get it from the github repo. Of course, you can not use the github defaults and you can easily point it to other bundles that you may have on a private git repo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the bundles are loaded then the file tells antigen to use a specific theme. The last thing the file does is to tell zsh to load a bunch of custom files which I keep in my dropbox. That's it. The way that zsh works is that when you pass it one command and then pass it a second command that conflicts with the first then the second one always wins. This is why I source my own custom files after the framework files. This allows me to override small things that the framework does which I do not like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can look on oh-my-zsh page for a lot of different themes. Here's the theme I use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My theme tells me my username, hostname, current working directory and then tells me which rvm I'm using and how my git repo is looking (the git repo turns red if it is &amp;lsquo;dirty&amp;rsquo; or green if it is not as you can see from the different repos). If you wanted to use my theme then here is the file:&lt;/p>

One thing to note is that the colors in the server theme are bolded (this makes it easy for me to remember that I am probably ssh'ing into a server in a specific terminal and not on my computer if you did not want the bold them simply delete &amp;lsquo;_bold&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p>

This is full of a bunch of defaults I've found by stalking people's dot file repos on github. To be honest there is a lot of things in this file that I do not know what they do but solve specific problems for me. I recommend using one you find from repos and then googling as different problems arise and adding or deleting the specific parts of the config file to make it yours. That is more or less what I have done over the previous few years.&lt;/p>

I also have a collateral package for installing new ppas on my computer. I have built a bunch of network functions that I use every once in a while to figure out what the heck is happening. I also have built a f-u-nsa script which I run when I get to a new country. By changing my mac address and clearing all my cookies I think I can slightly reduce my chances of being flagged within NSA's systems &amp;ndash; this is important when you run a law firm and spend lots of time in the Horn of Africa. Also I have some functions that make working with files and modifying files easier as well as a few specific functions for assisting with different programs like npm (node package manager and cabal which is haskell's package manager and I use to keep on the bleeding edge of pandoc).&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>One thing which should be mentioned is the difference between functions and aliases. There is a subtle difference between the two. Basically an alias is like a contraction. It is just a shorthand thing for a specific other command. So there is not much you can do with it AFTER the alias. If you need to pass the function a variable (like a file or a folder or a switch) then you should use a function. If you do not need to pass a variable of any time then you can use aliases if you are not trying to do something terribly complex. If there are a lot of steps to what you are trying to accomplish then a function is usually the better way to go even if it does not require any variables. Those are my two cents, am sure others may feel differently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that is it. Type a few commands, copy and paste some files and you'll be good to go with a dynamic, fast, and totally beautiful and useable shell at the push of a button.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

Almost the entirety of this will also work with OSX for the record, save for program settings locations in OSX are different than in Linux &amp;ndash; they are usually in ~/Library/Application\ Settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-linux-usually-stores-settings">How Linux (Usually) Stores Settings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the most brilliant things about Linux systems is how Linux desktops (for the most part) store your application settings. On Windows, these are usually stored in databases which makes them difficult to sync and store. But on POSIX systems generally, and Linux in particular, settings for applications are largely stored in files. Indeed, usually files are simple text files rather than anything which is truly difficult to handle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two main implications for the operating system utilizing files rather than databases for application settings. The first is that you can move the files around to where &lt;strong>you&lt;/strong> want them to be rather than where the &lt;em>developers&lt;/em> think they should be and then you can fake the computer into thinking the files are really where the program is looking for them at. The second implication is that it is terribly easy to set your settings up to be cloud synced which means that you can always pull them in when you have a new machine or setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-installation-scripts">The Importance of Installation Scripts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the major things which Linux has showed me is how to create a fungible system. I use Ubuntu which is on a six month release cycle. This means that every six months or so I will completely format my hard drive and start from scratch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 90's I had a friend in college who used to format his hard drive all the time. He would take like one weekend every quarter and do this. It was ridiculous. At that time he was running Windows I'm pretty sure so I had no idea why he would do it so often. Perhaps he was not on Windows and had figured out back then what I know now which is that if you set things up correctly, formatting your hard drive and reinstalling everything can happen smoothly, resiliently and easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point when I update my Ubuntu release and format my hard drive the first thing I do after logging in is download and run one script. That script is a master script which runs all sorts of smaller scripts. It takes about an hour or maybe three to download and install everything depending on the bandwidth of my connection &amp;ndash; but even in Hargeisa where the bandwidth is awful it runs in about three hours. When it is finished, I have only a few things to do (like turn on a few extensions for Ubuntu-GNOME and maybe change my wallpaper) and my system will look and act &lt;strong>exactly&lt;/strong> as it did before the new installation. I will write more about this process later. Suffice it to say for this post that my Dropbox bootstrap script is a huge part of that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-a-dropbox-bootstrap-script">Setting up a Dropbox Bootstrap Script&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Given all the above, about two years ago I realized that what I needed to do was to put all of my non-data non-music non-document non-video files that I would need to make my system look and feel the same across installations in my Dropbox. Dropbox works exceedingly well for this. In Linux most programs look for their configuration file in one of a few places.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some programs look for a file in the home folder which is usually the name of the program + rc. So for example, the program htop which is a great program for seeing the processes that are currently running and a whole lot more stores its settings in ~/.htoprc.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some programs look for a set of files within ~/.config/PROGRAM_NAME/FILES.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some programs, particularly desktop (as in GNOME, Unity, Elementary, etc.) files and menus, in a various directories under ~/.local/share/STUFF.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Some programs make a folder in your home directory and put files under there. Usually these are in a folder called something like ~/.PROGRAM_NAME. For example, filezilla a popular FTP program puts its configuration files under ~/.filezilla&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you do not know in Linux terms, the &lt;code>~&lt;/code> in the above is a &amp;lsquo;contraction&amp;rsquo; for &lt;code>/home/USER&lt;/code>. This is standard across POSIX systems and is a highly utilized shorthand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since programs have different methods of placing their configuration files, setting up your own cloud sync for program settings will require that you look around in your home folder. If you are doing this, it is important to understand that when a file has a &lt;code>.&lt;/code> in the beginning of it on Linux that is a hidden file and it will not show up in Nautilus unless you press &lt;code>ctrl+h&lt;/code> (for Hidden). If you are in terminal &amp;ndash; which I highly recommend everyone to learn at least the basics of &amp;ndash; then you will not see hidden files when you type &lt;code>ls&lt;/code> (LiSt files) unless you add the &lt;code>-a&lt;/code> (for All) switch to make the command &lt;code>ls -a&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key to the whole system is creating &lt;code>symlinks&lt;/code> (symbolic link) within your user folder. Symbolic links are what makes the programs &lt;em>think&lt;/em> they are looking at a file in one place when they are &lt;em>really&lt;/em> looking at a file in another location. Files which are really symlinks look, act, and feel almost exactly as if they were actually in the place where the symlink resides rather than in the place where they actually are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have found the files that you want to have synced to the cloud it is a rudimentary process to set them up. The basic flow is as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Copy the files into your cloud sync folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a &lt;em>from&lt;/em> the new location in the cloud sync folder &lt;em>to&lt;/em> the previous location where the program will really look for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It is truly just that simple. If you want to symlink directories there is the added step of checking to see if a directory is made within the cloud sync folder and making the directory within the cloud sync folder if it is not. But that is the only added step. If you create a symlink directory, it operates &amp;ndash; for all intents and purposes &amp;ndash; just as a normal directory does. It has files inside of it and programs can look inside of the directory at the files just as they normally would.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-it-all-up-in-an-executable-script">Wrapping it All up in an Executable Script&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To automate this process is very straight forward. You simply want to create an executable script and put it in your cloud sync folder. Then you simply call that script whenever you like. Here is what I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ touch ~/Dropbox/bootstrap
$ chmod +x ~/Dropbox/bootstrap
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The first line creates a bootstrap file within my Dropbox folder; the second line makes it executable. At this point the file is simply blank. So then one needs to put something into the script to make it work. Here's excerpts from my bootstrap file.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#75715e">#!/usr/bin/env zsh

echo &lt;span style="color:#e6db74">&amp;#34;All done! Dotfiles built!&amp;#34;&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Let's walk through the script. The first line is called a shebang. It tells the computer in what scripting language the script should be run in. I chose to run this in zsh as that is my normal shell. The other major shell language, bash, could be used but there are some minor differences in the functions that would need to be worked out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most of my executable scripts, I make sure they are on Github's Gist system so that I can easily remember and retrieve them. &lt;code>jist&lt;/code> is a command line gem written in ruby that makes it easy to post, retrieve and update your Gists. I usually make a caseybang(tm) reminding myself what the code for the gist is by putting the second line as a jist line. Then I simply can copy and execute this from the command line. Largely it can be ignored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next section looks in the Dropbox folder to see if there is a Dot-Files directory. If it is not there then the script will make one. I have one there, but this is just for resiliency in the off chance that something weird happens during an upgrade. After that there are two functions which are built, file_boot and dir_boot. They do more or less what they sound like. One bootstraps individual files and one bootstraps directories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Note, in the following paragraphs the &lt;strong>first&lt;/strong> ($1 in the script) means the local or normal place on the hard drive &amp;ndash; where the program will look for the file or directory; the &lt;strong>second&lt;/strong> ($2 in the script) means the cloud sync location.]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What the function does is asks some questions. First it asks whether the first ($1) exists as a file (-f) or directory (-d) depending on whether the file_boot or dir_boot function is being called.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If it exists then the function will then ask if the first ($1) is a symlink AND whether the second ($2) exists. This usually means that I have added a file or directory to the script and it needs to bring it into my Dropbox. If this test is satisfied then the function will copy the first to the second. But if the first exists and is not a link AND the second exists then we are in a different world. This usually means that I'm reinstalling a system so we do not want to copy in the file (or directory) to the cloud sync folder as it will then overwrite my existing settings with the default settings (which is usually when this test is satisfied). After either copying over or not, depending on the test, the function will then remove the first ($1) and create a symlink from the second to the first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the first ($1) does not exist (in other words the initial test was not satisfied), but the second ($2) exists then the function will create a symlink from the second to the first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is it. It is very straight-forward. It took some massaging to get the functions correct, but once I realized the flow then it was straight-forward to create the tests and actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the script establishes the function then it simply lists the files and directories to symlink. I've put a redacted version of my complete list above to show the different locations and how I organize it. Some highlights include, autostarting settings. I keep my autostart settings in Dropbox so when I install a new system the same programs autostart. Try that in windows. Also my menus are the same across systems &amp;ndash; even for programs which I have manually placed into the desktop. Try that in windows. My desktop themes, icons, and extensions are also there so that my desktop will look and feel almost the same even when Gnome-Shell upgrades. Try that in windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I go along and add or remove programs which I want to add their settings to the dropbox folder then I simply add a new line into the appropriate section of the script by adding &lt;code>file_boot LOCAL_LOCATION SYNC_LOCATION&lt;/code> or dir_boot depending on whether it is a file or directory I'm bootstrapping. After adding the line, I save the file and then execute the script. Voila, the file is copied into my Dropbox and symlinked to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I'm installing my next update and format my harddrive, one of the first things I do in my install script is to begin downloading my dropbox. Then later in the script when it is all downloaded, I simply execute this script from the main install script which symlinks everything in and deletes the defaults which Ubuntu install wizard sets up. Voila, everything as it was before.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="improvements">Improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This script could be improved by pulling out the ~/Dropbox portion into a variable and putting that variable at the top of the script for those who may use the script in a different system or have their dropbox folder in a different location. Other than that if you have improvements definitely let me know, but all in all it is quite straightforward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At any rate, hope this is somewhat useful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking&lt;/p>

Everyone knows it. Even those who know very, very little about computers understand that you should back things up. But no one does. Let's talk quickly about the options which Linux has for backing up your files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud sync is not terribly new, but it has definitely been mainstreamed within the past year or two. Increasingly, bar associations have been distributing ethics opinions on how lawyers should keep their client's data safe. So far, no bar association that I know of has said outright that lawyers within their jurisdiction cannot keep their client files backed up to the cloud. I certainly know many lawyers who are skeptical about cloud backup and as a result do not do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet not using the cloud comes with a limitation, because cloud syncing is damn powerful. You have the ability to access your files from anywhere. You have the ability to very simply and quickly reconstitute your data after getting a new computer, formating an existing system, or when you are on a system which is not your main system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use three cloud syncing systems (two commercial providers and one that I have built for Watershed) and a physical external hard drive to back up my data. Everything that is important to me &amp;ndash; literally everything &amp;ndash; is put onto at least one of the proprietary cloud syncing services as well as my own, secure cloud server which I completely control, as well as my external hard drive. I have my data in different data centers, on different continents, and on different types of drives. It would take nuclear annihilation of the human species for me to lose anything more than a few file updates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having your data in more than one place requires that you understand the security structure of that data. For this reason my external hard drive does not travel with me &amp;ndash; because despite my previous advice it is not encrypted. For this reason I have a highly secure server hosted within Watershed's cloud that serves to only accept our git repositories and our partner's backups. I'll get to how we structure that process in a later post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-i-structure-my-cloud-syncing-system">How I Structure My Cloud Syncing System&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I use two commercial cloud sync providers, but I do not use them for the same thing. That would be a waste of the free space cloud providers offer. Personally, I use Dropbox and Google Drive. I use Dropbox as, well, a dropbox but the main way I use Dropbox is as a repository for all my configuration files. In an upcoming post, I'll walk through my Dropbox bootstrapping system, but it is very similar in nature to the system by &lt;a href="https://github.com/lra/mackup">Mackup&lt;/a>. The basic idea is that I copy folders and files into specific spots on my Dropbox and then symlink to those. I use Google Drive for all my client and internal Watershed documents. Both of my Dropbox and Google Drive are then backed up on a daily basis to Watershed's server and to my external hard drive in the office.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no reason to backup one cloud provider into another either by putting one inside the other or by symlinking between them. Not only would it be a waste of valuable space, but also it &lt;em>could&lt;/em> create an infinite loop where one or both systems were constantly updating. Since both of these services at least count versions of files against your data caps, if you tried to back up one system to another you would likely have so many versions of some files that you could creep up on your data cap quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find Dropbox to be faster for smaller files and Google Drive to be faster for larger files. I have no benchmarks for this, it is simply how it feels. Which makes this distribution of effort important.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rsync----still-crazy-after-all-these-years">Rsync &amp;ndash; Still Crazy After All These Years&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Where cloud sync providers are amazing is in how fast they can update your cloud with your files. It is grand. But you don't actually always want things to be instant. Sometimes you want to go slow. When I'm in Somaliland for instance where bandwidth can be limited I do not want to necessarily take valuable bandwidth that I may need to do research or check facebook by allowing cloud sync services to update too frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why my backups to Watershed's servers and my on-site external drive are performed on a daily basis. I set my backups to run via rsync on a cron job so I never need to worry about them. What I love about posix systems is how simple they make it to build a small script and what I love about linux is how easy it is to set up a cron job to run the small scripts on whatever basis you want the script to run. These two concepts in combination with rsync makes for a completely hassle free system. If you do not have rysnc on your system then simply &lt;code>sudo apt-get install rysnc&lt;/code> or install it from your app store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, I built a backupjobs script in my &lt;code>~/.bin&lt;/code> folder:&lt;/p>

&lt;span style="color:#75715e">## REDACTED&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The script is fairly straight forward. The first section of the script simply sets up defaults which I can use throughout the rest of the script. The second section then checks if Watershed's cloud server is available and if so, it rsync's the designated folders into the server. rsync has an absolute ton of options which allow it to do a great variety of things. If you want to understand what each of the switches I have set up do (switches mean the &lt;code>-rtpovclHzs --progress --delete --ignore-existing&lt;/code> portion of the script) then simply go to your terminal and type &lt;code>man rsync&lt;/code>. If you are too lazy to read all of the man page &amp;ndash; and I don't blame you because it is long and I've been working through this for a while now, then you can simply copy the switches and know that they will make a mirror online of the current state of your data. This is not a backup setup, it is a mirroring setup. The major difference between the two being if you delete something locally it will be deleted on the remote server. If that is not what you want then you would simply delete the &lt;code>--delete&lt;/code> switch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one minor gotcha with rsync. If you look at the difference between the last two rsync calls within the &lt;code>Step 2&lt;/code> section you should see a very small difference. What is different is that in the final call there is a slash at the end of the reference which does not exist in the previous one, in other words the difference is &lt;code>$BASIS/sites/&lt;/code> and &lt;code>$BASIS/Insync/caseykuhlman@watershedlegal.com&lt;/code>. To rysnc the latter means to copy the directory (and anything inside of it based on the &lt;code>-r&lt;/code> switch earlier in the command) so that there will be a &lt;code>caseykuhlman@watershedlegal.com&lt;/code> directory within the destination. To rsync the former means to copy everything inside of the directory so that there will not be a &lt;code>sites&lt;/code> folder inside the destination.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last major thing that I have on the script is a notification system which sends me a &lt;a href="https://pushover.net">Pushover&lt;/a> alert whenever the script has run. Since I run the script each night, if I do not wake up to a notification then I know that it has not run. I have yet to not have that happen except for when my computer is off or I'm in transit but usually it is fine as everything will get backed up the next day. The notifications tell me whether it has backed up to the onsite external and/or the server so I quickly can tell what has happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automating-rsync-with-cron">Automating rsync with cron&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cron jobs are amazing. This will be quite quick as it is very very straight forward. The script I showed above is saved as ~/.bin/backupjobs. (Note after you save a script do not forget to make it executable by running &lt;code>chmod +x&lt;/code> on your system.) Then all I have to do is add the following line to my crontab by running &lt;code>crontab -e&lt;/code> (for edit) from my terminal&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">42&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#ae81ff">03&lt;/span> * * * /home/coda/.bin/backupjobs
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Cron is a bit confusing at first, but here is what is happening. The first field is the minutes, so this job is to run at 42 minutes. The second field is the hours, so this job is to run at 03 hours, or 0342. The third field is the day of the month (in other words if you wanted to run monthly jobs you would set this to run on a particular day of the month &amp;ndash; maybe the 1st or the 15th or whatever), the * in the field means every day of the month. The next field is the month of the year, so this job is to run every month of the year and every day of the month. The final field is the day of the week. So the last three fields having a * means that the script should run at 0342 every day. The final portion is simply the script that the cronjob is supposed to run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's it. Now everything is automated. I save files in my Dropbox or Google Drive or other folders during the day and at night my rsync and cron jobs back those up automatically to my onsite external and Watershed's servers. Voila. Completely automated, nuclear attack (but not nuclear annihilation) proof system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

This isn't necessarily new; indeed, it is what Marx was against; it is what communism tried to resolve; it is largely the impetus behind the late nineties anti-globalism push; and it is what Occupy was largely all about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I'm not anti-markets. They can be incredibly efficient, and democratic, means of organizing many things. The efficiencies within markets largely stem from their ability to reduce complexity to a simple proxy with which to conduct arbitrage and commerce: price. In this sense I'm referring to markets in the less restrictive (commercial) sense rather than the larger sense (which would integrate idea markets and such). The problem that I have with markets is that they can easily be captured, and the easiest path to capture a market is to restrict information flows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Farmers in the United States understand what the price &lt;em>is&lt;/em> for their crops; they can easily research trends within their profession to understand how to increase yields. Farmers in Burkina Faso largely do not (granted this is rapidly changing, but I'm only using this in service of the larger point). The difference is not only the farmers professional ability to cultivate although those may exist; the major difference is the information they receive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Steve Ballmer can easily predict the precise time in which he &lt;em>should&lt;/em> sell his Microsoft stock in order to avoid a major dip in price. I cannot. Again, the difference is not our relative ability to play the stock market game, but indeed it is the divergence in our information &amp;ndash; he having much more than I as to the current state of play within Microsoft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the information flows are somewhat equalized then the competition aspects of the market &amp;ndash; which are one of its highest values &amp;ndash; can be implemented. Without some level of information equalization competition simply does not exist within the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why we have insider trading regimes. This is why the internet is so terribly powerful and has so drastically disrupted the previous industrial age status quo. Under the previous status quo, big was better precisely because big allowed you to gather, analyze, and act upon lots of information. In the information age big is not necessarily better because you do not have to be big to act upon lots of information (the gathering and analyzing may happen inside or outside of your organization).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The music industry is a good icon for what the differences between industrial age markets | information and information age markets | information. Previously large labels were important because they could afford to have recruiters understand many different beats (journalistic beats, not Kanye's) as well as having lots of market research as to what was selling and what was not. This was a massive competitive advantage. Now, however, even the smallest label can easily observe different beats across the world and the spectrum of genres without leaving their computer by simply following blogs, podcasts, and having a bandcamp / soundcloud / spotify / rdio account. Small labels can also gain an understanding of the market effects of their artists with a precision that Capital Records never could have understood in the 1980's. So, as far as information, there is only minor differences between small and large labels at this point. There are differences between the two which largely reduce to the amount of marketing an entity can put behind a piece of art &amp;ndash; but with social media and online marketing reaching maturity those are also quickly collapsing (this is, however, not within the scope of what I'm speaking to with this post).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have categorized this post as &amp;ldquo;politics&amp;rdquo; for a reason. What irks me about the push from the far left and far right against and for supremacy of the markets is that they are both largely missing the point. The point is not markets themselves. Markets are simply a mechanism. I wish that we would focus our political discussions a bit more on what actually makes markets work. Although there are other things to discuss, information flows are one of the predominant factors. If we want to fix health-care, then why are we not worrying much more about information flows within the health-care market (and information's paternal cousin: actual choice)? If we want to ensure that America's place as one of the center's of innovation within the world continues then why do we continue to work against opening up information flows by engaging in reductive arguments (markets good|markets bad) while those that understand the power of information to capture and control markets continue to operate behind the scenes to close things down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course there are strides to increasing information flows. We have made absolutely astounding progress within my lifetime. And I hope that continues because we will be a better species for it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The people who most interested me were wary of centralized control, but they were not free market libertarians. They believed in the power of competition, but they also believed that some of society's most important achievements could not be incentivized with economic reward. They called themselves entrepreneurs but worked mostly in the public sector. They were equally suspicious of big government and big corporations. From a certain angle, they looked like a digital-age version of such nineteenth-century anarchists as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon or Mikhail Bakunin. Yet beneath that strange, hard-to-place eclecticism, a core philosophy seemed to unite all their efforts, even if it didn't fit comfortably into the existing categories of political belief.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>~ Future Perfect by Steven Johnson &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Future-Perfect-Case-Progress-Networked/dp/1594631840">Amazon&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Services are delivered by companies. But we need the government or else the greedy capitalists will take everything. But the government is inefficient and slow &amp;ndash; just look at the Post Office. But&amp;hellip; But&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dirty little secret is that no one knows necessarily what the right answer to this question is because we are still learning the right solution for a particular and the right solution is constantly changing. Instead of thinking in binary terms maybe it would be more helpful to think in terms of a spectrum with fully public delivery on the one side (passing legislation would fit here &amp;ndash; we probably do not want the rule-making function of governance to be within the private sector and even more susceptible to private capture than it currently is) and fully private delivery on the other side (selling slurpees &amp;ndash; we probably do not want selling of fungible goods to be within the private sector which has little incentives to innovate). In between these extremes there is a very large space in which operators can work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the arrangements I work in routinely for Watershed's clients are Public-Private Partnerships or PPP's. You know these from such hits as the private vendors operating services within national parks, or stadium builds which are usually a mix of public and private financing. These partnerships allow for a wide variety of delivery possibilities that are not nearly as limiting as a simple binary question of public v. private. Instead of focusing on the binary nature of service delivery within our policy debates which characterizes the delivery of services as either &lt;em>purely private&lt;/em> or &lt;em>purely public&lt;/em> each with its advocate class and all unable to resolve their differences or get things done so that people can get to the task of l i v i n, perhaps we should think more in terms of a spectrum. Focus our thinking about service delivery on a spectrum rather than a binary on-off switch allows us to focus our debates on finding the right point along the spectrum to deliver the services which we are speaking to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To Europeans this debate that occupies our time, the government is great v. government sucks debate, is hilarious. I get asked about it a lot. It is intuitive to most Europeans that service delivery operates on a spectrum. Services in Europe are routinely modified within the spectrum and also change over time due to efficiencies, politics, or many other factors. Last year there was an outcry within the UK as the conservative government was trying to move the National Health Service along the spectrum towards the private side which raised many alarms for people. But that debate, and many others within the politics of service delivery in Europe happen without the sky is falling, scream at your TV, Nancy Grace style of debate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like that part of Europe. A lot. Because generally when the population that doesn't know anything about the delivery of such services simply gets out of the way things happen in a pretty smooth way. Not all the time. But most of the time when people who don't know things about things let the people who do know things about things do their jobs things run pretty well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course there are differences between the two. Incentives for one are different. Private sector actors have incentives to optimize their profits. To think of short term gains over long term innovation. To reduce costs and simplify delivery mechanisms. These are all well and good, but there is a place for them. Public sector actors have a different set of incentives. To ensure the widest access to the services. To ensure the right costing is built into the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difference in these set of incentives (of which the above is meant to be illustrative) are important to understand. But our polity just needs to remember that there is space within these incentives for harmonization. Once we stop thinking in the simplistic terms of &amp;ldquo;Government good&amp;rdquo; | &amp;ldquo;Government bad&amp;rdquo; and start asking the question of how this service should be delivered based on what &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; are trying to accomplish. Then a whole world of policy solutions is opened to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try it during the upcoming election season. Watch a debate and ask yourself if the debaters are being overly reductive in how they are approaching a service delivery question. Those that are not being overly reductive &amp;ndash; that are in the business of finding solutions which will actually move us along a path rather than simply spewing forth banal answers &amp;ndash; those are the ones that I will be voting for.&lt;/p>

I don't need an ethics opinion from my bar association to understand that it is a bad thing to have a bunch of client stuff on an unencrypted drive that is constantly moving around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[WAIT, what're you talking about?]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK. So let us take a step back. There are a bunch of ways in which you can secure data. There are physical security measures like having a guard at your office, keeping computers in safes, chaining computers to desks and other such physical security measures. I'm not going to talk about those as they do not apply to anyone I know. I hope the data center which hosts my servers have some of them, but for most normal lawyers these are overkill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also non-physical security measures like putting a password on a file, on a directory, or on your operating system. All of these are well and good, but here is the dirty little secret that most people don't really know &amp;ndash; if someone gets access to your hard drive they can still get at a lot of that data. If someone has physical access to your hard drive then they can simply mount it onto their computer. Once your hard drive is mounted onto their system then the password from your OS and most of your other non-physical security measures are mooted by the fact that they will have root access to your hard drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easiest way to solve this problem is to encrypt your entire drive (or a partition). In Ubuntu, this is super simple. All you have to do is to tell Ubuntu to encrypt the entire drive when you are running the install script for Ubuntu. Voila. Totally encrypted drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally I use one password for the encryption unlock which is &lt;em>only&lt;/em> used for this purpose. I use a separate password for my OS login; I use neither of these passwords anywhere else on the internet. Indeed, these are the only two passwords which I really need to remember. The remainder of my passwords live in a KeePass database which in turn resides in my Dropbox account. They are all very long and very arbitrary which keeps them as secure as possible. I change them frequently and use two-step authentication everywhere I can. Yet none of that would matter if I did not have my hard drive encrypted and someone gained possession of my hard drive. Then all of my client data would be completely compromised and there is nothing I could do about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am sure that Windows and OSX have solutions for this as well. I'm also sure that neither is nearly as easy as it is on Ubuntu. Linux guys get security in a way that others don't. So whatever OS you are on, encrypt your hard drives and make sure that you can remote wipe any phones or tablets (which Android makes very easy and I'm sure iOS does as well).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking.&lt;/p>

Indeed, this has been on my mind for a while and was one of my motivating, longer term reasons for thinking that some kind of text-based &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown">legal document format&lt;/a> was necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the production of many documents, lawyers need not worry too much about what goes into repos as it is only the final version of the document which is shared publicly. That final document is likely to be a redacted .pdf so there is no need to worry about the history of the memo, filing, or whatnot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, if lawyers were to utilize git for negotiation they would need to be careful about what their commit history looked like, because opening up one's history of thinking about a document could reveal too much to another party one was seeking to contract with. Although I'm generally all for openness there is a time and a place for that, and transaction negotiation is not the time and place to necessarily be open and transparent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This piece is meant simply to think through a concept that outlines my thoughts on how a negotiation backed by git &lt;em>could&lt;/em> work. Of course, this would need to be tested to determine its feasibility, the problems and holes it may present to practitioners, etc. As a sidenote, if anyone is interested in conducting some mock negotiations on GitHub to try to identify where the sticking points are in this, I'm 100% game.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scenario">Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two parties are negotiating a contractual relationship. Both parties have lawyers who understand how git works and use text-based documents to draft their contracts. In theory, this would work with Word based documents with something like &lt;a href="http://vitus.wagner.pp.ru/software/catdoc">catdoc&lt;/a> and some gitattribute &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes">magic&lt;/a>, but those are still problematic to diff and people would already use Word's track changes for worse or better.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="overview">Overview&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The party initiating the contract, Party A, speaks to its lawyers who modify one of their templates to reflect the preliminary terms and parties which the Party A passes along to its lawyers. That portion is practice, but after that is when this concept begins to differ from current practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Party A's lawyers develop the Draft 0 of the proposed contract, they then open their repository for this matter to opposing counsel. When they open this repository, however, they only give allow opposing counsel to access one branch. This branch could be called &amp;ldquo;external,&amp;rdquo; but because of git defaults it is likely to be the &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch. For the purposes of this piece I will refer to the &amp;ldquo;master&amp;rdquo; branch as the &amp;ldquo;external&amp;rdquo; branch, but of course they could be named whatever make sense to the counsel in question. The reason for only allowing opposing counsel to see one of the two branches is to hide the internal work from opposing counsel. Another way that Party A's lawyers could do this is using a submodule, but theoretically using submodules rather than branches seems more complicated to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once Party A's lawyers open up the repository to Party B's lawyers, then Party B's lawyers make their own internal branch and perform their review. Then the negotiation takes place via a series of pull requests between the parties until the master branches of both parties have no differences. At that point, the parties have agreed on all the terms of the contract and it can be signed by the parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-prior-to-negotiation----party-a">Steps Prior to Negotiation &amp;ndash; Party A&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All of Party A's work prior to opening up the repo to Party B's lawyers should be encapsulated in a branch which will be restricted to that Party and its lawyers only and will not be opened to opposing counsel. This will keep internal discussions or changes that may reveal the Party's position in a branch which opposing counsel cannot see. Git offers (at least) three commands which could be used in this workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first command is &lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge --squash internal&lt;/code>. What this command will do is to first switch to the master branch and then merge in the work from the internal branch. The most important part of the command is the &lt;code>--squash&lt;/code> switch. When git merges the changes from the internal branch into the master branch, counsel will not want all of the commits to be shown, but what it will want is the final document (likely with comments redacted if they have been put into the document along the way) &amp;lsquo;squashed&amp;rsquo; down. Without the &lt;code>--squash&lt;/code> switch, then the merge would bring in all of the commits during the workflow. That is very unlikely to be what Party A's lawyers want to do as it will very likely reveal some positioning or other things that the counter Party's lawyers could use in their negotiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second command, and the one that I would personally start with, is &lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git rebase --interactive internal&lt;/code>. This command is a more powerful version of the &lt;code>git merge --squash&lt;/code> command. Rebasing is slightly different than merging, but for the purposes of this piece, those are largely immaterial. If you want to see a deeper discussion of rebasing, Scott Chacon's &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing">Git book&lt;/a> is the best place to start. What this command will do is to bring up an editor so that the lawyer rebasing the internal branch onto the master branch will be able to pick and choose which commits are brought into the rebase and which are not. In addition, with an interactive rebase such as this, one can also squash down the commits as with &lt;code>merge --squash&lt;/code> command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third command, and probably the least optimal command to use at this stage in the process is &lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git cherry-pick --no-commit ..internal &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit&lt;/code>. &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick">Cherry-picking commits&lt;/a> is, to be honest, not exactly what should happen at this point. Cherry-picking commits is probably more likely to be used later in the process but it &lt;em>could&lt;/em> potentially be used at this point. Fundamentally, what the command does is to switch to the master branch and to bring in all of the changes from the internal branch which are not currently in the master branch. The key with this command is the &lt;code>--no-commit&lt;/code> switch. This tells git to apply the changes from the internal branch but to not make a commit for those (which is the default behavior). In this way, the command works very similarly to the above commands. Unlike with the merge and rebase commands, with this command the counsel merging the changes from the internal branch would have to explicitly commit on the master branch once the changes have been applied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, to summarize, here are the steps that Party A's lawyers took:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Initialize a blank repository for this matter (&lt;code>git init MATTER&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create branch &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; and switch to using that branch (&lt;code>git checkout -b internal&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Drop template into internal branch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work on internal branch until satisfied.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Checkout master branch (&lt;code>git checkout master&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Combine the work into one final commit within the master branch via one of the three commands above.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once the lawyers for Party A are satisfied that the Draft 0 is ready to share with the lawyers for the counter party, they simply open up the master branch of the repo to Party B's lawyers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-prior-to-negotiation----party-b">Steps Prior to Negotiation &amp;ndash; Party B&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In this scenario, Party B's lawyers are simply responding to the draft contract submitted by Party A's lawyers. This is, of course, a simplified scenario to illustrate the point. In actuality, Party B and Party A could both have a starting contract they are interested in having as the basis for the final contract, but for the purposes of this exercise that adds unnecessary complexity. So let us stay with Party B simply responding to the initial draft produced by Party A.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Party A's lawyers open the repo to Party B, then Party B's lawyers will clone Party A's master branch (which is all they can see). After cloning the master branch, Party B's lawyers will immediately create their own &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; branch. They would then conduct their review of the contract based on that &amp;ldquo;internal&amp;rdquo; branch. The commands used by Party B here follow the sequence above:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Clone Party A's repo (&lt;code>git clone SERVER:REPO&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an internal branch (&lt;code>git checkout -b internal&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Do work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once the parties are ready then the negotiation would begin. I can think, conceptually at least, of a couple of ways in which the negotiation could be conducted. The first way would be to conduct a negotiation by breaking the negotiation into pieces and negotiating each piece. The second way would be to conduct the negotiation as a whole. The former is probably better for complex transactions, especially when there are teams of lawyers working on different pieces of the transactions. The latter is probably better for simple negotiations where the pieces negotiation is overly complex. Let's think through these in order.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="negotiation-by-pieces">Negotiation by Pieces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once Party B has noted (via its internal branch) the areas of the Draft 0 of the contract it has objections to, it would then classify these into issues. For each of the issues Party B wishes to address within the negotiation process, it would create a new branch off of Party B master branch. This is somewhat analogous to forming a topic branch in normal git flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From each of the issue branches, Party B's lawyers could make the modifications to the contract they are interested in and send a pull request to Party A's lawyers. If the changes are agreeable to Party A, then those can be immediately merged into the master branch of both parties. Where changes require dialogue between the parties, that dialogue could happen within the comments on the web hosted repo, on email, over the phone, in person, however. In this instance, since the changes have been discreetly identified they can easily be merged into the master branch of both parties, changed by either party, or rejected as needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cycle could then be repeated as many times as necessary until both parties agree. So to summarize these steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Party B: creates issue branches for each of the issues it has with the contract (&lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git checkout -b ISSUE_A&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party B: counter proposes language for each of the issues within the issue branch in question.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party B: sends pull requests to Party A for each of the issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both parties: merge the issue branch into their master branches as issues are agreed in the direction of Party B's counter proposed language (&lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge ISSUE_A &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git branch --delete ISSUE_A&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both parties: delete the issue branch from both repos as issues are agreed in the direction of Party A's originally proposed language (&lt;code>git checkout master &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git branch --delete ISSUE_A&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Both parties: work from the issue branch as the language goes back and forth (&lt;code>git checkout ISSUE_A&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rinse and repeat as necessary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>When all of the topic branches have been merged into both masters or deleted without merging, then the negotiation is complete. Both parties should do a quick diff of the masters to ensure that there are no discrepancies. Thereafter the contract is ready for signature and execution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="negotiation-by-cycles">Negotiation by Cycles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once Party B has noted (via its internal branch) the areas of the Draft 0 of the contract it has objects to, and it has refactored those provisions into its counter-proposed language, it would then &lt;code>git merge --squash&lt;/code>, &lt;code>git rebase --interactive&lt;/code>, or &lt;code>git cherry-pick --no-commit&lt;/code> those changes into its master branch. Once it has brought in its changes wholesale, it would send a pull request for the entire master branch to Party A.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thereafter Party A would work up its counterproposal via its internal branch after merging in the changes from Party B's master to Party A's internal. When it was ready with a counterproposal it would &lt;code>git merge --squash&lt;/code>, &lt;code>git rebase --interactive&lt;/code>, or &lt;code>git cherry-pick --no-commit&lt;/code> those changes into its master branch and send a pull request to Party B.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This cycle would then continue until both parties were satisfied. So to summarize these steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Party B: works on its counter proposal via its internal branch.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party B: brings in the changes to its master branch and sends pull request.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party A: merges Party B's master into its internal branch (&lt;code>git checkout internal &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git merge SERVER:REPO master&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Party A: works on its changes and brings those into its master via one of the three reductive commands above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rinse and repeat as necessary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>When both of the parties have no further changes to the text, then the negotiation is complete. As with the prior methodology, both parties should perform a diff of the two masters to ensure that there are no discrepancies before the contract is fully ready for signature and execution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The advantage of the negotiation by cycles workflow is that there is less branching and moving pieces to worry about. Indeed it is rather similar to how negotiations are conducted at present but with an overlay of git which will retain all of the internal work as well as the communication between the clients (which to be fair both methodologies will do). The advantage of the negotiation by pieces workflow, though is that proposals and counterproposals which may contain numerous discrete issues to be addressed within a complex negotiation, are not separated out into pieces as they are in the previous negotiation workflow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, when the parties have agreed to the substance of the contract, the lawyers for both parties can produce two distinct pieces of work. The first is the final contract which will be signed and executed as required for the jurisdiction in which it is being performed. The second would be an internal archive of the entire repo. This archive provides the &amp;ldquo;legislative history&amp;rdquo; of the contract and could illuminate some of the parties&amp;rsquo; intent if the contract were ever to be litigated. Of course, the admission of the repo archive would be subject to the rules of evidence at the time one of the parties sought to have it admitted, but that would be a discussion for another time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

Not on many, but on a few. Oh, and my wife is an amalgamated character in the book.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chasing Chaos examines the lives that aid workers lead and the work which aid workers do in vivid clarity and with honesty, clarity, and warmth. Highly recommended book; and not only because I know Jess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When someone says they work for a law firm, most people who are not lawyers have certain cultural benchmarks in which to orient themselves around some idea of what that lawyer's life may be like. Whether it is because the non-lawyer was an English major and read One L as they considered law school, because they watched L.A. Law, Ally McBeal, Boston Legal, or Suits, or because they have watched Erin Brokovitch or any of Grisham's books/movies &amp;ndash; no matter the case, most are able to comprehend to a certain degree what the lawyer's life is like. Sure cultural benchmarks are subject to Hollywood mandated arbitrary drama which often fails to portray the fuller reality of its subject matter. But at least these benchmarks provide an icon in which to begin discourse. Similarly, when someone says they are a doctor, people can refer to the cultural benchmarks of ER or Grey's Anatomy or Scrubs. Finance? Wall Street, and any of the recent movies which came out after the 2008 crash. Firefighters. Policeman. Nurses. Teachers. These are all easy to talk about when meeting people because icons from popular culture provide an entry point to begin communicating what one &amp;ldquo;does&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those of us who live the life which I live do not have such a luxury. The aid and development businesses are foreign to many folks not only because of the &amp;ldquo;exotic&amp;rdquo; locations in which aid and development take place, but because the work that aid and development workers do is not fully understood within mainstream Western culture. It is certainly well understood in mainstream Asian, African, and Latin American cultures as they have lived through, or are living through, the arc of how modern aid and development works. Chasing Chaos is a book which explains the life that I live &amp;ndash; with all its contradictions, tensions, nuances, stresses, pleasures, and excitement &amp;ndash; much better than I ever could.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Jess asked me if I would read an early copy of the book, I told her I was happy to and that her publisher should send a copy to our temporary apartment in Nairobi which we are so rarely at, that the caretaker called Leigh the other day to ask if we were still living there; both of us recently have been &amp;ldquo;on mission&amp;rdquo; a lot. Exotic Apartments, Ngong Road (Across from Nairobi Baptist Church), Nairobi, Kenya is the address I facebook messaged to Jess. At the time I thought, if her publishers wondered whether she was going to go all A Million Little Pieces on them, perhaps sending early review copies to the above address may make them more comfortable as to her credence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jess does not have the most field cred of any one I've ever met. Yet she has certainly done some hard time. One of the most refreshing things about the book, and one of its most worthwhile aspects is that Jess is honest about that fact, as well as everything else. While the book is peppered with hilarious anecdotes &amp;ndash; Jess being at the farther end of the funny people bell curve on the storytelling front &amp;ndash; its is also salted with tears. Honest, genuine, heartfelt tears. This life and this work that aid and development workers embark upon so often oscillates wildly between stomach bursting laughter and shoulder seizing weeping &amp;ndash; Chasing Chaos captures these oscillations, and the doldrums in between the ends of the spectrum, perfectly. It illustrates how it feels to be exhausted, filthy, drenched in sweat, and have to deal with yet another problem that you did not anticipate. It also illustrates the joy which very few have an opportunity to understand, the joy of how even small victories feel when achieved despite obscene obstacles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps my favorite aspect of the book is that Jess never loses sight of the humanity of this business. Fundamentally humanitarian aid and development are about helping people. It is certainly an imperfect industry. Of course for those of us in this industry it is easy to get more hung up on the fact that we cannot go to Starbucks on our way to work and spend more time focusing our mental energies on our personal deprivations than on the people we are supposedly helping. Between the outwardly selfless actions we are supposed to be performing and the (at times) inwardly selfish motivations which drive us to take those actions it becomes very easy for us to lose sight of the human beings around us &amp;ndash; whether those are national colleagues not entitled to evacuation if it all goes south, or the beneficiaries who are so often not given a voice in the matter at all. What Jess is able to accomplish in her memoir is to examine both sides of the outwardly selfless and inwardly selfish equation without losing her focus on the people she has met along her own journey. Everyone in the book, no matter where they come from, their class or stature or background, is treated as an individual, unique human being. In the haze of travel and constantly changing environments, in the blur of the mountains of work we very often face, this is a difficult challenge even for the most altruistic of aid workers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As Jess is tracing her own career development, during the latter portions of the book, the narrative turns to a more reflective examination of the aid business. Her examination of the contradictions and tensions underlying the work, I suspect, will resonate with many. These are the things which we talk about at expat parties and other gatherings of those of us who live &amp;ldquo;The Life&amp;rdquo; whether in New York, Geneva, London, the Hague, Nairobi, Monrovia, Colombo, Khartoum, Aceh, Kabul, Bratislava, or Mogadishu. Like other groups of professionals, when we gather we are bound to talk about work. She illustrates clearly many of the things that have been, and are, wrong with and many things that are right about the aid business in language which those who have not attended such an expat party and participated in such discussions can easily understand. The book does a fine job of using the human elements of its narrative to illustrate her larger perspective as to where aid is at this particular moment in time. Her points, while not unfamiliar to most in the business, are easily approachable to those who are not &lt;em>in&lt;/em> the business.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chasing Chaos is a book which provides a holistic view of our world, our jobs, and our lives. If you are currently living &amp;ldquo;The Life&amp;rdquo; you should read this book for the stories &amp;ndash; which I am positive will resonate deeply with your own experiences and journey. If you are thinking about getting into &amp;ldquo;The Life&amp;rdquo; then you should certainly read this book as it provides the best glimpse I have read as to what this is like. If you have loved ones or friends in &amp;ldquo;The Life&amp;rdquo; you should very much read this book as it will explain in a way that perhaps your loved one or friend cannot what their life is like: what they think about, how they feel, and what they actually do. Personally, I have never given my mother or father any book in this genre, until now.&lt;/p>

Mostly the changes should be transparent to users. Now that I feel that am getting a better handle on Ruby, I wanted to refactor the code quite a bit. There were a couple of motivations for this. First, I wanted to put the code more inline with common rubyisms and software construction methods. Second, I wanted to make the gem more flexible. It was fairly straightforward as previously conceived. There was only one class, no modules, and all the functionality resided in one huge file. Third, speed. Although most lmd files will be quite tiny and any modern computer can parse them and refactor them into md files within milliseconds, faster is always &amp;gt; slower.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="refactor-into-multiple-modules-and-classes">Refactor into Multiple Modules and Classes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I started the refactor by building two modules. First there is the main LegalMarkdown module which operates as the overall wrapper for the system. I wanted it to be a module so that other code (predominantly &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/rmoc">RMOC&lt;/a>, which is upcoming once I release legal_markdown 1.0) can pull in the gem functionality in a more efficient and modular way. The LegalMarkdown module has a simple controller to direct the actions of the gem. For now it is fairly rudimentary, one of my next steps will be to utilize Ruby's OptionsParser now that the functionality of the gem is becoming more complicated. So the module operates as the parent of the gem, and has one method which controls what the gem does when the module is called. For now there are two modules which live directly &amp;ldquo;under&amp;rdquo; LegalMarkdown. The first module automatically builds the YAML front matter for users. This functionality has existed since v0.1.4 and I have to refactor that code in the coming times. The second module abstracted the LegalToMarkdown functionality into its own module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly with the top level module, I abstracted LegalToMarkdown a bit. The entry point to the module is a controller file which determines how the module will perform. The file contains two methods. One of which controls the lmd -&amp;gt; md functionality and another which controls the lmd -&amp;gt; json functionality. There is probably too much logic in this file right now and I likely should abstract some of it to the LegalMarkdown controller which sets everything up to run a parsing incident more efficiently, but it is still a work in progress. To run the parsing incident I abstracted out the previous gem functionality into a couple of other files based on the steps required to parse a file. This is, perhaps, not optimal, but it is what makes sense to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step to any parsing incident is to load and parse the input file. This content is an &amp;ldquo;thing&amp;rdquo; in ruby so it made sense that the content to be parse would be put in a class. When I call Class.new, Ruby will load the file, parse it, integrate the proper submodules of LegalToMarkdown module and get everything &amp;ldquo;ready&amp;rdquo; for the LegalToMarkdown controller to run the remainder of the parsing incident. Again, I'm not sure if this optimal software design as I'm still learning, but it seems to make sense to my and I can &amp;ldquo;visualize&amp;rdquo; where everything is at any point in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of the process I abstracted into modules under LegalToMarkdown so that they can be integrated on a case by case basis depending on what the file needs to actually do. For instance if the file does not have a leaders block then there is no need to run that code. Similarly if the file does not have any mixins or optional clauses there is no need to run that code. It took me a while to figure out how to properly pull in the modules based on the conditions of the content. I still don't feel that I fully understand &lt;code>extend self&lt;/code> and &lt;code>self.extend&lt;/code> and &lt;code>include Module&lt;/code> but in any event, when extending a class with a module what ended up working based on the new design was to call &lt;code>self.extend LegalToMarkdown::Module&lt;/code> from a method in the class which parses the conditions to determine the correct modules to integrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The portion of the code dealing with mixins was integrated into its own Module under the LegalToMarkdown module. Similarly the methods which parse leaders (structured headers) has been put into a different module under the LegalToMarkdown module. The last module I built deals with some particularities required for the &lt;code>--to-json&lt;/code> feature. So at the end of the day, the structure of the gem currently looks like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>module LegalMarkdown&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt; module LegalToMarkdown&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt; -&amp;gt; class FileToParse&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt; module Mixin&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt; module Leaders&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt; module BuildJason&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-&amp;gt; module MakeYAMLFrontmatter&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Again, feedback on the structure is very much welcome as I'm still learning how to think about software design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="testing-suite">Testing Suite&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I know, I know. You are supposed to have tests for what you do. How else will you know if it is working or not? I'm still learning! In any event, I took some time to build a testing suite. It was actually quite easy. And it greatly simplifies the development process. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://github.com/twolfson">@twolfson&lt;/a> posted an issue on the github repo which sent me in the correct direction. He said I should build a bunch of simple flat files that represent the input and expected output. This is more or less what I had been doing, although I was not doing it systematically and was just doing it chaotically. Everything I read said that I should start out with testing using Ruby's included test suite rather than RSpec or other more intricate, and capable, test possibilities. So that is currently the basis for the suite. Later, when I'm more comfortable with the process I may switch to RSpec but for now Test::Unit is working just fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the things that was important with a process oriented gem like legal_markdown is that when I test things there is a certain sequence in which I want the tests to run. So when I built the lmd files I simply numbered them. Then in the test controller I can simply glob the files, sort the resulting array and then it will always run the tests in a particular order that I want the files to be parsed. This allows me to check the operation of the gem in a particular sequence. That assists in understanding exactly where the problems. After building the lmd files then I ran those through the gem and tweaked a few things in the output markdown files (mostly which were bugs that I needed to work on). Boom, I had a working test suite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The basic philosophy for testing is to build these benchmark files. Then the test suite pulls the lmd files, puts them in order, then runs them one by one through the gem and outputs a temp file. Lastly, the test suite compares the temp file output to the benchmark file to ensure they are the same. Later when I add additional functionality or need to test different things, I can simply build a single lmd file that tests for what I need, output that to a md file as a benchmark, number it in the correct order in which I want the test to run and everything else will be taken care of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I had the test suite built. Then I had to work on the Rakefile to build the testing task. I integrated the github repo with &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis&lt;/a> so that it will perform the tests for me on different versions of ruby. Generally I can test the gem quite quickly in 1.9.3 which is primarily what I use for development on my laptop. I run these tests after each piece of code after each piece of code that I've changed during the deeper refactor (below). The advantage of Travis is that it will run the tests on other versions of Ruby very quickly. But to use Travis, and to make running the tests more simple on my machine, I needed to build a rake task that would control the tests. It was very easy after a bit of googling and stack overflowing I had the answer within five minutes. I need to understand how to use rake better, but one thing at a time. For now, here's what the Rakefile looks like:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is very rudimentary for most, but it was cool for me to be able to type &lt;code>rake&lt;/code> into the command line (or if I was feeling verbose &lt;code>bundle exec rake&lt;/code>) and have it run the tests. Plus now Travis runs all the tests on the versions of Ruby which I specify in the .travis.yml file.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="deeper-refactoring">Deeper Refactoring&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Along with Travis, I also integrated the repo with &lt;a href="https://codeclimate.com">Code Climate&lt;/a>. Both of these tools are free for open source projects and make their money (as Github does) by providing the same, or similar, services for closed source project. I absolutely love this business model. Code Climate looks at your code and analyzes the complexity and redundancy of the code basis. Digging into its analysis of my code basis is teaching me a lot about coding and how to think about coding. For anyone that is reaching the advanced beginner stage of learning to code this is a fantastic tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I first integrated with Code Climate it gave me a rounding &amp;ldquo;F&amp;rdquo; and my GPA was 0.2. This was eye opening. It was one of the impetuses for my major refactor discussed above. After I parsed everything out into modules, etc. I also had to take a look at the methods and simplify those. Previously I had been thinking of methods as a way to control the flow of the code. So each of logical steps and substeps of the code were built as methods. It worked. But it is suboptimal for reasons I'm still learning. The basic jist is that I needed to greatly simplify what I was doing with my methods. So, mainly in the Leaders module I worked hard to refactor the code so that each method was more simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, though, the code base is quite complex. I'm up to a GPA of 1.5 but I have a decent amount of work to do. Some of the complexity it appears to me is inevitable. There are a ton of complexities in what the gem is trying to do. There are ton of switches and branches depending on what the input is. In order to provide the functionality that I want, I'm still trying to figure out how to simplify the code base as much as possible. There appears a tension in what I'm trying to accomplish with the gem and the complexity of the codebase. However, this is hardly the most complex piece of code ever written. Much to learn; much to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="to-json-feature">To Json Feature&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some background. I started building legal_markdown because I wanted it to be a simple tool that could provide a basis for a new way of thinking about and creating legal documents. Yet, how to integrate with a ruby gem for non-technical, non-command line users, was a big concern. The average lawyer likely has never looked at the command line. Or at least, not since 1986. So it is fine that I have built in a command line option, but that is only the beginning. The next step was to integrate the gem into a sublime package. I use this package on a daily basis and it makes using the gem dead simple. Users can install sublime, install Package control, install the legal markdown package and go. Still there is the ruby requirement, but at least that is a surmountable obstacle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with working with lmd files in sublime is primarily that it is not a very elegant solution for reading and annotating documents. Currently if I want to read a lmd file, it is damn easy. I simply run the Legal Markdown to Markdown command in sublime and then run the Preview Markdown command from the Markdown Preview package and it opens automatically in the browser. Two commands. It is not bad, but it could be better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are some of the concerns behind &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/rmoc">RMOC&lt;/a>. To read and annotate files will require a more complex structure than simple markdown is capable of providing. There are a couple of options for richer file formats than simple text based format such as markdown. For now, the primary &amp;ldquo;rich&amp;rdquo; format that legal_markdown will support is JSON. As I stated in this &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown/issues/2">issue&lt;/a> , JSON is readily available for all major programming/scripting languages; generally parses faster and is easier to work with than xml (the other major option); and also integrates with databases very well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, I've been a fan for a while of what the team building &lt;a href="http://substance.io">Substance&lt;/a> is doing. So, I've built the to-json feature of legal_markdown so that it outputs in a format which will fully integrate with Substance. Then when I build the Read component of RMOC I can simply use a lot of their code to build the reading and annotating portion of RMOC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Building the feature was not really troublesome. Once you have a good idea of how to work with hashes in ruby then it is really a simple matter to build JSON documents. You simply assemble the code into one large hash and then dump that hash into a JSON.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Classes = things. Files are things. A file is a Class. Functionality goes in modules&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modules are ways to keep blocks of code so that they can be integrated when necessary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Methods should have a singular function&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Nested hashes area bit troublesome when the keys are id's and you only know the values rather than the keys. Have to loop through each_value and work the search that way. Also, Enumerable::detect is good for this.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don't be afraid of tests. They aren't that complex.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As part of my work for &lt;a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu">Vanderbilt Law School&lt;/a>&amp;lsquo;s &lt;a href="http://law.vanderbilt.edu/academics/academic-programs/international-legal-studies/index.aspx">International Legal Studies Program&lt;/a> I recently pushed a grant application to a US Government Agency that was all about increasing the capacity of an institution to perform its mandated functionality. It was a relatively straight-forward submission &amp;ndash; the safest I've been involved in lately as it had the least amount of innovation I have built into a submission in years. For these reasons, I feel we have a relatively high chance of success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The part I like least when it comes to developing grant applications is the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) portion of the grant response. It is not because I feel that M&amp;amp;E is worthless. Indeed, the contrary is true. I fully buy into the notion that development programs must &lt;em>monitor&lt;/em> their implementation based on measurable metrics. Further, I fully buy into the idea that development programming is simply a means that is an attempt to achieve some (other) identifiable end and I fully buy into the idea that we should develop a theory for how the programming will lead to the desired results portfolio and we should &lt;em>evaluate&lt;/em> the project based on those outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite intellectually understanding the need for and efficacy of M&amp;amp;E, I detest writing M&amp;amp;E frameworks. Mostly, I suspect this is due to the sector I work in. If I worked in education, health, agriculture, or some other sectors of the development world perhaps M&amp;amp;E would be less of a motivational hurdle for me; perhaps not, to be honest I have no idea. There are two reasons why I think this could be true. First, these sectors can more easily be measured. Second, these sectors present programs with a quicker ROI where success or failure of the program can more easily be measured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we can all agree that the ability to measure success is one of the more important elements to the design of any M&amp;amp;E framework, then we need to (as practitioners) build M&amp;amp;E frameworks that can be measured. Duh. Yet, if the goal is to &amp;ldquo;build institution X&amp;rdquo; or to &amp;ldquo;build the capacity of policymakers within area Y&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;provide technical support to the reform of policy sector Z&amp;rdquo; how can we craft metrics which are easily measured? Governance work (which I am referring to in isolation from democracy &amp;amp; governance work) usually boils down to one of those three goals. Either the donor and the beneficiary government want an institution to be built, want the capacity of the individuals comprising an institution to be bolstered, or want to achieve a longer-term legal or policy reform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we look at measuring the implementation and the success of any development programming (I'm not a fan of the intervention jargon with respect to governance work), there are basically two ways in which we can measure things. We can measure &lt;em>what has been done&lt;/em>. These are commonly called &lt;strong>output variables&lt;/strong>. Examples of output measurement: How many memos were written and given to policymakers? How many schools were built? How many police units were outfitted with advanced investigation kit? Output variables commonly measure things that are usually well within the control of the implementing agency or consortium. We can also measure &lt;em>what has happened&lt;/em>. These are commonly called &lt;strong>outcome variables&lt;/strong>. Examples of outcome measurement: How much better is the institution performing? How many more students are graduating from the impact area? How many few crimes were committed within the impact area? Outcome variables commonly measure things that are not so easily within the control of the implementing agency or consortium.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between the two (output and outcome) it is more beneficial to the implementing agency or consortium to measure the outputs. The implementer can more easily control the output as the delivery of the output is usually well within the decision space of the implementer. It is self-evident that no implementer wants to show that they did not deliver on a project when the delivery on that project was a result of things outside their control. Most humans would find it within the realm of normality to have their performance evaluated based upon what they actually did. Output variables are simply a measurement of what the implementer has done, and therefore easier to measure and also easier to say, &amp;ldquo;evaluate me on &lt;em>this&lt;/em>.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between the two (output and outcome), however, it is more beneficial to the environment in which the program is being implemented to measure the outcomes. Outcome variables are a method which more precisely measures the &lt;strong>results&lt;/strong> of the program that was implemented. The overarching mission of what we, as development workers, should be doing is to produce results that positively affect the environment. While purchasing advanced investigation kit for police units and training personnel on that kit's usage is important that is not necessarily a result (it is an output). That purchase and training effort will not, of itself, positively affect the environment. However, if the police are empowered to use the kit and training to reduce crime within the impact area, then we are looking at a result that positively affects the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While they may be more beneficial to build into M&amp;amp;E frameworks, it is often not a simple matter to measure outcomes &amp;ndash; particularly when we are talking about building and/or reforming institutions. The real problem that I often face when I am trying to think through building an M&amp;amp;E framework is the same reason why, psychologically, governance work can be wholly unsatisfying for those who dedicate their professional lives to it. I am sure that social scientists and development thinkers with more brains and experience than I have some lingo for it, but I just call it the &amp;ldquo;gratification delay.&amp;rdquo; When the effort you are embarking upon is about transmitting knowledge, it will take time for you to see the results of that effort. This is self-evident and we all see it in our every day lives. If we are talking about building an institution we are talking about transmitting knowledge in how to run that institution much more than we are talking about building some physical structure, and so we are facing a situation where the real gratification for the effort cannot be measured until some non-specific time in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gets me to the biggest problem I have with the evaluation portion of any M&amp;amp;E framework. It is not that it is difficult to build the framework, it is that is exceptionally short sited of donors to require implementing agencies to evaluate the project within the timeframe of the project. So in other words it is simply a paper tiger. It wreaks to me of work for work's sake, rather than work that will end with the satisfaction of some logical goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For my own purposes, I would love if a donor said that I should submit a grant application and build an M&amp;amp;E framework into that submission but that my &amp;amp;E portion will be conducted by another organization at some reasonable time following the conclusion of the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost every project that I have seen or been a part of is behind from the beginning and is rushing towards the end to deliver on its promises. Even where those projects have built the final quarter of the project as M&amp;amp;E time to properly evaluate the project, the best they can do within that timeframe is simply to get a very early picture of the results. So why do donors not simply extend out the &amp;amp;E part to four, six, eight quarters following the completion of the project? I am sure there are reasons, but I surely do not know what they are.&lt;/p>

Lexie is my friends&amp;rsquo; daughter and she is lovely. She had to do a Flat Stanley project but she named it Flat Lexie instead. So they sent me a Flat Lexie and we basically travelled the world together &amp;ndash; flat lexie and I. We had a few adventures so I wanted to try to capture the pictures I took but also to capture the geography and background of the different places. Indeed, this is supposed to be the point of the Flat Stanley/Flat Lexie exercises for kids to know about the world. In any event, &lt;a href="http://flatlexie.caseykuhlman.com">here&lt;/a> is the result; &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/flat-lexie">here&lt;/a> is the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a simple Sinatra app (first for me), running on Heroku (another first for me), which integrates the &lt;a href="https://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps">gMaps&lt;/a> package I installed with Bower (first, first), and a bit of jQuery I added along the way to tie everything together (not a first).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What did I learn?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I like Ruby.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I'm not sure I like javascript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>At a minimum, I'm pretty awful at javascript.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In any event I'm more comfortable with Ruby.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sinatra is smooth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heroku is smooth.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I still have to figure out how to pass JSON data to javascript run views from Ruby controllers that doesn't rely on data attributes &amp;ndash; as that feels like such a patch.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how">How&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The chunk that took me the biggest portion of time was building the javascript file that would tie gMaps, jQuery and the view together. I built the view so it would preload all of the images in boxes that I wanted to slideToggle the display of in sequence. This was straight-forward jQuery, nothing special there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I wanted the map which comprises a 100%x100% background to move around zoom in and zoom out on certain events. Basically I wanted the map to start zoomed out, so that Lexie could see the context, and then after waiting a few seconds I wanted to zoom in to the pinpoint location. When moving to the next picture in the series I wanted the sequence to run like this: slideToggle the old picture/entry, I wanted the map to zoom out to a preestablished zoom level (which depended on how &amp;ldquo;big&amp;rdquo; the transition was), then I wanted to put a marker in the new location, then I wanted the map to slide its center over to the new location. It turned out to be not that difficult. gMaps is a great API wrapper for Google Maps API. Between gMaps and jQuery it wasn't that difficult to craft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still I have some issues with javascript. My issues aren't with javascript per se, as in they are the language's problem, they are my problem in that I don't really know how to use the language properly yet. I still don't fully understand how to call functions and functions as extensable objects is still quite confusing to me and also variable scope is killing me. Both of these Ruby is much more straight-forward about (or else I've read more about and understand better). So if anyone wants to point out the innumerable flaws and less than optimal code in the javascript below I'm happy to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any event, my script that tied the whole thing together and made Flat Lexie works.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the record, Flat Lexie can easily be adopted to your needs if you have a Flat Stanley project to do. Just fork the repo, add your pictures, add the datapoints.json lat/longs, write any copy you may want and &lt;code>git push heroku&lt;/code>. Voila.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking everyone!&lt;/p>

The package is built to fill a couple of holes in the system that I use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As background, I use Sublime as my main IDE both for coding and for my legal work. I use a word processor, but only to review client documents and to do a final review on documents that I build. All the documents that build, I do so in Sublime. I write regular memos in regular markdown and pandoc them to ODT, double check the formating and output to PDF (and docx if the client needs it) using Libre's &lt;a href="http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/multisave-1">multiformat save extension&lt;/a>. I draft laws, regulations, contracts, and corporate governance documents in &lt;code>lmd&lt;/code> format, use legal_markdown package to push them (interstitially to normal markdown and then via pandoc) to ODT.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system worked fine, but I did have to pull down my &lt;a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2013/03/terra-terminal-update-brings-improved.html">Terra terminal&lt;/a>, cd to the proper directory and run the pandoc command &amp;ndash; after converting the &lt;code>lmd&lt;/code> file in Sublime to normal markdown. So I knew I wanted to combine some of the better aspects of the various pandoc - sublime integrations (there are at least three that I know of) with the legal_markdown preprocessing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've now pushed the result. One of the differences in my implementation of pandoc integration (beyond the preprocessing by the legal_markdown gem obviously) is to utilize a document type definitional system. Basically, I wanted to be able to define different output document types and to pre-establish all of the pandoc options for these in my user settings file for the package. Then, when I wanted to export the &lt;code>lmd&lt;/code> file I just wanted a quick panel to show up where I could choose the export document type and let the package and pandoc take care of adding the correct mix of settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it works fine. Basically in the user settings, you add &amp;ldquo;build-format&amp;rdquo; keys and for each key you add a document type name (what will show up in the quick panel) key. Then inside this key you add whatever pandoc options you want. There are four main options that the package will use: &amp;ldquo;from&amp;rdquo; (pandoc's reader options), &amp;ldquo;to&amp;rdquo; (pandoc's writer options), &amp;ldquo;file-output&amp;rdquo; (triggers pandoc's -o flag), and &amp;ldquo;options&amp;rdquo; (which you can use for general options such as &amp;ndash;normalize -S flags which are technically writer options but I think of them as general options). Each of the fields (except for the &amp;ldquo;file-output&amp;rdquo; field) should be an array. The &amp;ldquo;file-output&amp;rdquo; field should be either &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; or deleted. If it is deleted then the package will replace the currently active buffer with pandoc's output. Usually, for this package's purpose you will almost always want to have it asa true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lastly, I wanted the package to automatically open a file for me. In other words when I'm converting a &lt;code>lmd&lt;/code> file to &lt;code>odt&lt;/code> I want to switch over to libreoffice to review the file. So the package also adds an optional field to each document type called &amp;ldquo;open-file-after-build&amp;rdquo;. This field is a simple command that you will call to open the file. The package will fill in the file that is outputted by pandoc after the command. So you &lt;strong>do not&lt;/strong> need to type &amp;ldquo;libreoffice $FILE&amp;rdquo; into the settings file, you simply need to type &amp;ldquo;libreoffice&amp;rdquo; into the settings file and the package will take care of the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have not tested the auto open in OSX or Windows so if anyone else has those boxes and can test it, that would be fantastic. I'm happy to work to make it cross platform compatible as much as I can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still have a bit more work to go on the package as you can see from the roadmap but it is now one step closer to where I'd like it to be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

A really great system, actually. Especially for non-technical users. It also requires a huge amount of overhead for what most people use it for. Also, it is not nearly as fast and reliable as I would like it to be. So I decided that my blog needed to move from Wordpress to Jekyll. I had been using the same blog theme for about four years now so I also wanted to refactor that. Here's what I did to migrate it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-1-install-ben-balters-migrate-to-jekyll-plugin">Step 1: Install Ben Balter's Migrate to Jekyll Plugin&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First, I downloaded Ben's migrate &lt;a href="https://github.com/benbalter/wordpress-to-jekyll-exporter">plugin&lt;/a> for Wordpress. Then I unzipped that into my plugins directory in my Wordpress install (which I deploy from my workstation using git), enable the plugin and click Tools -&amp;gt; Export to Jekyll. Then the server will chew on it for a while and spit out a decent zip. The zip file has the templates (which I didn't use as I was rebuilding them from scratch and didn't care what the old ones looked like), the posts, and the pages you have on your blog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were a few annoyances with the output, though. These annoyances are not any problem with the Exporter which worked as I expected it would. They were mainly annoyances with a lot of rust that is within the code/database of my blog. That rust was one of the main reasons that I wanted to switch to Jekyll. Since Jekyll is simply plain text files it is much simpler to iterate over the files and make the changes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-2-build-the-jekyll-deploy-how-i-wanted-it-to-look">Step 2: Build the Jekyll Deploy How I Wanted it to Look&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Next, I worked on the layouts, includes, html files, config, rakefile and put everything how I wanted it to be. This was simple web design and there are lots of tutorials which were quite helpful in this endeavour. Once the Jekyll deployment looked and acted how I wanted it to, it was time to chew on the files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="step-3-build-a-ruby-script-to-reformulate-the-posts-how-i-wanted">Step 3: Build a Ruby Script to Reformulate the Posts How I Wanted&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first problem that I had with the export was that the yaml frontmatter was loaded with a lot of crap that I neither needed nor wanted for the Jekyll. So I thought I would build a small ruby script that would clean the YAML Frontmatter. Here's the part of the script that does that.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"> &lt;span style="color:#66d9ef">def&lt;/span> &lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#f92672">&lt;/span>&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e">clean_the_yaml&lt;/span>( yaml_block, first_para )

&lt;p>That prt of the script mainly strips out the old rust from the YAML front matter and ensures that all my punctuation will not get in the way of Jekyll doing its job. For instance, I had lots of colons in my titles and these are a problem with YAML if you do not escape them or put the string in double quotes. Also I wanted all the posts to have some sort of a excerpt so if I did not have an excerpt in the Wordpress, I built the script to import the first paragraph and then escaped it and guarded against problems with punctuation in the paragraphh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second thing I had to overcome was the way the exporter handled images embedded in the text was not really how I wanted it. I am not sure if the exporter was made to export images or not, but I think because I run a multisite deployment &amp;ndash; and because Wordpress handles multisite files much differently than single site files &amp;ndash; that the images were a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I looked on my machine in the Blogs.dir for the Blog I was exporting I saw another problem which was that Wordpress saves a lot of different versions of the same file. This was going to be a problem when I tried to import the photos into the Jekyll asset pipeline I built.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was used to the ruby &lt;code>system&lt;/code> command but there was a problem when I tried to drop the return of the system command into a variable. And then I came upon my new favorite rubyism: backticks. These were great. They work just like backticks in bash/zsh scripting so they were quite intuitive. They run a system command and throw the result of that into a string variable &amp;ndash; which you can split, strip, do whatever you need. This let me build a &lt;code>find&lt;/code> command that I could use to get over the multiple files issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also needed to reformulate &lt;em>how&lt;/em> the images were called within the text. Wordpress puts a caption (which I almost always used) and the exporter used the reference link syntax that I don't particularly prefer in markdown. So I wanted to reform that part of the source posts. Here's the part of the script that did that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After I built the script and tested it on a few of the more recent posts I needed to run it on the entire directory of posts. I kept the posts in a separate directory out of the repo so if anything got screwed up with the script I could just re run it. I ended up having to do that a couple of times as I had to tweak my original version of the script a bit to arrive at what is presented above.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>rm -rf _posts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cp ~/Downloads/jekyll-export/_posts . -R &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git add _posts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./cleaner.rb
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>One of the first things I realized was that I needed to add the &lt;code>_posts&lt;/code> dir to the the repo again as when you run jekyll it will &lt;code>git ls-files&lt;/code>. So I ran the above command until I was happy with the results and then I finally ran this command.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>rm -rf _posts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; cp ~/Downloads/jekyll-export/_posts . -R &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git add _posts &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ./cleaner.rb &amp;amp;&amp;amp; rake site:publish
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>That was it! The full cleaner script can be found in &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/compleatang/5401492">this gist&lt;/a>. If you want to use it, download it into the root of Jekyll, &lt;code>chmod +x cleaner.rb&lt;/code> and you will be all set.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned.&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Testing of scripts is huge. I still don't really know how to do this but I tested it with sample data and was prepared for things to go wrong.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Backticks. FTW.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

I mainly use Gnome Shell as my desktop environment, but since I use Ubuntu I keep Unity on my machine. I'm not a hater of Unity or Gnome as many Linux users (who can be quite vitriolic in their statements as to desktop environments). I &lt;em>mostly&lt;/em> use Gnome, but since Ubuntu has some interesting things going on with Unity sometimes I like to drop into Unity to see what I'm missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a problem at least in Ubuntu 12.10 running both desktops. To use Gnome Shell one &lt;em>should&lt;/em> install the &lt;code>gdm&lt;/code> package in order to get the full Gnome desktop experience - including the Gnome lock screen which is beautiful. GDM stands for Gnome Desktop Manager. It is an alternative to &lt;code>lightdm&lt;/code> which Ubuntu installs by default and which Unity uses. When you switch to gdm I found out that just after installing it you should logout of Unity before restarting your machine. But I didn't do that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result of installing gdm and then restarting your machine is that the X server (which runs most of the linux desktops and lies in the stack underneath both gdm and lightdm) doesn't start correctly for &amp;ldquo;both&amp;rdquo; Unity and Shell. It is something to do with the way that dm loads the XSessions and it is beyond my understanding. In any event the problem for me was that while gdm made Shell work as it should out of the box, Unity would not load when I logged into Unity desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I built a small autostart script that for Unity that will load Unity after logging into the Ubuntu desktop. This was straight-forward. But the problem I had is that I didn't want the script to try to load Unity when I logged into Gnome. But, as usual with linux, with a bit of Googling I came across the key. In X session desktop scripts (which are the main way to start/run programs) you can define which desktop environment they should show up in. This means that when you put the script into the autostart folder (~/.config/autostart) you can mark the script to &amp;hellip; &lt;code>OnlyShowIn=GNOME;&lt;/code> or &lt;code>OnlyShowIn=UNITY;&lt;/code> or &lt;code>NotShowIn=GNOME;&lt;/code> or &lt;code>NotShowIn=UNITY;&lt;/code>. You can add multiple environments for the desktop script to be shown or hidden in after the semicolons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is helpful for showing or hiding certain programs/scripts in your menus in different desktop environments but also when you put it in the scripts in your autostart folder you can tell linux to only load the programs when you log into certain desktop environments. I tested the script and it didn't work at first. The problem was because gdm wasn't loading Unity, the autoload scripts I marked to only load in Unity weren't triggering. Even though gdm sent me to Unity, the desktop environment wasn't loading correctly. So I had to change the script from &lt;code>OnlyShowIn=UNITY;&lt;/code> to &lt;code>NotShowIn=GNOME;&lt;/code>. This meant that when the desktop environment saw that it was not in Shell it triggered the script for Unity. It isn't ideal as the autoload scripts that are linked to Unity don't run &lt;em>after&lt;/em> the Unity reload script runs, but it is a decent enough work around for the amount that I use Unity (minimal).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very powerful as you usually want Gnome Shell and Unity to load the different sugar packages such as applets, indicators, etc., that help you define the environment you are working in. This is reason 7 million why Linux is awesome. In any event, here's the script I use to reload the Unity desktop after I log into Unity.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span style="color:#f92672">[&lt;/span>Desktop Entry&lt;span style="color:#f92672">]&lt;/span>
Type&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>Application
Exec&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>unity
Hidden&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>false
NoDisplay&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>false

NotShowIn&lt;span style="color:#f92672">=&lt;/span>GNOME;&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I saved that in ~/.config/autostart and voila all (mostly) working as it should.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Hacking!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On a day, of which the tenth anniversary is fast approaching, I was standing on a roundabout watching a bunch of people I knew and a machine I was familiar with rip down a statute. It was a day seared into my memory as I was thoroughly convinced that I was in the midst of an iconic moment. In some ways that belief was correct. Only it was just not the type of icon I was thinking it would be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="baghdad-early-2003">Baghdad, Early, 2003&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I wrote a book, and sold it based upon simply being present on that day in that locattion. I’ve been asked to give interviews (generally all around March or April of each year) not because I have anything particularly insightful to say about the invasion of Iraq, but merely because I was there. Present. Around. As the color of that day slowly desaturates in a process which only time understands and can justify, I have been reflecting not upon a machine, a chain, and a bronze statute. Instead, I’ve been reflecting upon something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At some point in the day, I and some friends were asked to give an interview. This was an exciting opportunity for the 26 year old version of the version of me currently typing this. It was exciting for two reasons in particular. First, I knew that there was a decent chance that word of the interview would float through the social networks of the time to my family. I thought someone somewhere will see this and let someone know and thereon until (hopefully) my family get some word that everything was OK. Second, I was excited about the interview because it was with ABC News. This was the outlet I used to watch as a growing child, a nightly voice, iconography, and color scheme that I knew well. I, along with some other friends, was going to be interviewed by Peter Jennings. And that dude’s a legend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the interview, I’m pretty sure that I really only had one line. Too nervous (and star struck perhaps) to say much else. But I did get in a line. Later my mother told me that while she recognized my face during the first part of the interview, she only really &lt;em>knew&lt;/em> it was me when she saw the sarcasm drip from my mouth. The irony is that, for once in my life, I actually wasn’t trying to be sarcastic. Peter asked the group of three or four of us that were gathered on the balcony of the Palestine Hotel if we felt safer now that we were in Baghdad. It was, frankly, a stupid question to ask a group of Marines from an infantry battalion laden with weapons and youthful egos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend Jack, who eventually became my co-author, gave the answer that you are supposed to give in such situations. He said that it did not matter, that our guard was up and we were fully prepared for anything that may come — whether that was a chicken dinner or a bunch of bullets — and that we were ready and capable of responding appropriately. During the days that followed, in the chaos that was the early days of post-invasion Baghdad, we would have to face both of those scenarios, and many more, sometimes at the same moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The war junky reporter on the ground pointed the mic at me, and (at least as I remember it) I simply asked one question: “Do &lt;em>you&lt;/em> feel safer now that we are here?”&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="twenty-nine-palms-ca-late-2002">Twenty-Nine Palms, CA, Late, 2002&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the run up to the war I did not allow any part of my brain to engage in an intellectual discourse with any other part of my brain as to the rightness or wrongness of the job any idiot could see was coming for us. I had a job to do, and I was damn determined to be good at that job. Or at least, to try my best to be good at it. I was worried that if I allowed the self-felating ethical discourse to overtake and supplant my thinking that I would not be as fast, as precise, as &lt;em>on&lt;/em> as I needed to be in order to actually accomplish the job that was coming for me. Perhaps, upon reflection from the perspective of ten years, that was the incorrect decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps it was the correct decision. Either way, it would not have mattered. I did not meet the religious pre-affiliation rules in order to actually be a conscientious objector and therefore it was going to be an offense that would lead me to a court martial if I did not do my best to accomplish my job. And when I’m brutally honest with myself, I was excited about it. I wanted to go. Because when you go into the Marines, especially into an infantry battalion, if you don’t go to war it is basically just masturbation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this time, before we deployed to Kuwait, my friend Faith forwarded an email detailing the time and location of upcoming anti-war demonstrations in New Orleans where she was living at the time. To my …@usmc.mil email address. When I first got the email I smiled. I was pleased that anti-war demonstrations were happening. In some ways it made it easier to accept my own, conscious, lack of any ethical discourse within myself. But to my work email address? I saw that it was just to a bunch of people, as many forwarded emails were in the times before facebook. So I didn’t really blame her. Yet, I did respond to the email. Although I don’t fully remember what I wrote, I think it was something along the lines of “Thanks for the email. I fully support your right to do that. Just don’t send any such emails to my work account!”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do remember thinking at one point after I replied (in probably an overly cold way) that that was their job and I had my job and our jobs were different. Then I simply put it out of my mind and went about preparing what needed to be prepared.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hargeisa-somaliland-early-2013">Hargeisa, Somaliland, Early, 2013&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My reply to Peter Jennings was not meant as sarcasm. My reply was meant honestly. Although my voice, combined with my love of sarcasm, led most to believe I meant it sarcastically. After the intensity of the now that was then has dissipated and we Americans are forced to live with the choices of the leaders we chose, and the knowledge that many Iraqis are also forced to live with the choices of the leaders they did not choose, I will ask it again. “Do you feel safer now that we are here?”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will stop at this point and say one thing. If someone wants to put some faux comment on this post saying, “thank you for your service” I will delete it. I absolutely abhor those comments. They ring hollow to me and mean absolutely nothing. I did not really serve. I did a job. Sure those that entered the armed forces after 9/11 knew, in a way that I had no idea of when I signed on the line, or, at a minimum, they had some idea of, what they were getting into. Perhaps they “served” in the sense that word is often used. But I did not. I simply did a job. A job that I was contractually obliged to do. And, perhaps, wanted to do. But either way, it was a job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet there’s another, more important, reason that I abhor that phrase.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="champaign-illinois-late-1999">Champaign, Illinois, Late, 1999&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We had a tradition in our Naval Reserve Officer’s Training Corp (ROTC) group that on the last Thursday before anyone graduated they had an opportunity to take the floor. Most used it as a way to proffer vapid “advice” on matters of which they knew not or to provide idiotic thank yous to people they would never see again and perhaps neither liked nor respected. That all seemed quite stupid to my 23 year old self. When my turn came, after some of my best and greatest friends had their chance to say what they felt appropriate to say, I stood up and recited the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>John Brown went off to war to fight on a foreign shore
His mama sure was proud of him!
He stood straight and tall in his uniform and all
His mama’s face broke out all in a grin&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh son, you look so fine, I’m glad you’re a son of mine
You make me proud to know you hold a gun
Do what the captain says, lots of medals you will get
And we’ll put them on the wall when you come home”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As that old train pulled out, John’s ma began to shout
Tellin’ ev’ryone in the neighborhood:
“That’s my son that’s about to go, he’s a soldier now, you know”
She made well sure her neighbors understood&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She got a letter once in a while and her face broke into a smile
As she showed them to the people from next door
And she bragged about her son with his uniform and gun
And these things you called a good old-fashioned war&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh! Good old-fashioned war!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the letters ceased to come, for a long time they did not come
They ceased to come for about ten months or more
Then a letter finally came saying, “Go down and meet the train
Your son’s a-coming home from the war”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She smiled and went right down, she looked everywhere around
But she could not see her soldier son in sight
But as all the people passed, she saw her son at last
When she did she could hardly believe her eyes&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh his face was all shot up and his hand was all blown off
And he wore a metal brace around his waist
He whispered kind of slow, in a voice she did not know
While she couldn’t even recognize his face!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh! Lord! Not even recognize his face&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh tell me, my darling son, pray tell me what they done
How is it you come to be this way?”
He tried his best to talk but his mouth could hardly move
And the mother had to turn her face away&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Don’t you remember, Ma, when I went off to war
You thought it was the best thing I could do?
I was on the battleground, you were home . . . acting proud
You wasn’t there standing in my shoes”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Oh, and I thought when I was there, God, what am I doing here?
I’m a-tryin’ to kill somebody or die tryin’
But the thing that scared me most was when my enemy came close
And I saw that his face looked just like mine”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh! Lord! Just like mine!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And I couldn’t help but think, through the thunder rolling and stink
That I was just a puppet in a play
And through the roar and smoke, this string is finally broke
And a cannonball blew my eyes away”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As he turned away to walk, his Ma was still in shock
At seein’ the metal brace that helped him stand
But as he turned to go, he called his mother close
And he dropped his medals down into her hand&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~ John Brown by Bob Dylan (lyrics available &lt;a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/john-brown#ixzz2O6Kzjo5a" title="Bob Dylan - John Brown">here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Here I was, 23. Mere days from beginning The Basic School, which is where all Marine Officers begin their journey. Reciting the lyrics of a poet famously known for his anti-war positions to a bunch of people who were only months away from beginning their journeys in the military. But I had a point. A point I still believe deeply in. A point I never explained, as when I finished reciting the poetry that is Dylan’s song I simply walked out of the room (or just sat down, can’t remember exactly).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fourteen years later, let me get to the point. If you are going to do this thing called the military. Called war. Know what the hell you are getting yourself into.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did not mean don’t do war, and there is nothing within the song (even from my now quite adamant anti-war position) that is actually overtly anti-war. The real message of the song is that those that cheerlead for war without understanding the consequences of what they are saying do a great disservice to those that actually do go to war. Those that go to war, that enter the military, are forced to struggle with what this means to each. This thing we call war. Of course what it means, being an existential question, will differ from person to person. The point is not the answer arrived at by any individual, the point is that the individual took that journey. Dylan was not saying that those people who embark upon this journey and exit it with some conclusion are bad. He was not saying that war was bad or good, right or wrong, or any other other banal symbols lazy people use when they do not want to struggle with a difficult question. What Dylan was saying is that those who cheerlead from the sidelines but do not embark upon this journey themselves — with honesty and self-reflection — are more harming to society than those that hold the guns and fire the rounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hargeisa-somaliland-early-2013-1">Hargeisa, Somaliland, Early, 2013&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And this is how I find &lt;em>most&lt;/em> of the “thanks for your service”. So let me say it more clearly. Just because Fox News, whose editorial board learned from the heartbreaking stories of Vietnam veterans (who often had no choice whether to go and who often acted in the best way they knew in some crazy situations) returning home to be spat upon, tells people that it is somehow patriotic to thank veterans for their service does not mean that it actually is. Am I saying that it is &lt;em>bad&lt;/em> to say that, or that others will not fully appreciate if one were to say the same phrase to them? Not in the slightest. But I am saying that, to me, the phrase is mostly a vapid self-justification more beneficial to the speaker than to the spoken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Do you feel safer now?” I meant it when I said it. And I mean it now. It is easy for us that feel the Iraq War was a shameful enterprise to embark upon to blame Bush and Cheney for entering a war unilaterally, without justification that has cost over 4,400 American lives, cost probably a hundred times that in Iraqi lives, brought innumerable wounds, severed innumerable families, and cost over $3T (money which would have solved world hunger twice over by many estimates). In my mind that is not the question. Sure Bush and Cheney were power hungry, manipulative, and greedy. You don’t become President of the United States by being humble. We Americans, we reward the greedy, hungry, manipulative people in business, in politics, in celebrity culture. We have done it for years and there is no abatement in sight. In fact the “American Dream” is simply a less egregious version of this. In other words, we have built it into our Nation’s DNA. While I have problems, big problems, with their legal justification for entering the war and I am wary that we have set a precedent within international law that does not progress us humans down the road of tolerance and dialogue, I don’t blame them any more than I blame America as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last few days I’ve seen an onslaught of &lt;em>mea culpas&lt;/em> from media elite saying, why didn’t we do our job as the media? That’s fine. They should feel guilt as they committed gross malpractice. But there was plenty of commentary available, even in those days before social media (did the world exist before social media?), to those that wanted to find it. Hell, I knew it was around and I was actively trying to avoid it. So, if I’m honest with myself they certainly played their part, but I don’t blame them any more than I blame America as a whole.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I meant when I asked Peter Jennings, and his many American viewers, that question is this. I am doing my job. A job that collectively, you citizens, you media, and you the leaders we all elected collectively, have sent me to do. My own personal views as to my safety is 100% beside the point. I am a Marine. My job is to stand between danger and Americans. I am trying my best to do this. But you, the American people must ask yourself, do YOU feel safer? I’ve done my part, my job. Did you do yours?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Who do I blame the most, if blame is to be apportioned at all? I blame the cheerleaders. All of them. From the bureaucracy to the media to the businessmen licking their chops at the chance to exploit defense budgets to the average citizens putting up yellow ribbons and in their hearts pleased that their son/daughter/brother/sister/friend was “doing their part.” I blame the cheerleaders for not learning from the demonstrators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the next time you simply take a politician at their word without a thoughtful examination of what you actually think on the matter, the next time you choose to rename “french fries” to “freedom fries” because the French polity had the gall to challenge their leaders and to demand a continuation of the, admittedly cold, peace. In these times, ask yourself: “Do I feel safer now?”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the first meeting, I will try to ferret out what the client is trying to achieve. This is generally an overview meeting. Mostly, Somalis do not like doing too much in any one meeting &amp;ndash; especially if they do not know you well. So I try to keep the goals of what I need to achieve in these meetings realistic and limited. During this meeting, I try to give them an idea of in which direction we are likely to take the transaction in terms of what types of contract(s) are going to be involved to facilitate and integrate the transaction. I also usually try to give the client a few of the key, and usually poignant, decisions that they will have to make so that they can mull it over between the first and second meetings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the second meeting, I will ask a lot more specific questions. This meeting is all about the details. Prior to the meeting I will have planned out the transaction documents and forked the appropriate templates of whatever documents will be required for the transaction. I use the specific forks of the primary templates as the basis of my checklist for the transaction. This is easy when building templates in legal_markdown form and sublime. I have been building (but haven't open sourced it yet) a small script that automates this process for me. In my contract templates I just type &lt;code>...?ASK?...&lt;/code> or &lt;code>...?CONFIRM?...&lt;/code> and then the script finds these and builds them into a checklist specific to the transaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know a lot of transactional attorneys like to build checklists based on the type of transaction. I have a few of those, but I find that usually I spend more time deleting irrelevant items and overall they are inefficient for me. I prefer to build questions into my document templates and then to build my checklist for the transaction based on the document templates that I'm going to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, this week I've been working on two different joint venture agreements. They are very different from one another and are based on two different templates (one of which is a fork of the main JV template that I have built). For me, it is more efficient to pull my checklists from each of the templates than it would be to fork a main joint venture checklist and then adapt that for each type of transaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In other words, the key is to integrate your checklist building with your template building. This has many distinct advantages, not the least of which are precision and efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The script that builds the checklists for me in sublime produces a list of questions. These provide me with the base the agenda of the second, more detail oriented, meeting with the client. Usually I print the checklist as I find that Somalis usually find a screen in the room either disrespectful or disorienting. So I usually just write my answers on the printed checklist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After that second meeting, I build the first drafts of the documents necessary for the transaction. As I said earlier, I build my templates into a main repo and then fork the necessary templates from the main repo into the repo for the client. When I build templates I fill them with mixins, optional clauses, and questions. All I have to do after the second meeting is to fill in the answers to the questions that I have by replacing all the &lt;code>...?QUESTIONS?...&lt;/code> with the answers. Usually this just means filling in the YAML front matter of the template.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I have finished answering the questions, entering the mixins and selecting or deselecting the optional clauses (all of which I do in the YAML front matter), I simply save the legal_markdown file &amp;amp;&amp;amp; pandoc it based on my contract template .odt. Then I open the .odt in libreoffice where I do a final read through of the contract, tweak the styles if necessary, and save as .pdf / .doc / .odt or whatever the client needs to review the document. All of these steps (minus the final review in libreoffice) I perform from sublime. I build the templates there, I massage the YAML front matter there, I pandoc from there, and I open the .odt file from there. It is basically a full scale contracts IDE for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the client has reviewed the documents I will sometimes edit in Sublime, but if the changes are marginal then I find it more efficient to make the changes in Libreoffice and voila. Done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pandoc for Legal Documents</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2013/2013-01-24-pandoc-legal-documents/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2013/2013-01-24-pandoc-legal-documents/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lately, I have been writing a lot in markdown. It is a freeing way to write documents because you focus more on the words than the tools around you in the wordprocessing interface. You pick your favorite environment to write &amp;ndash; for me it is Sublime Text &amp;ndash; and then you write. But, clients and courts do not read Github Flavored Markdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where &lt;a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/index.html">Pandoc&lt;/a> comes into play. Pandoc is one of the many markdown renderers / translators available. You can think of it like a swiss army knife for changing document types. The thing that makes Pandoc quite interesting, for my purposes as a lawyer, is that it when you translate your markdown into an .odt file (or .docx for those who like completely bloated, prorietary things) you can establish exactly how the end document will look.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you do is first output some markdown text into an .odt file. Then you go into LibreOffice and modify the styles so that they are appropriate. I have templates setup for most of the documents I create and I simply linked the main styles that I use in my markdown to the ones in the template .ott files. I created multiple Pandoc .odt templates (which Pandoc calls reference files) to more or less mirror my .ott files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Sublime, I &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/sublimetext-Pandoc">forked&lt;/a> the excellent Pandoc plugin to modify it so that I could build custom templates and added a few other goodies so that Pandoc would play nicer with .odt files (which were not included in the original version). Using the forked Pandoc plugin I can simply output my markdown files to the appropriate reference file. I use the SideBarEnhancements plugin to right click on the newly created .odt and open in Libre to finalize everything. Mainly this entails dropping in my citations from Zotero and making sure that the styling is fine and everything is looking as it should. Save the new .odt file in GDrive. Output the .pdf to GDrive. Close the task on Teambox. Email the client. Done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most annoying things about using a wordprocesser and doing research is the new lines that pdf copy places on your clipboard. Since Python is a relatively straightforward language and not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> different from Ruby for simple text manipulation, and since Sublime offers a very easy to understand API, it was quite easy &amp;ndash; even for a beginner such as I &amp;ndash; to &lt;a href="https://github.com/compleatang/sublimetext-pastepdf">build a plugin&lt;/a> that will allow me to ctrl+alt+v and thus strip the newlines so that the text block pastes as a single text block.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because Pandoc has inline footnoting, when I'm writing I simply drop in a marker quickly where I need to reference things. When Pandoc translates the markdown into an .odt file it builds the footnotes with the markers I need (usually pinpoints). Then I can simply inserting the citations from Zotero. When I was doing some research the other day I realized that FastCase does not have a translator for Zotero so I started working on one. It will be coming soon. And more about integrating Zotero and LibreOffice for legal research will accompany that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For legal documents, particularly client focused documents, you don't really need that much formatting. Indeed the less the better. Really you need only a handfull of styles within the document. Using a system such as this to force the proper styling techniques you can easily roll branding rules for your small firm and also let lawyers focus on the text rather than another Format Paste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Admitedly, collaboration is still imperfect. A huge percentage of lawyers still are on Word and so the .doc and .docx formats and awful Calibri are not going away anytime soon. There is no simple way, when you need to track changes and integrate comments into a document, to utilize some of the tools that make writing so much more enjoyable on a text processor. Luckily, however, using these techniques allows me to limit my time in a word processor &amp;ndash; even a quite nice one like LibreOffice.&lt;/p>

It has been ongoing for four years that I can remember but perhaps longer. It revolves around the forthrightness of campaigns to speak to the electorate logically, with courage, and while keeping within the bounds of logic and reasonableness. Instead of what I desperately want campaigns to do they do the opposite, spiraling into ever more irrelevant crap. Gaffes and ah ha’s are fun and interesting political theater but that is all it is. Theater. Theater is a farce. And we must stop hiring representatives to govern us based on a farcical audition system. This I have felt deeply for a long time. It colors most of my political worldview, rightly or wrongly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>John Dickerson wrote a &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/WyS3iH" title="How To Measure for a President, by John Dickerson">series&lt;/a> of pieces this week that I hope with all the optimism my increasing cynicism can muster that someday it will be viewed as a transformative work. In his work he pleads with the electorate in a way I know he believes. I’ve spent an hour a week more or less for the past seven years and I believe that he believes every word he wrote. His authenticity is easy to trust and recognize with that much exposure. His argument is basically that we need to rethink about how we treat Presidential campaigns. We are covering the wrong things he says to the media elite. You are emphasizing the wrong things he says to the campaigns. We are rewarding the wrong behavior he tells the electorate. And all of them/us need to hear it because all have a roll in fixing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what can we the electorate do? In my opinion it is our duty to educate ourselves about the issues, about what the President can actually control, and to take a decision based upon those items rather than the metrics of how many gaffes some poor guy or girl exposed to immense pressure takes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An informed and reasonable electorate is the only way we can pull ourselves out of this death spiral of hyper partisanship, reactionary media coverage, and off the charts dissatisfaction. We the electorate have as much to do with this, perhaps more, than the candidates do. Political leaders aren’t really leaders at all. At least in a democracy they are supposed to represent their constituents’ interests. Vying too far outside of these, and the politician loses their representative title. We call those people here in Africa: Dictators. The simple fact is that a politician is constrained by public opinion. So an ill-informed electorate, purposefully or otherwise, will logically reward the loudest rather than the smartest. Here’s the rub. We get the country we demand folks. When we refuse to educate ourselves on what the President does when we don’t demand intellectual and reasoned debate rather than stupid gaffery we end up with….Fox News and MSNBC yelling past each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are in a difficult situation. Right now. In the short term, I’m pessimistic, but in the long term I’m optimistic. I remain hopeful for two primary reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the grip of push consumption models of information continues to wane and simultaneously individual trust is replacing brand trust within the media. The former matters because when one unplugs from cable and consumes media and information on a purely pull model one’s ability to consume and process that information substantially increases. When you are in the mood for bubble gum you aren’t receptive to political messaging. Subliminal and uninformed voters barely process TV adds anymore. We are numb to them. But when you are in the mood for political messaging, you are in much better frame of mind to process that information. This is augmented by – the latter – individual trust located within both of one’s social graphs and interest graphs. Both of these significantly increase the ease which one can enter into the information funnel at headlines and steadily work downward through the increasing complexity to extreme wonkland if interested merely by reading, thinking, and clicking. Twitter leads to articles lead to counter arguments lead to source data. While this information funnel needs some work, people like Ethan Zuckerman at the Berkman Center and other terribly smart guys are thinking deeply about how this can operate. It will get better. And we will get better at using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second reason I resist encroaching cynicism is the rise of the Maker class. Art from Andy Warhol to the Breakfast Club to Rage Against the Machine has been warning us against getting too big and too homogeneous  It won’t work the artists warned. And they led the world. Long before there was a consultant class there were independent artists. But now DIY is everywhere and not only because Home Depot wants to sell you some lumber. Big is out and small is in. And I for one am incredibly satisfied. Music, for me, has never been more diverse and more wonderful. Despite the RIAA apocolypsing, music is the best I have ever experienced. And I’ve been following music for a decent little while now. Food is similarly wonderful. Farm to table restaurants and good wines make the old suburban standbys just places you go by default when you’re not in the know or when you are resigned to mediocrity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small is in. Small is great. But small is messy. It refuses to be categorized as easily. It celebrates the individual, with its flaws and eccentricities, not in tension with the community (as the rhetoric from the right so often tries to frame it) but as part of it. Integral to the flow of the community. But this becomes problematic politically. Or so some argue. If  we decentralize and fracture the currently coalitions underpinning the current form of the Republican and Democratic parties so wonder what will happen thereafter. Some wonder if we had more than two viable national parties whether people would be able to parse the differences. I have no idea whether that is true, but I know that music, which is much farther ahead of politics in this area, is better than it is ever been. This is why I remain (perhaps unreasonably) optimistic.&lt;/p>

Being that I was a Marine officer once upon a moon, this person asked whether my blood was up about them passing away and what I thought about the President putting our people in danger like that. Their words. Yes, of course my blood was up. I felt deeply for their families and for the poor souls who had to notice their families and for the entire situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there is a bigger picture here that I want to point out. These guys faced an impossible task. Utterly impossible. There was no right answer for them and all these people screaming about why aren’t our embassies safer and posting about the poor Marines do a disservice to their service. As Marines we are not in the business of allowing ourselves to be victimized. That, in my opinion,  is a bigger disservice to those Marines than a simple and honest answer: this is the fog of Krulak’s three block war. Before I explain Krulak’s theory, let us first try to picture the decisions these Marines had to take.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was not there that night in Benghazi and I make no claims on knowledge of the attack other than what I’ve seen on the news. The below should be taken for no more than it is meant to be: a thought experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You are in a safehouse and it is 9/11. You are in a predominately Muslim country and as opposed to all the other Muslim countries you’ve likely been in recently, in this one they don’t hate you. In fact you are accompanying the Ambassador to the heartland, the ground zero, of the movement your country helped to achieve power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There have been riots but you likely pay those no mind. Not because you are negligent, but precisely because you are not scared of them. Even if you have been told of possible security concerns, you probably still pay them no mind. You understand the waxes and wanes of the moods of crowds. Sure you stay vigilant. Your helmet stays on and your weapon is there, but it is just people annoyed. They aren’t attacking you. And chances are damn good that you know what it feels like when a crowd turns on you, when the focus of collective disdain is you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or perhaps you do feel it. Perhaps the security briefings and 9/11 and the feel of the crowd tingle your spidey senses. What are you going to do about it? Absolutely nothing. You just stay there, vigilant. Your helmet stays on and your weapon is there. And you watch. And wait. And listen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you hear the woosh of an RPG you barely have any time to react before the bang of the detonation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now what? Do you fire back? Who exactly are you going to fire at? You have very likely been taught that aimlessly shooting into crowds is an atrocious idea. Anyway, it is night and this is guard duty. You know you don’t have the full range of combined arms at your disposal you may have had in Afghanistan or Iraq. You know that you have only a few guys with small arms. And you have no idea who is shooting at you or how many they are. You are smart enough to know that now is not the time for asking the why. You are also smart enough to remember that this city is highly militarized and while they generally like you now, you understand damn well how fleeting that public opinion is. And shooting randomly into the crowd isn’t going to help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you had the luck to see the shooters location and had tracked his movements through the crowds on grainy NVGs because you are a superhuman. And even if that guy was stupid enough to give you a clear shot. (It must be said that the chances for that happening are basically nil) How sure are you that you can make that shot in the midst of a heaving crowd at night from distance?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So do you go after him? If you pursue, you leave the place you are supposed to be guarding, and worse you leave the *person *you are supposed to be guarding. The Ambassador. In the olden days people were hung for decisions like those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ambassador. That jogs your mind. How is he?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above sequence of thoughts took me twenty times longer to type then for you to process. Perhaps a hundred.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You inquire about the ambassador and are told that he is injured. There are people everywhere. People are shouting. It is dark. You have no idea who is who. Still the consulate is being fired on. Even if you were superhuman enough to track the shooter they have melted back into the crowd while you were checking on the ambassador.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This my friends is chaos. Utter and complete chaos. Not complexity. F-ing chaos. You can call it the shit, the fog of war, or any of the other catchy terms people give to it. But that’s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will say this. I am not sad that it was Marines that passed away that night. If it had to have been anyone I would gladly take Marines over private contractors, over anyone else. I want Marines on those walls because I know that they know how to make the best possible decision given the constraints in which they are forced to operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We Marines have had a chip on our shoulder from basically the time of our birth. We have never really fit into the overall structure of the armed forces. We are neither the round peg nor the square hole. We are both. And we are neither. Our neither-ness makes us the first to have our money taken during defense drawdowns, but our both-ness makes us the first to be called on in a crisis. We pride ourselves on our ability to do more with less. To go anywhere and do anything that is asked of us. It is this adaptability, this chameleon like ability to properly react to chaos, that is the reason we guard (ceremonially these days) the White House and (not so ceremonially) embassies all around the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Training for these scenarios used to be standard faire. I have no idea whether it is anymore as I’ve been out of the game for a long time. We train for basically everything. From humanitarian intervention, to quasi conflict (like that night in Benghazi) in crowded spaces full of noncombatants, to full scale kill the enemy conflict. And last week Marines were doing all three of these. In numerous locations around the world. With grace and with honor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is this spectrum from completely mundane and non-violent (but foreign) to fully violent that General Krulak was talking about in 1999 when he wrote his seminal piece called the Strategic Corporal: Leadership in the Three Block War. I had graduated OCS but was not yet a Marine officer when he published that piece. And that piece of work is truly a seminal piece as it influenced greatly an entire generation of Marines. In it Krulak argued that the Marines needed to build a force capable of ratcheting up and down the violence as appropriate for the situation. This is incredibly dangerous stuff. It is much safer to retreat to bases and hide behind technological solutions than it is to get out of the bubble and walk the streets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But under Krulak’s tutelage the Marines adapted. And the fires of a zillion firefights and uneventful patrols have proved old Chuck was right. That young people can be trained to react appropriately and honorably under the craziest, most screwed, utterly chaotic of situations. Because, that’s what Marines, especially Marines who understand the challenges and risks inherent in the three block war, that’s what they do.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to feel emotional about something that is fine. But don’t denigrate the honor of the Marines who died that evening in Benghazi by loftily screaming for more security, higher walls, more razor wire; by pretending that these Marines were some lambs to the slaughter. They may or may not have fought that night, but I have full faith and allegiance to the same that they most certainly had a good reason for whatever they did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I know even more than that they most certainly were not victims to be held up as a symbol in order to win votes. It was Remember the Maine that was the slogan, not Remember the Marines on the Maine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My America Band: Wax Fang</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-04-01-my-america-band/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-04-01-my-america-band/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/4/files/2012/04/IMAG0237.jpg">&lt;img src="http://blog.caseykuhlman.com/assets/images/2012/IMAG0237.jpg" alt="Wax Fang at the Basement 31.03.12 by Casey Kuhlman" tit="Wax Fang at the Basement 31.03.12 by Casey Kuhlman" />&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you sit with people from other countries, it is important to have some fall back, standardized way to explain where you are from. Of course we all have these icons, these posters, these fleeting images that remind ourselves of where we came from and are readily recalled by our frontal cortex when asked to explain ourselves. When we trust the person and we know that the question is meant because the other conversant(s) truly does want to understand us, then we are more easily able to open up and to tell the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I want to explain American rock music, and in a little bit the America that I know and love, to people who only know of America from what their news and Hollywood tells them I have a go to band. My icon for all that is great and wonderful about American rock music. Wax Fang.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are three dudes from Louisville who just build face melting rock and roll music. It is fast, aggressive, in your face, and musically delicious. In something like 2006 or so I saw them at Exit In for what was then known as Next Big Nashville. I think we were going to see a different band and just happened upon Wax Fang. They melted my face. Since then I’ve seen them a couple of times at the Basement. Always I’ve left with a melted face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three dudes who know how to play their instruments really damn well, who don’t hide behind loops and over-reverb and autotuners. They play straight-forward. The guitarist has some David Gilmour, some Bowie. The bassist is just rock solid. And the drummer may be one of my favorite contemporary drummers. When I put on their La La Land album (particularly while driving because what could be more American than that), and drive all I can do is think of this all screwed up, dirty, aggressive, lovely, caring, wonderful country that we’ve built for ourselves and smile. So without further ramblings…. Wax Fang.&lt;/p>

For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>New EUNAVFOR guidelines allow attacking &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23pirate">#pirate&lt;/a> targets on late, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23NATO">#NATO&lt;/a> task force stays maritime. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23somalia">#somalia&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>— Jay Bahadur (@PuntlandPirates) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PuntlandPirates/status/183275482962341888">March 23, 2012&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My thoughts were quickly to escalation. Escalation is important not only for reasons that &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> who feels attacked or invaded would be willing to increase the violence to protect their stuff, but also because Somalis feel incredibly threatened right now. With four other countries operating uninvited in their country along with a bunch of other global jihadists who have very little – but not non-negligible – constituencies within Somali areas. If ever there was a time to beat the hornet’s nest, when they already are upset is not the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently this chatter was due to a press release by the EU which is available &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/GUnMps" title="EU Extends Counter Piracy Mission Off Coast of Somalia">here&lt;/a> (title: EU Extends Counter Piracy Mission Off Coast of Somalia). Their complete release (my emphasis):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On Friday 23 March 2012 the Council of the European Union confirmed its intention to extend the EU Naval Force (EU NAVFOR) counter-piracy mission, Operation ATLANATA off the Somali coast until December 2014.  At the same time the Council also extended the area of operations &lt;em>to include Somali coastal territory&lt;/em> and internal waters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today’s decision will enable Operation Atalanta Forces to work directly with the Transitional  Federal Government and other Somali entities to support their fight against piracy in the coastal areas.  In accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, the Somali government has notified the UN Secretary General of its acceptance of the EU’s offer for this new collaboration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Speaking about the extension of the mandate and area of operations, Rear Admiral Duncan Potts, who is the Operational Commander of the EU Naval Force, said “The extension of the mandate until the end of 2014 confirms the EU’s commitment to fighting piracy off the Horn of Africa. Piracy has caused so much misery to the Somali people and to the crews of ships transiting the area and it is right that &lt;em>we continue to move forward in our efforts&lt;/em>”.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Those five words towards the end of the first paragraph and those eight words at the end of that small press release are important. ICTY was set up because of just about as many words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The BBC ran an &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/GUpBCV" title="Somalia pirates: EU approves attacks on land bases">article&lt;/a> headlined “Somalia pirates: EU approves attacks on land bases.” Here’s the highlights from the article:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told reporters: “The EU plan is to allow attacks on land installations when ships are assaulted at sea,” adding that “much care” would be taken to avoid civilian deaths….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rear Admiral Duncan Potts, the operation commander for the EU Naval Force in Somalia, said … ”At sea we’ve had an effect on the pirates’ ability to operate but we haven’t changed the strategic conditions, which is why we want to target every stage of their operations.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The Minister seems to be implying that only self-defence combined with hot pursuit would be a trigger for attack of land targets; whereas the EU’s commander is seemingly signalling something entirely different that the EU is interested in attacking more strategically to disrupt the entire ecosystem’s operation. That disparity aside, what is difficult to contemplate is what will actually happen with this. We don’t have the actual directive at this point (if you have a copy I’d love to see it) so how can we tell legally what the heck is going on?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also problems (in my mind at least) with the use of force at all, but at least on the high seas to stop an operation in progress we can skirt around many of the IHL issues that could be invoked. IHL is the acronym for International Humanitarian Law which is known by many laypersons as the Law of War. There are two sets of basic sets of rules that can be used to regulate the activities of the piracy enforcement regime. IHL is one. I do not think that it is involved. After living and lawyering in the Somali region for four years, I remain deeply skeptical as to the purported links between those accused of acts of piracy and those involved in the conflict not of an international character between the various factions on land within South-Central Somalia. From time to time there are reports that Shabaab is somehow involved, but I have yet to see those sufficiently substantiated (at least in my mind). This is important, because without these linkages then IHL will not be operative and another body of law will control the piracy enforcement regime: International Human Rights Law (IHRL).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is much more complex then this, but let me simplify for the purposes of this post: IHL is very lenient set of rules compared to IHRL in the area of the application of violence. The language used by the Rear Admiral above is very much in keeping with IHL norms that allow military commanders to target and attack based on the overall military advantage of such attacks. In other words, German industrial towns pose no direct threat to the allies during WWII, but the allies legally leveled these cities due to the overall military advantage of shutting down the industrial system that was supplying German troops with arms and ammunition. Human rights law has a very different take on the application of violence due to the paramount importance that it places on the right to life alongside fair trial rights. Human rights law does not allow the application of violence with such a sweeping scope as IHL. It requires a much more surgical approach along with some provocation. The standard under IHRL is that there must be an immediate threat to life in order for a law enforcement officer to kill a suspect, or else the suspect must be taken to court where fair trial rights can be invoked to decide of the suspect can be put to death.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/GUtQyd" title="Beth Van Schaack">Beth Van Schaack&lt;/a> wrote an Opinion Juris &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/GY8mgp" title="A Response to Douglas Guilfoyle by Beth Van Schaack">post&lt;/a> about this IHLIHRL issue about a while ago (November, 2010):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>[Professor Guilfoyle] concludes that in the majority of circumstances, piracy is a law enforcement problem, not a law of war problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The seemingly facile conclusion of the article, however, dodges the more difficult question of the impact of a potential nexus between acts of piracy and the ongoing non-international armed conflict in Somalia between the beleaguered Transitional Federal Government and a loose coalition of fundamentalist militias. If such a link is eventually established or confirmed, IHL may apply to some acts of piracy committed in order to fund organized armed groups or regional warlords engaged in the protracted insurgency against the government of Somalia. The article would have made a more significant contribution had it focused more searchingly on this question of what type or degree of war nexus would be necessary to trigger the application of IHL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One implication of such a nexus would be that attacks on commercial vessels such as we have seen in the Gulf of Aden may become prosecutable as war crimes (&lt;em>viz&lt;/em>, violence to life and person or the taking of hostages)….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Regardless of the application of IHL, the international community should not lose sight of the fact that international human rights law remains applicable to the collective international response to acts of piracy. In a companion piece, Professor Guilfoyle focuses on the law governing the extraterritorial application of human rights law, the principle of non-refoulement, the prohibition of arbitrary detention, and due process protections (see Douglas Guilfoyle, Counter-Piracy Law Enforcement and Human Rights, 59 Int’l &amp;amp; Comp L Q 141 (2010)). In addition, the prohibitions of summary execution and other arbitrary deprivations of the right to life also establish limitations of necessity and proportionality on uses of force against individuals in the exercise of national and international police powers (see McCann v UK, 21 EHRR 97 (1996)).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The distinction between the two sets of rules are important not only because they have very different rules in how they authorize law enforcement or military personnel to apply violence towards a given situation, but also they are important to our understanding of the cultural dynamics of a given situation. When we think something is regulated by IHL we mentally apply a militaristic point of view to a situation. This is the problem when we call it the War on Terrorism when in my opinion it should be more properly characterized as a law enforcement situation against acts of terrorism. In any event, the conflict between the US and Al Qaeda aside, when it comes to Somalis the law enforcement versus military lens is extraordinarily important because as I said earlier Somalis already feel they are under attack. Largely there is a perception that the pirates are basically Robin Hood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sending military task forces to attack land targets in Eyl or any of the other pirate areas would be disastrous foreign policy as it would not only endanger all of us Westerners that operate in the Somali region but it would also have a counter effect to the desired end state. The Somali society has been turning against the pirate culture slowly by slowly, but attacks on land targets would allow them to leverage the nationalistic undercurrents within Somali culture to regain their cultural momentum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can basically think of no policy which would be worse than this policy and I truly hope that when the EUNAVFOR implements it, they take a close look at both the legal and cultural effects of what they are doing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For almost four years now I’ve been a careful observer of Somali politicians. For three of those years I was paid to try to be their lawyer. To provide them expert international legal assistance tied to a deep network full of some of the finest international practitioners and thinkers in the world. But they rarely, if ever, wanted that help. So largely I invented work, I went into meetings and had a product to sell. &lt;em>I can’t buy you new computers, but I how about I help you write that legal framework that Parliament has required you to do&lt;/em>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve spent a lot of time with Somali politicians, and I also spend a lot of time with other people who spend a lot of their time with Somali politicians. This is an expat’s life when you live in a pretty small town. I reference Hargeisa, a town of, oh, 500,00 to 1M people depending on who’s estimating as a small town.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that it truly is. This is one of the most amazing things when you really get to know an African town. To learn how inter-connected things are is fascinating. This is what makes me do something foolish like invest everything I have into starting a law firm in a country which has very little (if any) law. Judges routinely dismiss cases with little to no justification. Parliamentarians make no estimates, and rarely even discuss, what the effects of this law will be in the next month, much less the next year – so legislation (a lot of it quite decent) is routinely ignored.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet things work. I don’t believe in libertarianism – much to my father’s chagrin – it is incredibly unjust and inefficient. But I can say the Somalis are teaching me how to respect it, and how to work within its boundaries. I know a little but more importantly I truly care deeply about this place. I have spent more time in this place than I had in any one place since I was in college. I have joined, in many ways, the ranks of the diaspora (only the opposite way that that term is used).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time, when I first arrived, it seemed like no one really got what the hell was happening down here. See Nairobi is a long way away. And after the 2008 Hargeisa bombings, when pretty much all of the expats left the connections between Hargeisa and Nairobi were even more tenuous. So a disconnect really felt like it developed. Luckily, over the course of the previous year it has &lt;em>felt&lt;/em> like “Nairobi” is starting to get it. I don’t agree with everything I’m hearing coming out of the high level cluster meetings and typical other rumor mill stuff, but I must say that I agree with a lot of it (see, e.g., &lt;a href="http://blogs.fco.gov.uk/mattbaugh/2012/01/1a7/london-conference-on-somalia-building-momentum/" title="London Conference, Building Momentum">this initiative&lt;/a> by the UK’s government).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did not think that a harder military strategy off the coast would reduce piracy. I really felt that a tribunal in Somaliland along with a huge police building effort in Puntland was the best possible shot at fixing things (basically pirate DDR is what needs to happen); I still feel this needs to happen, but the military situation seems to be putting a recent damper on the number of attacks. So they may be right, they may be wrong, but at least they aren’t &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/zA7LWR" title="Somali Pirates Seize 80% Fewer Ships as Early Strikes Work‎">dead wrong&lt;/a>. Not the way they were dead wrong in the early nighties when everyone that knew anything about Somalia would tell you how clearly wrong some of the actions were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nairobi (by which I mean the big money and big – even if distant – powers), seems to be starting to understand two things: there has to be some element of external assistance to stabilize the situation, BUT the Somalis want to have assurances that this isn’t an invasion or their territorial fires start overheating. To do that largely means staying the hell out of the politics BUT also helping to create the conditions of stability long enough for the Somalis to figure out how they will be represented and what the terms are – which can often take months or years – even where you have a majority clan conferences these things take lots of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most Somali analysts are quick to point out that the reason the South cannot seem to fix itself is that the Italians castrated the clan leader system. The problem has been for a long time that no one had the moral authority – among the Southern clans – to stand up to the gangsters that kept hijacking clan resources, state resources, international resources. They just continued to gobble them up like locusts and when they reached an end to their resources they just started gobbling each other. From the early warlord phase into the ICU takeover this is what continued happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a couple of other things were happening also beneath the surface of that. For twenty years there seems to have been an identity crisis within much of the Somali community. This identity, just like lots of things in our lives, runs to the safest place it can find when it is threatened. For most Somalis that is somewhere around one or two or three or four or five clans below the major clan level. It varies by the individual and their experience where this safe place is. One thing I can say for sure, that for most people I’ve met in four years Northerners, Southerners, Easterners and Westerners, for the vast vast percentage of these people that place is no where even close to the pan-Somali level. This is and will for a long time remain the invalidity in the argument that the pan-Somali movement was a viable option without a dictator.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even after twenty years Somaliland politicians bicker nearly continuously; lack of trust within Somaliland is rife. The same can be said, only the distrust rises as you go clockwise around the circle.This deep distrust is deep seated in Somali lore going back to way before the mad mullah. By the time you get to Isaaq’s grandsons, they were already fighting with each other. I don’t like all my cousins, but I certainly know I’m not ready to fight with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily the Somalilanders – at the end and often despite this distrust – they make it work. Things haven’t fallen apart here and actually are going pretty well. It has taken a long time to solidify the post-conflict gains and to begin the development phase of their state building, but it is going. And, perhaps more importantly, it is going at a Somali pace. Somaliland really did have to retract after it separated from the South into basically a federated microstate solution. Sure there was a central government created at the Burco conference. But the amount of power and influence of that government was marginal. One cannot compare the power that Silanyo has with the power that Tuur had. The central government was present, but it has taken almost two decades of steady work before anyone gives it any mind about being anything other than a minor inconvenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is another incredibly fascinating thing about being here now, this is the point where the Somaliland Government is really figuring itself and really trying to exert some will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gets us to the microstate solution. In my view, it should be endorsed as it is probably the best viable option currently. Some of the donors seem to be realizing that – as reflected in much of the language coming from the UK as well as the US’s two-track policy shift. In my opinion, the donors need to throttle back the incentives for state capture. When the mandate for the TFG ends UNDP needs to have the political courage to stop paying Parliamentarian salaries, and other than emergency aid the rest of the money flowing into the South needs to end. Then the donors need to let the Somalis work from their grassroots (microstate) levels up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equal with this the Somalis have to take ownership. They really have to stop blaming &lt;em>all&lt;/em> of their problems on the international community and take ownership for their own mistakes. I can fully accept many Somalis gripes about the prior actions of external actors. And I fully understand their paranoia about external interventions in their problems. But equally they have to trust a bit more. And they have to take a lot more ownership. This is, at its most elemental, a Somali problem, and they have to be the ones to figure the solutions out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am cautiously optimistic about London Conference. A lot of the right things appear to being said. We will see what will happen but if the donors really wanted to get to the roots of the problems, they need to just shut up and they need to hold their next conference in a place which is neutral &lt;em>enough&lt;/em> to get all of the important-to-Somalis people under a great big, giant ass tree and then they need to not show up and to not pay. And then let them stay there until they figure it out. It will take a hell of a long time, but it will get done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has taken the fine work of a lot of Somalis and Westerners for the awareness to be sufficiently raised as to why we’re here and what the hell can we do about it. I must say for the first time in a while I’m cautiously optimistic about all of the Somali region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more perspective on the London Conference here are a few articles I thought highly incisive, particularly from the Somaliland view point: &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/zh7Zcm" title="Somaliland and the London Conference on Somalia">Article 1&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/z1OXHx" title="Six Elements for Success of Somali Conference in UK">Article 2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Day in My Life: Somaliland Edition</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-01-29-day-in-life-somaliland/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2012/2012-01-29-day-in-life-somaliland/</guid><description>&lt;p>The other day, my dad asked me to write a short piece about what my daily life is like in Somaliland. I usually refrain from such things, but I think it is a good opportunity to show how &lt;em>normal&lt;/em> everything is here. With a few caveats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Office Guest Suite][2]][2]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I generally awake between 9 and 10. Although this is late for a work day, if you read to the end you’ll see why. Mostly everyone else is out of the office in the morning either in court or meetings or taking care of personal errands. This is great for me, since I’m a slow waker so I like the peacefulness in the mornings as it lets me wake at a reasonable pace. In many ways the afternoons and mornings are sort of flipped around from life in the US. Things start slowly here for almost everyone. Although I used to have my own house that I rented, these days I’m spending less long stretches in Hargeisa and so we have built a sleeping room here at the office for me to use when I’m here and for the team to use after a late night working when I’m not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![][3]][3]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a freezing cold shower that although painful is effective at getting your juices flowing, I head into our office. I share and office with Hassan, my Vice President, but he is rarely there in the mornings. I like to begin my day with a cup of coffee and some news, as many others do. Here that comes in a flask of Ethiopian coffee my watchman brings from our close Ethiopian tin shack shop and accompanied by my scans of my Google Reader (using Feedly’s skin), Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr feeds. I generally do a more or less quick scan in the mornings. I read a few smaller articles from my feeds, but I just generally skim the headlines and then mark the longer articles that seem interesting for my Readability queue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After I’m finished with the news, I then usually begin working on whatever lies in front of me. I usually try to start the working day with the mundane admin tasks that don’t require as much thought as my client work. About 12:30 or 1:00 I’ll realize that I’m hungry and ask my watchman to go bring my lunch. We have a hotel about two blocks away that serves a decently nice chicken sandwich and edible fries (which is my typical lunch order). When I reach a stopping point in my work then I take a small break and migrate into our chewing room. This usually involves several trips to get all of the waste baskets in the office, rearrange the cushions in the room, make sure the tea cups and ashtrays are brought in, and also that all my accoutrement is ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Chewing Session][4]][4]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like to eat in the relaxation of the sitting room while listening to either some music or a podcast. The rest of the gang usually arrives somewhere between 2 and 3. Our majlis is almost always open to people if they are interested in coming to chat with us. The only times we ask people not to come are when we have a meeting planned. On a typical afternoon, we’ll have 7 to 10 people with us for varying lengths of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![My Chewing Position][5]][5]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chewing sessions are interesting. You make an effort to prepare your spot so everything you’ll need for the next 6 to 12 hours is within your reach. You make sure that your water, your tea, your soft drinks, your fake beer, your chat, your phone, your computer (and cord), your wallet, keys, everything is just around you. At our office, we developed a habit of using our wastebaskets as small tables for our laptops. It works fantastically as the laptop doesn’t overhead and when you’re sitting on the floor it is at a really good height so your back does not get jarred. Also it is quite easy to move when you are changing the way that you sit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chewing sessions generally start quite festive and then steadily deteriorate into quietness. Everyone usually is chatting at the beginning, or reading some news, or checking their facebook. Then after everyone is more or less settled in they begin work. In many offices, not only ours, the real work takes place at chewing sessions. Although many expats in Hargeisa are very much against qat (for admittedly valid reasons) the argument that it makes people lazy I simply don’t buy. For me, it focuses me and I actually work quite well when I’ve had a normal dosage of qat. The high you get from qat, if one can even call it a high, is very subtle and take a long time to settle in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some people join us but do not have work that day so they will chat or listen to Somali songs or watch TV depending on their moods. The rest of us either put on headphones or we just listen as we are working. It is not unlike a co-working space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The great thing about a chewing session is that when you need a break or if you have a question you just ask or you just visit with people. If something comes on the news people will generally discuss. If there had been a big political incident earlier that day it will get analyzed in detail. And sometimes people will just work or chat on facebook. It is a very relaxed environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually people leave between 9 and 10. At this point in the night, I’m usually getting my best work done and so I will often stay going until about 2 or 3 when I snoozily saunter to the sleeping room. Then the cycle starts all over again. So that’s a typical Somaliland day. With a few pictures.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I was in college my friend Dave and I would often fall asleep at some point during our millionth screening of Braveheart. We would often put the film on after the bars had closed and we had grabbed our drunken treat of the night and were not yet ready for bed. At the time we were training to be Marine officers and very interested in learning what it took to be a good leader. Near the beginning of the film there was a quote which I often thought about (at still think about):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You admire this man, this William Wallace. Uncompromising men are easy to admire. He has courage; so does a dog. But it is exactly the ability to &lt;em>compromise&lt;/em> that makes a man noble. And understand this: Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit on the throne of England. And none of us, and nothing of Scotland will remain, unless &lt;em>we&lt;/em> are as ruthless. Give ear to our nobles. Knowing their minds is the key to the throne.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We would scoff at this quote. In our youth and lack of exposure to the world we felt that uncompromising was the way of the greatest leaders. That may still be true, but I have learned that it definitely is not true of the greatest rulers. Indeed, the greatest rulers are often those that are the greatest to compromise. Human nature being what it is, you will very rarely have complete agreement with a course of action. Multiply the amount of people a decision will affect and you necessarily multiply the different opinions (both rational and irrational) which will impact your decision before it is taken and laud or critique it after it is taken. This is a fundamental “problem” with ruling in a democracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ryan Lizza has written a fantastically interesting piece for The New Yorker. He dives deeply into a trove of memos which circulated the Obama White House during the first term of that administration. He assembles a very interesting piece which does a great job of detailing the tensions that any President may face. I encourage everyone to read it, &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/zTXpzr" title="The Obama Memos">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is interesting for me, given my current diaspora state (relatively torn between Europe, America, and Africa), to compare the political processes which take place in a very new, somewhat inchoate democracy – Somaliland – to a very old, overly complex democracy – the US – while comparing both, which I view as an insider, to the relatively “clean” democratic processes that the Europeans embody. One of the difficult things in an independent executive system, where the governing functions of creating laws and putting those laws into action are separated between two branches of government, is that we tend to blame the “big man” for all of the problems. This happens in Somaliland just as often as it happens in the US. The realities of Presidential campaigns often do a disservice by blurring the lines. Much of the debate during a Presidential campaign revolves around big or small policy ideas that the President will have very little to no control over. As I was telling someone the other day, a President has an ability to stop a legislative action it doesn’t want to allow but it has little ability to make a legislative body do something that that body does not want to do. Yet these big policy ideas are a function of modern politics. Firstly they are easier to discuss than the minutae of what a President really does. Secondly, it is a method of acting somewhat uniformly in our very much decentralized system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, reading the piece shows me what I was hoping to see. A President who has learned how to do what is possibly the most difficult and complex job on the planet. A President who remains willing to make compromises, but also has learned how to work the system. A President who still has standards and struggles to balance a bowing to the political winds with a deep devotion to his ideals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While Obama cannot get a large piece of greenhouse gas passed through (right now) domestically, he has floated a ton of money for research, innovation, and implementation of greenhouse reduction initiatives in other countries. While Obama faces complete stonewalling from his own legislators on jobs (right now), he has figured out how to incentivize job growth and business creation in other countries with entrepreneurial grants and collaborative agreements dominating much of the AID/DOS grants I’ve seen lately. While Obama cannot push forward comprehensive immigration reform (right now), he has put in place policies which make it much easier to get US visas (while remaining within the legislative caps mandated by various amendments to the Immigration and Nationalization Act) and illegal immigration flows are down – particularly from Mexico. These are largely international examples for a couple of reasons. First it is my area of interest so I follow it closer. Second the President has fundamentally more power over foreign policy than domestic policy. Third, Hillary – despite how divisive she may or may not be – is a brilliant bureaucrat and many of these initiatives are coming from her shop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No government is perfect, but where the President and his team have a reasonable amount of power I am genuinely pleased with what I see. There’s much to disagree with, but there is much more that I agree with. As we turn towards a full scale assault on us all with respect to choosing our next President one thing I would encourage everyone to do is to not get tricked by the red herrings of advertisements and debates and to focus on what the President can and does actually do on a daily / weekly / monthly / yearly basis. Choose wisely.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We are smack in the middle of a heck of a travelling ten days. Left Chattanooga where we had Christmas for Glasgow where we had New Years via Atlanta (shuttle), London (plane), and Edinburgh (rental car). Then down to L’s farm in Southwest corner of Scotland. Then up to Edinburgh for a nap then to Den Haag via Amsterdam (plane and train). Thursday I trek down to Hargeisa via Zurich, Dubai, and Berbera.&lt;br>
Since I only have a very limited time here in the Hague before I return to Hargeisa, today I had to go get my haircut. I had been in the states for a few months and L wasn’t sure about the state of my hair upon arriving for the Christmas celebrations. The current outlook was grim at any rate. I had purposely delayed getting it cut (and my beard closely trimmed) because I am sometimes incredibly neglgent at life but also because I quite like my Turkish barber here in the Hague.&lt;br>
One thing I am learning about myself is how important patronage is. When I view it through the lens of community formation, patronage becomes exceedingly important to me. The word patron is a funny word. Reconciling medieval notions of artists who had patrons with more modern exclamatories of “don’t patronize me” leaves quite an imterpretive swath. Yet, the patronage I mean I to give someone your business more or less on a regular basis. Sometimes it is an exclusive arrangement; sometimes not. In others words I mean it in the same sense as to become a regular.&lt;br>
Some of the difficulties of living a nomad’s life are eased by assembling small pockets of communities where you are known. But communities, are living things and thereby require engagement in order to survive and to thrive. If you don’t participate in and engage with your communities the linkages between you and them whither. Sometimes it takes an extraordinarily long time for the connections to whither – as I found upon a trip to visit old, grand friends in September after too long apart. Sometimes it doesn’t take long at all for connections to whither – as I found out upon numerous trips to the same Panera where they never once gave me a singular look of recognition.&lt;br>
When the barber was almost ready for me, one of his partners walked in and asked me into his chair. I politely refused the earliest available barber for my guy. My guy speals not a lick of English and I not a lick of Dutch. So we have said very little to one another besides yes / no and some serious sign language. And yet, I feel (perhaps it is one sided) that we have a connection. When I saw me walk in there was a look of recognition on his face. Perhaps he’s just a good actor, but either way it made me feel quite happy to be a known commodity instead of an unknown commodity briefly flitting into and out of existence.&lt;br>
When I first sat in his chair on our first meeting, he looked at my hair for a second, realized I didn’t speak Dutch and then just  grabbed some of my hair indicated a length, I said no, he went shorter, I said yes. That was it until the end when I smiled and rubbed my chin. He used his finger and thumb to indicate short, medium, or long. I said medium with my fingers. Then I gave him the money and went on my way happier for the nice relax and small nap I had gotten while at the barber. Many like to go to their barbers for the news and gossip. I like to go to close my eyes and have a bit of relax. To turn my brain off for a split second. After that first cut, when L saw it, she said it was the best cut I had received in ages. This sealed the deal. So now I am his customer.&lt;br>
I have been a few times since that first time and every time I enjoy the ridiculous Turkish sappy pop songs and the fifties traditional decorating scheme with its marble and glass shelves and perfume bottles and potted plants and overall uptown Manhattan feel circa 1950. But also I get a really great haircut. So now I am willing to get a bit feral in order to wait till I can get back to the Hague to see my barber.&lt;br>
This is a pretty normal way of living ones life it seems to me. Most people I know have a favorite haircutter. It is a funny profession in that way. So universal. It should be known as the fourth or fifth oldest profession. Every community on earth has a barber shop and for a vast majority of the communities the barber shop is a hub of the community. A gathering point for gossip and discussion. A place which did not require the time or effort that a pub required. A place which you never know who you would run into. I like that even if I cannot gossip about who recently married whom at my barber shop, that I can at least walk in and he knows what to do.&lt;br>

He waits for a call that he hopes will end the worst purgatory he has ever felt. He waits for a call that will shatter his world. Will it be ne or the other, or the continuation of time stiff arming his attempts to do….something. Anything. For fuck’s sake this happens to other people, not to my people. I know these things because I know my friend. I know he will not sleep tonight, even though I told him to. I know this because I can see the green dot of presence when I incessant check facebook, just as impotently emasculated as he. For news. Of something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No one doubts that aid work is hard. We &lt;a href="http://stuffaidworkerslike.com">bitch and moan&lt;/a> about lack of food, shitty water, lack of fast internet and all the rest of it. But it is the times like this when the real shit happens. These are the times when it is truly hard. when doing your job puts your family and closest of friends at risk. Why the fuck do we do what we do? For them? For us? For a job?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want with 95% of my soul to jump on a plane. But what on earth will that accomplish? Nothing. So instead of channeling my own rage for the angst and suffering of my friends I am left to watch the list of ‘Praying for you”s grow on a facebook wall. There is no way to reason through it. There is nothing to do. I can put my head in my hands. I can support. And that’s it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead, I write this. I write about friendship. Because in aid, unlike in any other industry I know of, you forge friendships which are simply impossible in other worlds. After spending a week with someone laughing at your inability to leave the compound because the threat of terrorists attacks is too high (even for risk takers from small NGOs). After drinking yourself stupid after the most vicious of weeks imaginable. After chuckling at the little absurdities and cultural incongruities. After talking politics of a country not your own. After vacationing to the most beautiful little tucked away shitholes in the world. After wine at sunset. And dogs at dusk. After making bread, and canning peppers, and christmas dinner for all you know together. After these and a million other memories which you cherish for the rest of your life. You come to know people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no thoughts which are greater than this. I have been unable to think today. My thoughts are in a place far from here. My brain is non-existent. And I wait. And I hope. And maybe, just maybe, for the first time in a long time. I pray.&lt;/p>

That&amp;#8217;s What I&amp;#8217;ve Been Waiting For.</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-09-09-the-preacher-is-back-thats-what-ive-been-waiting-for/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Sep 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-09-09-the-preacher-is-back-thats-what-ive-been-waiting-for/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just finished watching the jobs speech and my first thought was “were have you been”? The historian-poet-preacher in him which I fell in love with in the Yes We Can and Race speeches (collectively rather than individually) had found his groove tonight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every artist struggles with finding their artistic voice, but for me, at this moment, this was balm to my soul. Someone, somewhere, does actually get it. But before I get to what I liked about the speech let me take a small detour and talk about how I think about my relationship between me and my government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m currently staying at my brother’s, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/kuhlman">@kuhlman&lt;/a>, house and he has a great dane. Due to our pomo lives we missed each other. He is off on a construction job overnight and I just returned from an overnight job myself. We missed each other and were not able to pass a key back and forth. When we were texting each other as to our current statuses and how we could coordinate this changeover, I asked him whether the house was locked. He responded, “Maggie’s the lock.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now Maggie is a wonderful bitch (which I mean literally). This bitch has a bark that will tear your hair off when she gets scared. I have no idea whether she has the bite to match it, and I like that I don’t know that, because her bark is scary enough. She is the perfect lock. See locks are on-off switches. But living, breathing beings are able to differentiate between when on is OK and off is OK. Sometimes the best lock is the one that can differentiate between when to bark and when to be happy because your friend is here to let you out to go take a piss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this is how I want my government to be. I don’t want to rely on my government unnecessarily. I understand that my successes and my failures are my own. But sometimes you want to know that if you are forced, due to the situations of living your life, to deviate from your normal patterns, that there will be a being there to have your back. You don’t want something that is impersonal and cannot differentiate between friend and foe. You want a bitch there that is both happy to see you and happy to go have a poo in the yard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That story said, there were many things that I loved about the Obama speech.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, he chastised both sides. He told some hard truths. These words were his preacher robes which I have not seen him don for a long, long time. Too long. And it was needed. Both sides of the political aisle have been being babies for a while now and the only people suffering are the middle class of America. This &lt;em>must&lt;/em> change. The only way to get shit done is to sometimes put aside the differences and realize that the betterment of the country is at stake. Since I’ve spent so much time in African countries where politics is so personality based I am especially receptive to the in-out-group mechanisms which operate in such an environment. And if you want to actually help, if you want to get something done in this world you’re going to have to figure out a compromise. Because, as the President of the United States, said “No single individual built America on their own. We built it together. .” What a great line. Sometimes we have to act as a community. Individualism is great, but no one at no time has EVER acted completely in isolation as an individual. We call those beings the last creature of their species. What is required, from time to time, is looking out for those that may not be as smart, or have the opportunities, or whatever as we fancy of ourselves. And in that vein, next week I hope to go pound some nails to help members of my family’s community who were affected by the tornadoes earlier this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, it was perhaps the most patriotic speech which has been given during my lifetime. It was a call to action. It was competitive (which we Americans love). It told us that there was going to be some hard days ahead. This was the poet that I’ve been longing for. This was the inspiration that I’ve been hoping for. This was the America that I have studied and that I love. Just turn off your brain (I’ll get to the wonky stuff in a moment) and listen to the words of his speech and tell me that you are not inspired by &lt;em>something&lt;/em>, or even &lt;em>anything&lt;/em> in this speech. No matter your political affiliation this man gets that he was “hired” to execute the laws in the best interest of us all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, it cut through all the bullshit, stupid rhetoric which neither matters nor helps. He has learned from his own failures to properly leverage both the power of his position and the wave of people power which put him in that chair. This was a pragmatic speech to its core. What he said is exactly, *exactly, *what economists have proven matter for the economic development of your country. There are many opinions as to the best, but almost every economist will agree that what is necessary for economic development (this comes from my international development perspective) is: infrastructure, education, jobs for low-skilled individuals, and healthcare. We’ll leave aside for now the reasons why each of these exist. Similarly I’m going to take a mulligan on healthcare because I don’t have the energy to enter that debate as to why people that don’t have millions in the bank don’t *deserve *to not feel awful all the time, but if you care about that watch Sicko and shutup. But see here’s the thing. Our schools are falling apart. While we prosecute irrational wars overseas (which I’ve participated in and have some modicum of epistemic authority here), we’re not able to give the support that our teachers require to educate our children. Our infrastructure is subpar. Visit Europe and try to convince me that we are still number one. Drill, Baby, Drill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this is a short review, but my early take (before reading any punditry) is that it was brilliant and one of Obama’s best performances. On a personal level I’m happy for three reasons: (1) the poet I wanted is finding his voice, (2) the pragmatist we all need is finally leveraging his platform, and (3) the wonk in me is reassured that someone up there will bark when necessary and greet when necessary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There were many great moments of this speech for me. But the one that stands out. The one that I will think of tomorrow. Is this.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No single individual built America on their own. We built it together. We have been, and always will be, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another. Members of Congress, it is time for us to meet our responsibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What did you think of the speech?&lt;/p>

While I was getting ready for work my phone was streaming an album which I found last night to be ultra-enjoyable. My headphones were with me; so, I plugged them into the phone and started walking. Got to work; sat down at my desk computer to type this; the album is still playing. Seamlessly it has flown to my ears via 4G wireless and .11n wireless. I have not purchased this album, but I’m going to see the band in about 10 days if I’m able.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is our wonderful, vibrant, modern world. Where pop music is crowd-sourced and GOOD. No more do we need to rely on corporate people with obvious biases and conflicting inclinations, torn between their artistic roots and boardroom future, who push out to the masses bubblegum crap. These days bubblegum crap still does OK, but nothing like it did in the 90′s. These days, if you don’t have a real soul, if you lack authenticity, you are less likely to “make” it than in the past. I listened to a Moth podcast by one of the Milli Vanilli guys earlier this week who was talking about how things went down for them. I cannot even imagine that happening. Even the corporate music world (I think) understands that it takes more than a pretty face, great hair, and an ability to dance to make it. Unless you want to be a dancer – which you can. I love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you wanted to impress a girl you brought her over, and if she was artsy you figured out a way to let her see your music collection. CDs organized on metal or wooden racks prominently displayed in your room. This is how it was done for decades. Because as was said in High Fidelity, “music, art, television, these things matter, they connect us.” It was a shorthand way to tell her your story in a really interesting way. The tingles of “ohhhhhh, I looooooove this album” and you knew that you had made a connection. Those things were real. Although we are losing the physical objects, it seems to me that the social interaction portion is still very much alive and well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we get to spotify. My friend Frank sent me an invite a couple of weeks ago, and I must say it is only alright if you don’t pay. But then I said let me try their pay service. And a whole new world opened up. It is unbelievable. They have figured out the perfect marriage of a huge library, vibrant community of humans I actually know, along with all my music. What I love about it, is that to be cool on spotify doesn’t matter how big your record collection is, because everyone is operating on the same exact set of tunes. It doesn’t matter if you are a rich person who can afford to spend hundreds on tons of new CD’s or if you are dirt poor and just want to listen to great stuff. You both are operating on the same pay model and have access to the same stuff. We Americans love our individuality and there is something to be said for that, but the Europeans have gone much further than we have in figuring out how to manage communities by sharing. So what &lt;em>does&lt;/em> matter on Spotify. I’m not sure as I’m really new to the community, but I suspect what really matters is not the size or breadth of the money that you have spent on albums but on what you have put together, what you have created, mashed up, and collated. It is is your playlists idiot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s how I’m going to judge you in our amazing, cloudy, pomo world. Have a great day everyone, find some good art, enjoy the hell out of it, smile at your neighbors and dance for no reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you want to know what album I was loving, check out this band.&lt;/p>

If I had to title the alteration, I would call it An Homage to Motherhood&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a bit random in nature, but it is a compilation of some sources and commentary and thought. So think of it as more of a collage than a strict narrative. Much of this was originally posted on &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/nunfsy" title="Original Post">Google &lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thought-1-early-warning-systems-worked">Thought 1: Early Warning Systems Worked&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We’ve known this was coming for well over six months. According to &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r1eFZk">here&lt;/a>, it has been well known since November 2010 which seems about right to me. Those that are paid to do handle these things were trying their best (more on that in a minute) to address the situation but were unable to deliver the food aid at that time. There’s little to suggest that anything has changed in the interim and delivery of the aid will somehow be magically easier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Up here in Somaliland we were taking bucket showers as early as March of this year. Although it does take a while to get to the point where there is a certified famine (due to a strict criteria to certify a disaster/drought as a famine), all of the early warning systems worked. The rains ended up coming for Somaliland, but they did not come (until a couple of weeks ago, and way too late for the livestock and vegetables) for the South. Yet in Somaliland the Government took a lot of steps to ease the suffering of the pastoralists and farmers in their territory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Amaryta Sen is famous for saying that all famines are avoidable failures of governments. Somaliland’s government passed that test. Ministers were out escorting water tankers into the country-side, TV shows on water conservation were aired on national television (not that Somalis need these lessons, but anyway), and mostly it was a local re-distribution effort rather than an international aid effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is an impossible hypothetical what would have happened if the rains had not come to Somaliland. Yet, I suspect that the efforts would have been decently well-thought out and executed as a community. All of it would have been led by Somalis with the international community playing a supporting role, as it should be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thought-2-extent-of-suffering">Thought 2: Extent of Suffering&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The famine is confined to two regions of very Southern Somalia which are sparsely populated to begin with. Although millions are at risk, it isn’t millions that are actually suffering. This isn’t meant to minimize the suffering of those that are suffering, it is simply to bring some perspective. I’m not cynical, how can you be when you look at pictures like &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/qYLsnF" title="mourning at the grave of a 3 y/o">this&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coincidentally, these are the same areas where al-Shabaab has a very strong control over the population. One picture that has certainly caught my eye is of a Shabaab soldier with rows and rows of squatting women behind him looking distraught. The photographer obviously focused on the warrior, but the women in the background are the stars of the shot for me. It is a soberingly iconic reminder of what is really going on. See the picture &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/q5CAfm" title="shabaab soldier and women">here&lt;/a>, and look close.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shabaab has been playing both sides of this issue. First they banned nearly every aid agency from working in their zones. This was a long time ago, and ironically enough when I’ve been in Nairobi talking to people who work in the South they were telling me that the (non-Somali) agencies which were allowed to continue working were faith-based organizations like &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/nhch7c">World Vision&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r07JSt">ADRA&lt;/a>. Mostly these organizations were headed by one or at most two Kenyans and largely they were left alone to do their work, except for one young aid worker I heard about who was killed by Shabaab for proselytizing. We may feel bad for the man’s family, but it was a bit of &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/n2KAxP">Darwinism&lt;/a> at work if you ask me.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thought-3-aid-agencydysfunctionalism--restrictions">Thought 3: Aid Agency Dysfunctionalism &amp;amp; Restrictions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>WFP-Somalia is, for those of us that have been in/worked on Somalia for more than 30 seconds, about the &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oomANF">most&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/n58Y82">dysfunctional&lt;/a>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oqX8Y5"> organization&lt;/a>. I have serious doubts that the increases in aid will end up as food in bellies – except for (maybe) those that are working in Daadab where it is a bit more straight-forward to deliver and where there is some semblance of oversight. Also there are fundamental structural problems with the way aid agencies (including NGOs and UN organs) are built and work. See &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/p7M6aZ">here&lt;/a> for a great discussion of this (but rather technical if you’re not into the biz of aid/development). The summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In summary, a major reason why aid agency presence has not translated into reduced vulnerability to, for example, famine, is due to aid agencies not being geared to do just that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Aid agencies do not build their programs around context, but are influenced by donor interest, assumptions, internal capacity and their own models of approach.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aid agencies don’t have resources that can be quickly tasked from one mode of operation (development) to another (emergency response).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Aid agencies’ internal measuring systems do not hold them accountable to how well they reduce the risk of a disaster happening, only on how well they acheive project deliverables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And aid agencies own internal systems and staffing do not allow a seamless transition from a long-term development presence to an emergency response.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes, the international community has made many mistakes. But I do not believe that it is the role of the international community to lead at times like this. I strongly believe that the role of the international community is to support local efforts with materiale, technical assistance, logistics expertise, and funding. I am disheartened by the increasing frequency of calls for an intervention on the level of the 92/93 intervention which burst the New World Order bubble and ushered in a decade of UN futility as the world’s largest NGO body of political discourse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though it is true that the international community, US, UK, Italy, etc. are definitely not without fault, I’m terribly tired of the narrative which places the entirety of the blame on these external parties. An example is here, where there is an entire, well written &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/quvuzF">post&lt;/a> by an educated Somali without the smallest hint of acceptance for any responsibility by the Somali community for what is happening (other than a few “criminals”). Here’s the crux of his argument.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If we had had foresight and acted upon it; if the Marines had disarmed the warlords; if the U.N. Security Council had issued arrest warrants for the warlords early on, stopping them from prolonging the failure of the state; if the Security Council had dealt with the warlords — who had denied starving millions access to food — speedily and decisively, in the same way it dealt with the genocidal regimes in Serbia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan, then al-Qaeda would not have established a secure base from which to plan terrorist attacks. Our country would not have been hamstrung by the enormity of our problem, nor would it have become the world’s worst humanitarian disaster.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A friend on G asked me a good question:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I would be interested if anybody knows some more details on the reason Al-Shabab has refused to let the aid organisations in. I mean, no matter what they publicly say, I am sure they feel the pressure of famine too. So why is it not possible to find some kind of middle ground? Are the NGOs reluctant to give up control over food deliveries? If yes, is that justified? &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/p3m5eU" title="Peter Dorrie on Google Plus">~Peter Dorrie&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My answer was that that’s part of it. Another big part of it is donor restrictions on supporting terrorist organizations. It is difficult to say with any certainty what Shabaab’s position is as they are terribly decentralized and non-uniform. Their position isn’t terribly rational but it is basically isolationist (like N.Korea, Taliban, Myanmar, etc.). They came to power on an anti-invaders platform and largely have kept to that meme throughout. On top of their irrationalities on banning bras, samosas, music, and anything that is fun, the group is funadamentally more nationalistic than it is Islamist (which is why I have always questioned the depth of their linkages with an Arab-led organization like Al-Qaeda).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are other things in play. According to &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/rpMQUy">this&lt;/a> article which examines this in a bit more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The first point I would make is that al Shabab is minimizing the crisis because, as many observers and experts are saying, the movement itself likely made the famine worse. Famines often (always?) result not only from failed rains or population growth, but also government policies, especially denial and inaction. . . . Every indication points to the conclusion that al Shabab not only fit into this regional trend [of refusing to recognize or limiting acknowledgement of the extent of a drought/famine because it highlights the ruling organization's shortcomings or racism], but was – because of its limited resources, its preoccupation with the civil war, and its ideology – a particularly bad offender.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My second thought is that when looking at al Shabab’s hostility to outsiders, it is worthwhile to try to understand the movement’s thinking from the inside. . . . The movement is made up mostly of young men (its name, after all, is Arabic for “the youth”), many of whom were children, or were not even born yet, when the Somali state collapsed in 1991. They have only known war and instability. They have seen weak would-be central governments come and go, they have seen clan rivalry tear at the social and political fabric of the country, and they have seen a parade of external actors, some of whom, like Ethiopia when it occupied Somalia from late 2006 to early 2009, carried out massive violence. Growing up in that environment would brutalize many people and make them deeply suspicious of outsiders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the famine strikes directly at the relationship between al Shabab and its constituents. The movement is taking a huge risk if it tries to solve this problem through violence and denial. Al Shabab controls territory, and so it must have some local support – support that is likely based in large part on al Shabab’s ability to offer some security and stability after years of fighting. Allowing the famine to go unchecked could destroy whatever local legitimacy al Shabab possesses, potentially resulting in infighting, fragmentation, rebellions, or desertions. From this perspective, it is not difficult to see why al Shabab originally decided to re-admit external aid agencies. And yet it now seems that paranoia and suspicion of outsiders are winning out in the leadership’s thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For an aid worker’s perception of this see &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r9qxK6">this&lt;/a> great article by &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pUP9XF">@morealtitude&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An invitation from al Shabbab central command may sound like a good enough reason to think aid workers would be safe re-entering south-central, but in fact it isn’t. Like many insurgency groups, al Shabbab is as much a network of affiliated warlords as it is a hierarchical paramilitary organization. Fighters on the ground- the ones with guns, grenades and IEDs- will align themselves first with their local commander, and only after that with al Shabbab central. Then there’s the assumption that the message is even getting down to those field grunts and their captains. Or the notion that some 16-year-old with an AKM, who’s never been to school but has spent the last ten years being told that westerners are pillaging his country and deserve to die, will pay any attention to some recent order from someone he’s never heard, when he sees an NGO Land Cruiser drive past.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="thought-4-the-role-of-somalis">Thought 4: The Role of Somalis&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Through all that I’ve read, I am most heartened by the diaspora involvement. Pull up &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oIgTvU">#feedsomalia&lt;/a> and you’ll see lots of activity. New, caring diaspora members are increasing their networks and ability to influence. This is a long-term positive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the immediate causes of the crisis have been the drought and insecurity in the south, there is something more fundamental at play here. &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/rdLcUg">This&lt;/a> article digs a bit beyond the boilerplate rhetoric.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Drought is not a new environmental condition for much of Africa but a recurring one. The semi-arid Horn of Africa and the entire Sahelian region — running just south of the Sahara Desert across the continent — have long experienced erratic rainfall. While climate change may be exacerbating rainfall variability, traditional livelihoods in the region are adaptable to deal with situations when rainfall is not dependable. . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditionally, herders ranged widely across the landscape in search of better pasture, focusing on areas as meteorological conditions dictated. The approach worked because, unlike fenced-in pastures in North America, it was incredibly flexible and adapted to variable rainfall. As farming has expanded, including in some instances to large-scale commercial farms, the routes of herders have become more concentrated and more vulnerable to drought. [Note, the conflict between the pastoralists and agriculturalists is one of the many, many causes of insecurity in the south.] . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as death from exposure is not an inherent result of a cold winter, famine is not a natural consequence of drought. Simply put, the structure of human society often determines who is affected and to what degree.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Fundamentally, the core of the problem is a breakdown of the social redistribution networks which are a basis of Somali culture (see Somaliland’s reaction described above). The diaspora &lt;em>should&lt;/em> be taking the lead, as they are much closer to the realities of the situation than the US Representative for Somalia (we don’t have an ambassador any longer) is to the situation. The more Somali community leaders take charge, accept the situation, and work towards a solution – the faster the entire situation (meaning more than the famine which is temporary) will stabilize and improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more on the diaspora’s efforts, see &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/n5pN4r">here&lt;/a> (among other &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oIgTvU">places&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="thought-6-starvation-porn">Thought 6: Starvation Porn&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/prWxac">Poverty/Starvation Porn&lt;/a> is very real and am happy that it is being talked about outside of the echo chamber of the “aid bloggers/tweeters” (for lack of a better label). There have been some great &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/om4GAY">articles&lt;/a> which have challenged the ethics of this type of coverage, which have come out of the situation. Here’s his punch-line:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Because it’s a cycle. African governments know that drought is coming and they don’t prepare. Foreign charities working there talk about long-term plans to help people become self-sufficient but they’ve been failing to achieve them for 20 years. It’s as much about politics and war and poor economic policies as it is about no rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m no expert but I know that much. I also know it’s wrong that every few years we’re faced with an “emergency” that could have been prevented, that aid groups must frantically try to raise money to respond to, that journalists need to find emaciated babies at death’s door and film and photograph and write about them before the world gives a damn.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>While there &lt;em>is some&lt;/em> value in showing the extent of suffering, it definitely skews the situation. While that is great marketing for aid organizations, as most of us who have worked in the developing world intuitively understand increases in aid flows do not necessarily end up as food in bellies or kids’ butts on school benches. As Haiti and Japan have shown there is an absorptive capacity formula to disaster relief whereby increases in aid can end up resulting in more rotten food or spoiled medicines rather than where it was intended. As &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/njzSQL">this&lt;/a> post from a former World Vision worker puts it, “Poverty is not an image, or a statistic; poverty has a face, a name and a story.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, most aid workers are quick to admit that there is a dualism to poverty porn as am sure they are quite happy with what they get in their bank account at the end of the month (and largely it is money that is well deserved as this is very hard work). But it is not easy to see what you’re working on cheapened by skewed coverage. Some of the ads for help, in particular the one on the Tumblr dashboard (can’t upload screenshot for some reason but at least the kids in the photo are smiling).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An aid worker / blogger who I have lots of respect for has put it this way in &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/p7M6aZ">this article&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Articles are starting to look like a fill-the-blanks template that the reporters are all sharing around: Quote some stats about the famine; talk about the complicating factor of al Shabbab making life difficult in Somalia; drop in some pithy quotes about the fact that short-term aid is repetitive and doesn’t solve the underlying problems (always with a nod to the fact that, well, of course it saves lives now); then end on the dark yet hopeful twist that while aid agencies clearly don’t have it right, clearly what’s needed is ‘long-term solutions’. Yeah, cool, thanks. . . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what I’m really ratty about is not that what the media are saying is wrong &lt;em>per se&lt;/em>. My problem is, they’re making noise but missing the point. . . . [Point 1] By rabbiting on about long-term solutions (I’m sorry, what solutions did you suggest, exactly?), they make it sound like nobody’s ever come up with that idea before. . . . Point two is, these solutions aren’t simple in the real-world.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="thought-7-what-can-be-done--what-can-you-do">Thought 7: What Can Be Done / What Can You Do&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Military intervention is about the worst solution human minds could conjure. History should be a lesson here. Somalis are phenomenal at skewing international interventions intended to help as invasions of their sovereignty. And in general Somalis are pretty duplicitous as to outsiders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second worst idea to me is trying to deliver via trucks and ground workers within the Shabaab zones. I fundamentally disagree that the US Gov should “work with Shabaab” as &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r1eFZk">this&lt;/a> article by Richard Dowden of the Royal African Society argues. This is a golden opportunity for the Somalis to see the results of their acquiescence to Shabaab’s presence. The easiest thing one can learn from Somali history is that when they’re sick of you they’ll find a way to overthrow you. When the communities within the Shabaab zones get sick of them they will kick them out of those communities and I know if I was living in these communities I would certainly be pretty circumspect about Shabaab. Of course no one wants to stay “starve them out” as that is cruel and inhumane treatment, but delivery within Shabaab’s areas I am 64.8% sure will end in a worse situation than never going in. As &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pUP9XF">@morealtitude&lt;/a> put it &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r9qxK6">here&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Letting aid workers in solves many problems for al Shabbab. It demonstrates to its own people that it’s taking steps to solve the problem. It helps slow the outflux of refugees. It brings in resources that bolster the population- which may be appropriated by fighters at times, or the effects may be indirect, such as more money in the economy that supports fighters’ families which in turn supports them. And, if aid agencies don’t do the right thing by al Shabbab, it gives them fresh ammunition in the polarizing of its people against the west.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Not increasing aid at all within Somalia is the best possible solution in my mind. The best option within Somalia is to stay out of the diaspora’s way with respect to their remittance flows into Somalia so people can purchase from local markets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was talking the other day with a few friends who work in this area. They told me that the real heart-break is that after people have trekked to the refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia they are finding that the food isn’t there. In these refugee camps there is a host government who is not impeding the delivery of aid and there is a relatively well-trekked cow-path for the logisticians to follow. Increasing the flows to these areas is a relatively straight-forward process and will ease one of the main problems while staying away from the quagmire.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next best options are to work through Somali NGOs and increase the flows that they are delivering, continue and maybe increase the &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/r7VE6P">air drops&lt;/a> (although these have to be terribly costly from a utilitarian point of view, and finally increase more traditional types of delivery within Mogadishu which the TFG / AMISOM troop relatively control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to give here are some organizations (in the order I would give to them if I had disposable income and wasn’t already fully invested in Somalis):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/qdaZLT">MSF&lt;/a> (Doctors without Borders who provide extensive medical care in the refugee camps)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/rgGS3S">Save the Children&lt;/a> (who have been working in the camps since the beginning)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/ojJQ0R">OXFAM-AUS&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/qCEFxc">OXFAM-UK&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/n7LClH">OXFAM-US&lt;/a> (Who also provides water and other services in the camps)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pfIBe4">IRC&lt;/a> (Who provides a number of services within the refugee camps)&lt;/li>

The first post in the series, the introduction is available &lt;a href="http://www.caseykuhlman.com/entry/somalilands-recognition-journey" title="What Does it Mean to be Independent: Somaliland’s Recognition Journey">here&lt;/a>. One of the legal criteria for statehood is established borders. There is a serious and very well, although often, hidden question as to where Somaliland’s borders are. In this post I try to parse this a bit mainly from the perspective of international law, but also from the political perspective as well.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My friend, and fellow Somaliland voyeur, Rudie made some very interesting and important points in the comments to my previous point. One of which was:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The AU for instance has a declared policy that colonial borders will be the norm for independence. I think this was to prevent states splitting up in small tribal entities. That would create chaos due to the haphazard way in which colonial borders were drawn with no respect for tribal territories, dividing tribes between countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>But before I get to that point of policy, let me put on my lawyer hat for a second (which looks amazing like a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/compleatang">cowboy hat&lt;/a> when you live in an anarchical state).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-international-criteria-for-statehood">The International Criteria for Statehood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are clearly defined baseline criteria for a state to be considered a state under international law. The first is a definable population; the second is a definable territory; the third is a government; and the fourth is the capacity to enter relations with other states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three of these criteria were first stated in the book, Allgemeine Staatslehre (General Theory of the State), published in 1900 by Georg Jellinek  which would put them in the classification of international law of “opinions of reknowned jurists” (which is the layman’s term, it has an official term from the Vienna Convention but I’m too lazy to look it up). This is a law classification and can easily be trumped or changed by higher classifications of international law which conflict with the opinions. However, as with much of international law (and indeed, with law in general) the opinions of jurists form and shape the “real” (known to lawyers as “positive”) law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what happened was later, in 1933, a regional treaty was passed which took into account the three criteria which were originally stated by Jellinek. was the &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pjgrt0">Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States&lt;/a>, which was a treaty concluded by the Organization of American States. Since that time, these four baseline criteria have become so well understood and highly utilized that they have allegedly become fully integrated into international law and adopted by most of the world’s states. Article 1 of that convention state the four criteria listed above.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="montevideo-criteria-2definableterritory">Montevideo Criteria #2: Definable territory.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I must say, when I was doing some quick background research for this post that I learned something. The criteria for borders is less stringent than I originally thought. At least legally speaking. What the International Court of Justice (the World’s Supreme Court for matters such as these), requires is that there be a core territory (see North Sea Case, p. 32, para. 46). If there is a region of the territory which is disputed that is not a hindrance to statehood (see German Gas v. Poland, 5 A.D. 11 at 15). At least legally speaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I keep saying, “at least legally speaking” for a reason. Here’s the bottom line, just because a geographic area meets the criteria for statehood, does not mean that recognition is automatic. Why? Politics. Politics and law are very often intertwined (for they are two sides of the same coin). There is likely no major sector of law where politics are more intertwined than they are with international law. And even within international law, there is perhaps no norm where politics and law are &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/nBwhVz">more intertwined&lt;/a> than when it comes to recognition.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="politics-lens-1-the-african-unions-declaration-of-respect-for-colonial-borders">Politics Lens #1: The African Union’s Declaration of Respect for Colonial Borders&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the 1960′s the US wasn’t the only territory worried about domino’s falling. The rapidly gaining independence African states were also worried about this. For those who may not fully understand African politics, let me simplify most African states are arbitrary maps on lines which were negotiated far from the ground itself. Largely there are two effect to this: (1) people who identify in very different ways have been haphazardly lumped together for no logical reason other than they traditionally resided near one another, and (2) people who identify in very similar ways have often been separated by international borders which they were given no part in making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are not small problems. They are still causing many, many problems throughout the continent. No matter the problems, the AU made a declaration long ago which basically froze the borders the way they were at the end of the colonial period. Why? Hard to say completely, but I suspect it was a devil you know v. devil you don’t know situation. At the end of the day there was a slippery slope argument that the politicians had to quelch. If one tribe, clan, or nation was given its independence within the colonial borders, the massive number of self-identifying entities within Africa would have demanded similar treatment and chaos would have ensued. Or so goes the theory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time the AU has tightly held this norm. South Sudan challenges this norm directly as it is the first state within Africa which very clearly violates this.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="politics-lens-2-outsourcing-decisions-to-the-african-union">Politics Lens #2: Outsourcing Decisions to the African Union&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Quite a while ago now, both the US and the UK, publicly stated that they would follow the AU’s lead when it came to Somaliland. Before I came here I thought this was a good thing. It represented to me, at that time, that the US and the UK were forcing the AU to act like a grown up regional organization and would allow it to take the diplomatic lead on this issue. Publicly at least, I have seen no retraction as to this policy – as applied to the Somaliland situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="facts-on-the-ground">Facts on the Ground&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="factual-lens-1-borders-from-the-somaliland-perspective">Factual Lens #1: Borders from the Somaliland Perspective&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Somalilanders feel very strongly that they meet the Montevideo Criteria #2 without violating the AU’s declaration of respect for colonial borders. Remember Somaliland was a sovereign nation for five days in 1960 (ironically enough, the first state to recognize them during that era was Israel). So Somalilanders say, we have defined borders. And they are the borders of the Somaliland Colony (or Protectorate, which Rudie challenged me on and I haven’t yet had a chance to dig up the answer from my history books here at the office). Case shut.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="factual-lens-2-borders-from-the-puntland-perspective">Factual Lens #2: Borders from the Puntland Perspective&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I don’t really know if there is a legal basis to Puntland’s argument, but Puntland does claim the far eastern regions of Somaliland as belonging to it. The border (as Somalilanders see it) does indeed run straight through the middle of a major Somali clan’s traditional homeland, so Puntland’s argument makes sense from a socio-cultural perspective, but I am not sure what their legal basis is. This divergence of opinion is the source of border scuffles which ebb and flow still.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This disputed region, according to the ICJ, does not hinder Somaliland’s statehood quest. At least legally. I suspect, it is a very real world hindrance. Why? One word. Eritrea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eritrea’s “break-away” from Ethiopia in the early 1990′s was not dissimilar to what Somaliland needs to accomplish. It was a unification that went awry and the break-away state wanted to reinstate its borders upon independence. The problem was that no one really knew where the border was and Ethiopia and Eritrea ended up fighting a semi-protracted war over the region which required the international community to come in, clean it up, and keep the peace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, the borders are very likely a very real thing in the minds of diplomats sitting at desks in Nairobi and Addis writing their home governments analysis memos about Somaliland’s recognition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, the Somaliland army does occupy almost the entirety of the territory. It doesn’t really control it, but it’s there and it’s doing the best it can with what little resources it has. The problem isn’t really from the Somaliland-Puntland perspective as much as it is from the perspective of the local people. Many of whom put up Puntland flags in their houses and claim to “not know Somaliland.” Somaliland has literally bent over backwards, giving portions of the governance sector way out of per capita proportions to clans from the East. It has attempted, when it can, to sink money into the East. It is actively encouraging development and aid agencies not only to work in the “triangle” but to also work further east. At the end of the day, the area we’re talking about would make Deadwood look like modern Stockholm in comparison. It is L A W L E S S. See &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/oYVYij">here&lt;/a> for news from this week about what happens in this area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I have heard Somalilanders often claim that if recognition comes to Somaliland that the eastern clans would “come around” and support Somaliland. Behind close doors, in the majlises that I visit and sit with Somalilanders, most readily admit that it isn’t that simple. The eastern clans have traditionally been among the rules of Somalis overall. One of their major clans has a long a history of being politicians as the Isaaqs (Somaliland’s far-majority clan) have of being traders and business people. Another of their major clans was the clan of the former dictator, Siad Barre. So it isn’t quite a simple matter for them to subservient themselves to the Isaaq. Puntland (where the same clans which are in eastern Somaliland completely occupy), if it were to become a sovereign nation, would be in an awful position resource-wise. They have &lt;em>very&lt;/em> little resources to speak of. The areas they claim in Somaliland are said to be decent (if not great) grazing areas and are said to have a decent amount of minerals including perhaps hydrocarbon deposits. So it isn’t a simple matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was talking with a friend on Thursday about this issue and basically we could agree that the area is likely more trouble than it is worth. So I posited why doesn’t the President just cede the area to Puntland and let them deal with the problems. After it left my mouth I realized instantly why Somaliland can never do that: they would then be rewriting the colonial borders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where the South Sudan precedent may be of assistance to Somaliland. If the AU either restricts or abolishes its declaration of respect for colonial borders, or at a minimum creates some exceptions, then Somaliland could potentially allow the area to go to Puntland and still argue that it meets the criteria for statehood. That is incredibly far-fetched I know, but it could be an option at least.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Up next: population&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After having been in Somaliland, one of the world’s most advanced unrecognized countries, for well over three years I have thought much about what it means to be a state, to have your independence, to maintain your sovereignty and many related issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short, Somaliland’s history breaks down like this. Somaliland (now) was known before as British Somaliland and as any astute reader may be able to understand from the glaring connotations it was a British colony. What is now the rest of Somalia (known together as Puntland and South-Central for those of us who work on and/or live in the territory of the former Republic of Somalia) was at the same time known as Italian Somaliland. In 1960 when independence movements were sweeping the world (in the US we just called them the civil rights movements, in Africa they were “real” independence movements), Both of the former colonies received their independence within 5 days of each other in the summer of 1960. British Somaliland was a stand-alone entity for five days, afterward it formed a union with the former Italian colony based upon the notion that all five of the Somali areas (modern-day Djibouti, eastern Ethiopia, Somaliland, the former Italian colony, and the North-Eastern part of Kenya) would unite to form a republic for the Somali people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things didn’t end up turning out as the Somali elites at the time had hoped. The French did not give up Djibouti until much later. Ethiopia and Kenya were worried about their hetergenous populaces and if they allowed the Somalis to break away each of the tribes or nations within their countries would demand similar treatment. The US wasn’t the only one in the 1960′s worried about Domino Effects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Northerners (formerly British Somalilanders, who currently identify as Somalilanders), though leading the push for unification with the South were mismatched and could not compete for their pro rata places throughout the elite of Somali society. They ended up being dominated in almost every facets of country-wide politics by (to them) outsiders and they were not given the opportunity to participate properly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a long series of events the Northerners formed a rebel group in the mid- / late-1980s (depending on how you classify “formed”) which was called the Somali National Movement. It was dominated by Northern elites, but its stated purpose was to overthrow the dictator of the time, Siad Barre. Again things did not turn out as the elites expected. The populace of the Northern tribes, after the SNM drove Siad’s forces (mostly) out of their region demanded that SNM “reinstate” the independence which the Northerners had gained when the British lowered their flags. The SNM leadership, reliant upon cash from the diaspora and the support of the local people for the continuation of their campaign against Siad, had no choice and complied with the demands of the people and “reinstate” their independence (alternatively known locally as “retract the unity with the south” or “declared independence”). That was 1991.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since 1991, Somalilanders have done an amazing amount. They have developed a tri-partite governance system based upon a US model of independent executive with a bicameral legislature. They have a flag, currency, a national anthem, customs officials, defined borders, national monuments, and every other outward hallmark of a state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But yet they have not been recognized as an independent, sovereign state by any entity in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/pxvnYK">South Sudan&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://wsl.so/rrYYLM">Libyan rebels&lt;/a> are being recognized by states and international organizations all over the world. Which begs the question why has this bastion of democracy and stability in an area much better known for pirates, terrorists, war lords, and downed helicopters not been given the diplomatic support of the “international community”?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those fresh off the planes to Egal International Airport in Hargeisa will often ask that question to their drivers, fixers, or staff directly. And they answers they receive vary from Nile politics, to Jewish conspiracies, to cynical disenfranchisement. My own thoughts differ from all of those theories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First the Libyan rebels situation is different, as explained in the link referenced above. This consortium of disparate groups is not trying to separate and form a new, unique republic but is trying to take over the entire country and overthrow a dictator (not dissimilar to the SNM’s original mission). The recognition given by the US, UK, French, and other big players in world politics is simply a recognition that they are the valid governing coalition for the entire geographical area and have the right to speak on behalf of the entire Libyan people. This shift from Qaddafi regime to the rebel regime is not terribly different than the diplomatic maneuverings which happened when Obama took over from Bush. Legally speaking at least. So that is a very different situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The South Sudan situation is much closer to the Somaliland situation, but it also has one very important difference. South Sudan fought a long, protracted war against the Bashir regime which resulted in a 2005 peace agreement. This peace agreement between the rebels now forming the basis of the South Sudan government and the Bashir regime allowed for the South to have a referendum vote on independence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is a substantial difference than the unilateral declaration by Somaliland of the “reinstatement” of its independence, at least diplomatically. Somaliland has yet to negotiate with the internationally recognized government down in Mogadishu the terms of its separation. Partially this is due to the animosity between the two. Partially this is due to the fact that no single entity has been in Mogadishu for very long with a sufficient amount of political power for Somaliland to be able to have anyone legitimate on the other side of such a bargaining table.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the Transitional Federal Government has made great strides towards stability recently, they still only occupy half of their capital city and outside of that have very little ability to impose their will. So therein lies the crux of the problem for Somalilanders. They are steadily building their own country, and have an entire generation who know only Somaliland and nothing about the Republic of Somaliland, meanwhile their appeals to the international community have fallen on deaf ears and they have no one in Mogadishu that for the foreseeable future they will be able to negotiate with the terms of their separation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are an incredible amount of layers to this onion and in future posts I hope to have the time to peel this back a bit further, but for tonight this will have to suffice.&lt;/p>

What Now?</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-05-02-ok-so-hes-gone-what-now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2011/2011-05-02-ok-so-hes-gone-what-now/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I woke up this morning to the news. Obama Killed Osama. In my groggy state, I couldn’t really piece together what was happening on my collated facebook and twitter streams until I saw something similar to the previous sentence. I think the first thing I cognized was a friend’s facebook post: “Osama, so 10 years ago.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went to NYTimes.com and saw the huge headline and the gigantic picture of the President staring at me, resolute &amp;amp; determined. After reading the article, and then watching my Twitter feeds more closely than usual today (which has been a busy one and not really allowed me to dig as deep into the commentary as I would like), I think my overall thought is, “Osama, so 10 years ago.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is actually quite amazing to consider that it was almost 10 years ago that I was sitting with my Marine infantry officer friends in our boxers and t-shirts watching GWB announce to the world that our nation’s military was on its highest alert and looking around the room thinking, “Huh?” as a typhoon raged outside and we couldn’t even leave the building. That was 9-11-01. This is 02-05-11 (date formats have been shifted in accordance with my mindset).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The news, while large, seems quaint. Many nations with majority muslim populations have bigger problems today, and they now have viable outlets for those problems. Moderate muslims the world over have increasingly spoken out against extremism (exhibit A is the commercial I watch on Qatar based MBC movie channel which shows a young teenager watching extremist videos and ends with his mom watching him on one crying and then flashes something in Arabic which I assume says, “don’t be an idiot and blow yourself up”). Al Qaeda has fractured, has become cellular and largely unable to organize anything beyond a small isolated bombing for a long time now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My main question as to what now has much less to do with the muslim majority areas and much more to do with America. Our shorthand for “the enemy” is gone. So what will we do now? It is very difficult to motivate people, populations, and most importantly fighters to fight a war where they cannot “see” the reason that they are fighting. Our reason in Iraq left, but there was still a face there that was lingering, hovering over the consciousness. That face is now at the bottom of the ocean. I think we can smile that an evil human has gone, but the real point, the real concern I have, or better put, the hope that I hold to is that we Americans can now get back to showing the world that we know more than how to fight. That we know how to compete, how to build, how to innovate, how to drive progress, how to balance divergent political interests, how to develop systems which bring jobs and health and education. Let those be our exports. Instead of our current portfolio: facebook, google, and guided missiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Concisely put by my friend: “Osama. So 10 Years Ago.”&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I read an interesting article yesterday from a man who I referenced in my previous post as one of my favorite development bloggers: Owen Barder. Owen has joined a DC based development think-tank called Center for Global Development and in his [good-bye to Ethiopia post][2] he had an interesting thing to say about aid. He claims, and I heartily support, that development is much broader than simply aid, it is about trade policy, climate policy, monetary policy (which he didn’t actually mention), and numerous other policies which the developed world implements and in the globalized economy has massive effects in the developing world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.caseykuhlman.com/entry/why-i-started-watershed/4928948235_9882789b97">http://www.caseykuhlman.com/entry/why-i-started-watershed/4928948235_9882789b97&lt;/a>
[2]: &lt;a href="http://www.owen.org/blog/4540">http://www.owen.org/blog/4540&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article returned my thoughts to something which I have pondered off and on for the eight months since we have opened the doors on &lt;a href="http://watershedlegal.com">Watershed Legal Services&lt;/a>, my small law firm in this corner of the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are an assortment of varied and divergently relevant reasons why I invested my time and money in this entity. It is a hodge-podge, a kaleidoscope which changes its predominant colors over time. For one, I wanted to get off the NGO train, to stop skimming the surface of places and to dig into a country. To plant roots. For another, my marriage wasn’t going to thrive in an environment where we were constantly moving as my wife is also a professional and the chances of two professionals finding professionally satisfying positions in a new country every two or three years was daunting at best. And I simply fell in love with Somalis and Somaliland – despite (or perhaps because of) its craziness, its madness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those are mainly all personal reasons, but there were also some professional reasons which I have considered at length. Rightly or wrongly I was tired of a culture of giving. Now that is not to say that I have stopped giving, indeed I cannot count the number of pro bono hours that our small firm has performed in our short life. I am not tired of giving, I am tired of the expectation that I am here to give – full stop. I am tired of a culture where nothing will happen without a body with money external to the state saying yes we will  fund that. These are backwards to how I see the world. I have no problems with giving a man a fish. But when there are so many fish givers in a place that the giving of a fish becomes an expectation then I think we have reached a point where things should be reevaluated. It isn’t development, it isn’t sustainable, and something has to give. This is why I was excited to start a for-profit law firm, this is why we don’t chase projects in the same way that NGOs do, this is why we haven’t taken outside funding from foundations or other organizations who have shown willingness to assist organizations such as Watershed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Law is not something that can be given. It is, at its core, a conversation between power centers. This conversation ebbs and flows over time. It changes and must change in order to have life and to enable its success. While it is a conversation which can often be informed by actors abroad, if it is not a conversation within the society in which it is being imposed, it will never be successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me put some meat on that paragraph. What I see from the other side of the table now that I have switched from a legal reform NGO to a practitioner within the country is a tangled mess of laws which will never be implemented here. I see laws built by consultants from other countries who have never bothered to learn the legal structures of this country and bring their own governance proclivities with them. The simple fact of a Kenyan consultant coming to Somaliland to write a law brings big troubles because until recently Kenya was a fundamentally British parliamentary system. Those types of governments operate in a fundamentally different way than governments on a different part of the spectrum. Somaliland, in contradistinction, is built upon an American model. You cannot simply take ideas of how the conversations between power centers works in one system and transplant them whole sale into a different system. Yes, there are often analogies, but not always. American notions of the separation of power and the reasons that America has been able to make an independent executive work requires a method of thought which differs in so many ways. It is like comparing how you talk to your close friends over a cup of coffee sitting on their couch to how you would talk to a new business associate. You talk fundamentally different because the social modes which develop around each of those situations is vastly different. The same is true about law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So really it boils down to the fact that I wanted to help Somaliland develop its own way of conversing. I want to stop consultants coming from other countries dropping off finished laws and running away. I want to assist parliament and the government to learn how to converse with each other in a legal sense. I want to give young, sharp lawyers a chance to move beyond a simple contract for an NGO where they will never be pushed where they will stagnate and never have the chance to have the feeling of a bit of hard work pushed out the door and the ultimate relaxation and joy which follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That, my friends, is why I do what I do. That, my friends, is why I’m more professionally satisfied in these recent months than I’ve ever been in my life.&lt;/p>

Closed for people. by BlueRobot @ flickr">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week two interesting articles (to me) have been published and they have given me the push to return to commenting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The articles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first was an &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704425804576220524034207558.html">Op-Ed&lt;/a> that was recently published by a publication which is not exactly known for its do-gooder tendencies, the WSJ. It was written by a man I know of, but surprisingly have never run into in the very small expat community we have here in Hargeisa, Jonathon Starr. It was a rage against the machine of the aid industrial complex, something that I can generally get behind. There were parts of the article I agreed with and parts which I disagreed with. Jonathon attacks aid, which is his right – even though I would argue he is an outsider. I am unimpressed by some his more self-righteousness (I took no salary and expect my staff to do the same). He also makes the general broad-side attack of an industry that is very much fodder for an Op-Ed but lacks the detail and bite of a genuine argument which make me think and reflect. The basic gist of the article is that aid is fundamentally flawed because the lack of a profit motive therein causes inefficiencies in its delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://talesfromethehood.com/2011/04/18/big-business/">second&lt;/a> was a response to Jonathon’s piece by one of my favorite aid-bloggers, J, who maintains the &lt;a href="http://http://talesfromethehood.com/">Tales from the Hood&lt;/a> blog (as well as the uber hilarious &lt;a href="http://stuffexpataidworkerslike.com">Stuff Expat Aid Workers Like&lt;/a>). J does not have the nicest take on what Jonathon originally wrote. He attacks Jonathon as an outsider who never learned about aid (a meme that he often comes back to and one in which I only partially buy). But more to the point, he defends aid by saying that it should not be run as a business.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-thoughts">The thoughts.&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I would enjoy a response from Jonathon to J.  But in the event (a phrase I am increasingly enjoying), I think that if a discussion were to develop they may be arguing past each other. I have a decent understanding of what Jonathon is doing here. It is a small town, and even smaller where the expats are concerned; as with all small towns, we’re in each other’s business to the point of dysfunction. What he is doing is not really what I would classify as aid work. That is to say, it isn’t NGO work as I would classify such. I would call it non-profit work. I make this distinction because Jonathon isn’t really struggling with the same things that most people I know who are EAWs struggle with. It is a subtle distinction, running a program focussed on opening schools and opening a school, but it is a distinction nonetheless. I should clarify this more but it is getting late and I’m lazy. Let us leave it at this: the scale, the tensions, the accounting, the partners – all of these are very different. That aside, Jonathon is clearly an intelligent man and whether he lacks or possesses epistemic authority as an insider to back his argument he originally crafted it and I would hope that he is willing to engage, defend, respond, and converse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think they both could agree on one point, and it is a point which &lt;a href="http://owenabroad.com">Owen Barder&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/">Duncan Green&lt;/a> have made eloquently. Owen has made it numerous times, and &lt;a href="http://www.owen.org/blog/4018">here&lt;/a> is one example. I cannot seem to find Duncan’s, but I remember he has written at least one very good piece on it. The upshot of their argument is that aid is fundamentally lacking feedback mechanisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This, it seems to me, is what Jonathon was originally trying to say. He rightly identifies one of the major problems with aid (its lack of feedback), but he misplaces the meat of his argument by equivocating (wrongly I think) a profit motive with feedback. Yes, in some businesses the bottom line is one of the feedback mechanisms to show whether there is uptake of the goods or services. But the key is not the presence or absence of a profit motive, the key is the presence of ANY feedback loop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>J rightly defends some of the current state of aid affairs by saying that indeed aid is not business and some efforts to make it more business-like would be misplaced. Such a reformation would in many instances leave out the real points of aid which is delivery of services to under-serviced sectors – sectors which the profit driven world has, for whatever reason, missed. That would be precisely contrary to what the aid world should be doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning from different sectors is one thing. When I was a Marine, I knew others who got the opportunity to go be seconded to a big company or to the stock exchange for a year or so. They brought back with them their lessons learned and they improved some things within the Corps. And that was fine. That is simply organizational learning. But the reformation which Jonathon proposes is quite a different thing. I fail to see where the presence of a profit motive would truly affect the delivery of NGO services. I see for-profit clinics and schools all around me during my drive to work every day. And I also see tons of kids unable to afford those schools therefore playing in the streets at school time and old ladies too sick to walk to the clinic and unable to afford the clinics anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The profit motive is not what is wrong with aid. What is wrong with aid is that it has built into itself neither feedback loops nor accountability. I do not know of a single industry more isolated or insular than aid. There are those inside the echo chambers of twitter and blogs and they are each trying their best to improve the accountability and the feedback mechanisms, but the bottom line is that aid is an industry which is out of site and out of mind for everyone who is not an insider. And what incentive to any of the insiders have to change things other than simple altruism which is never a very powerful motivator? If aid fundamentally changed and if aid accomplished its mission many of the insiders would be out of jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And so the cycles spin and people (like J) scream how aid needs professionals in order for it to be delivered correctly. While I do not quibble with what he is saying, I think that outsiders need to engage more. I appreciate the courage which Jonathon displayed in making his original argument. The more outsiders disrupt, the more insiders disrupt, the more improvements we will hopefully see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are lots of spaces to fill. There are spaces which aid (at least of the international, relatively big-money variety) deserves to be, where it can properly fit and prosper. There are spaces where locally oriented non-profits deserve to be, where they can properly fit and prosper. And there are spaces where businesses should be. If each continues to share lessons learned and if there continues to be a good conversation between the many camps and factions then hopefully what we are all searching for, a reasonable chance for those we wee around us, will come ever closer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But let us not turn our comparisons of apples and oranges into app-ange juice because even though I have never drank that I’m not sure it would be delicious.&lt;/p>

The chance to take your now 6 year old new organization to the next level. AJE was a regional power, had a lot of money behind it, but is still banned in the US and largely doesn’t have the legitimacy of CNN and BBC. But this was their chance, and they absolutely nailed the coverage. It was spectacular in every way I can think of, and for all my friends I only wish you could have seen the narrative unfold.
The first night I paid attention to Egypt was Jan 28, the first Friday after it all began.  That was the day that everything seemed to blossom.  That was the day when the police cracked down but then were beaten down.  That was the day the army took to the streets and no one was sure how they would react.  That was the day that they shut down the internet.  So much happened.
From the balcony of AJE’s offices we watched the building of the ruling party burn, we watched a police APC stopped, tried to get thrown in the nile, and eventually burned in place (two weeks later I was awed by the continued presence of the carcass in a sweeping shot meant to show something else).
There are too many reasons why AJE’s coverage of Egypt was an absolute masterpiece of television and journalism, something that should be studied not only in journalism schools but also in film schools.  It was brilliant in its ability to capture the emotions of what was happening.
&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aljazeeraenglish/5413058725">![Egypt political crisis via Al Jazeera English @ flickr]({{ site.url }}{{ site.root }}{{ site.images_dir }}/{{ page.date | date: &amp;ldquo;%Y&amp;rdquo; }}/5413058725_d416628f87.jpg)&lt;/a>
On Thursday Mubarak spoke. The world watched in collective silence and about two or three minutes into the speech it became clear that he was entrenching himself.  Within about ten seconds of me hearing that, AJE slowly fed in the audio from Tahrir square where things were going nuts side by side with its translator continuing to do his thing.  It was subtle and it was brilliant.
[This NYT’s][3] article today compares their coverage to MSNBC and CNN and the others. It talks about another of the moments of brilliance. On Friday after Sulieman announced that Mubarak had stepped down the anchor simply said, “he’s gone.” And then it was just radio silence from talking.  All we saw and heard was sweeping shots of hundreds of thousands of people in the biggest celebration of their lives.  No words could describe it.

I know I’m in danger of fawning here, which is never attractive, but it is difficult to contain myself. The final thing that was so special about this coverage, was that most of the reporters that AJE brought in were Egyptian diaspora. They all had a personal stake in what was happening around them, but they never let that come through and color their commentary in any way. In the end the anchor had to force them, and even then as the NYT’s article says they were true human beings with some staying steadfastly professional, and some more emotional. Get yourself some of their good journalism (please, if only so I can watch it when I am back in the States as I’m not sure I can stand American news/punditry for more than about 30 seconds of its screaming overly emotional coverage of anything) by [clicking here][5] and putting in your zip code. And watch some of the videos.

The final thing I will say is this: [Ayman][6] [Mohyeldin][7] is now among my favorite reporters. They guy was absolutely unbelievable from the beginning to the end.

&amp;ldquo;THIS COULD HAVE BEEN STRAIGHT OUT OF A MOVIE! #jan25 #egypt&amp;rdquo; via Farrah3m @ Twitpic
Two days ago, my father asked me for my thoughts on the protests throughout the Arab world. I wanted to compose my thoughts, to let the situation develop a bit further before I said anything.  Now is the time to say something.
This is utterly fascinating to watch.  Al Jazeera is very much killing it with fantastic shots – news hasn’t captivated me in this same way since watching CNN from the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad in 1991.  On Friday I was sitting with my friends and we watched the following sequence unfold in real time: reports of police sending reinforcements into streets, video of police apcs flooding streets, video of protesters stopping one vehicle, video of  police scrambling and fighting their way out of back of vehicle protesters beating the driver, video of protesters trying and failing to tip apc over and “throw” into nile, reprieve, reports of army being called onto streets, video of apc being lit on fire, and for the next three hours they would every once in a while cut back to the same burning apc.  It was magical, riveting, unbelievable tv.
I was watching very closely when earlier (before the above sequence) a lone army apc came into the screen (was easy to tell as was painted different color, a fairly standard practice worldwide).  The people went utterly nuts.  And the army seemed to be cheering the protesters back.  It was pretty far away from the cameraman so it was difficult to see exactly, but it was super interesting.  That was before Mubarak called the army onto the streets.  The stoppage for the prayers was the other thing that fascinated me, but back to the army.  The Egyptian army is a conscript army, and it closer to the middle/lower classes than the police are, given that the police are not conscripts and are often hand chosen by the regime.
The story aside, what is my chat on this topic?  Three things strike me: (1) the interconnectedness of the pan-Arab movement may be among the causes of the downfall of the creators; (2) [Gladwell][2], you’re wrong; (3) the results of the variety of protests is going to differ, likely in proportion to GDP.
[2]: &lt;a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/04/101004fa_fact_gladwell&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pan-arab-movement">Pan-Arab Movement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes, all of these are connected.  The Tunis protests, and their subsequent victories, beget the Egyptian protests, and as they say: as Egypt goes, so goes the Arab world.  But look at what I pulled just a few minutes off of Twitter:
[![][4]][4]
[]: &lt;a href="http://www.caseykuhlman.com/entry/egypt-burning-arab-protests/scr">http://www.caseykuhlman.com/entry/egypt-burning-arab-protests/scr&lt;/a>
The protests just continue to spread: Sudan, Yemen, Syria, Algeria, Bahrain, Libya. The linkages that have been built, especially in the post-colonial world between the Arab nations, which was originally established as a bulwark against the West (among other reasons) is now making the spread of protest-ism violently, breathtakingly fast.
And yes, technology is helping to facilitate the spread.  I have seen[ twitpics of letters][4] from Tunisian protesters to Egyptian protesters with tips on how to fight the man.  Encouragement and organizing are all happening online.  Why else would Egypt completely pull the plug?
[4]: &lt;a href="http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2011/01/journal-example-of-open-source-tactical-innovation.html">http://globalguerrillas.typepad.com/globalguerrillas/2011/01/journal-example-of-open-source-tactical-innovation.html&lt;/a>
Third, and this is what is going to take longer to figure out.  But the end result of this wave, I suspect is going to distill rough correlative to GDP of the nations.  Tunisia and Egypt will likely see some fundamental changes.  Syria and Bahrain will likely see some changes, but not fundamental ones.  Libya, Sudan, and Yemen will likely have to wait a bit longer for fundamental changes within their countries.  I’m a Collier-ist and I am interested to see if this is going to validate his [theories ][5]that at about $3000 per capita GDP is some sort of a tipping point for democracy.  Thailand reached that and it beget massive protests, the countries listed above are there, China is approaching this threshold.  Yet, we will see.  Only after the fact will we see.

The last thing I’ll note is that a power vacuum in Egypt is in precisely no one’s interest.

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I know I am generalizing, but since many that I know and love subscribe to many of these philosophies maybe I do have a small bit of perspective here.  Let me take a look at the Free Market system and rules.  Many have argued that rules are inherrently anti-market.  That the opposite of capitalism is rule-making by regulators.  Maybe that is right in some areas, but I would argue that it depends on the specific area in mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“The big-government crowd is drawn to the compulsory nature of centralized authority. They can’t imagine an undirected social order. Someone needs to be in charge—someone who knows better. Big government is audacious and conceited. By definition, government is the means by which citizens are forced to do that which they would not do voluntarily. Like pay high taxes. Or redistribute tax dollars to bail out the broken, bloated pension systems of state government employees. Or purchase, by federal mandate, a government-defined health-insurance plan that is unaffordable, unnecessary or unwanted. For the left, and for today’s Democratic Party, every solution to every perceived problem involves more government—top-down dictates from bureaucrats presumed to know better what you need. Tea partiers reject this nanny state philosophy of redistribution and control because it is bankrupting our country.” ~Dick Armey &amp;amp; Matt Kibbe @ &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704407804575425061553154540.html">WSJ&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Despite universal acknowledgement that Americans enjoy a free, open, and vibrant Internet, the FCC is relentlessly pursuing a massive regulatory regime that would stifle broadband expansion, create congestion, slow Internet speeds, jeopardize job retention and growth, and lead to higher prices for consumers.” ~ Virginia Tea Party Patriot Federation letter to the FCC re: Net Neutrality, excerpted &lt;a href="http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/08/13/the-tea-party-hates-net-neutrality-because-its-an-affront-to-free-speech-umm/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>“Tea party members believe in this invisible hand spoken of by Adam Smith. Society is better off because of the free market. A person invents something so that they can make money, but in that self interest benefits society as a whole. Did the government invent the car, the computer, or airplane? Nope, self interested individuals invented these things. Did these inventions enrich society as a whole? Yes. Think about the amount of jobs created by the computer industry alone, everything these days (seemingly) has computer technology in it. Think about the amount of jobs created by the auto industry. When government steps into the free market it creates advantages for those it supports and disadvantages for those who is doesn’t support. The law of supply and demand has been tampered with, and the market is artificially manipulated. Sometimes these manipulations have a positive impact, only to come crashing back down. Most of the time they have a negative impact on the market.” ~ Available &lt;a href="http://hubpages.com/hub/what-the-tea-party-stands-for-free-markets">here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I actually really like what the Tea Partiers have been able to accomplish, although I am about as far away from them policy-wise as possible, I like the fact that they are shaking things up for the entrenched political interests on both sides of the aisle.  That said, I think they are dead wrong when it comes to their hatred and shunning of rules, so I’d like to take a little moment here and explain things from my side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about sports.  Particularly, think about football.  A lot of rules were made in football between the mid-80′s to mid-90′s which had to do with protecting the quarterback.  Why is this person special?  Likely it was less because of his primacy on the playing field, and more likely because of his primacy in the board room.  Fine, but when those rules were adopted I don’t remember (although maybe it happened) any pundits arguing for the demise of football as we know it.  They were saying, no we need some fair competition, and if I spend Y of my cap money on a quarterback, I should have the opportunity to let that investment play out.  There was still plenty of competition, not the least of which was during the off season for prime players.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then let’s look at the salary cap &amp;amp; profit sharing mechanism that the owners have set up.  If this was tried in Washington it would have about a 0% chance of surviving a first draft and whoever the unlucky sap was that had the job of writing a first draft would be instantly shunned as a communist.  But when it comes to our beloved sport we say how great it is that small market teams like Pittsburgh still have the same chance of surviving as big market teams like New York.  Indeed big markets haven’t dominated football in ages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compare this to baseball.  That is the sport, for those of you who may remember, with the sticks and the balls and the clay in a diamond with a bunch of people basically standing around all the time.  There were two major turnoffs for many I know from my generation about baseball (besides it’s boring which I would argue against).  (1) “In baseball you can just go out and buy your team.  There is no thrill in just zero to winning.” It wasn’t satisfying when the Marlins bought a team and won the World Series in the late nineties.  Not at all satisfying.  (2) “They absolutely turned a blind eye to the steroid situation.”  Well, there you have it folks, rules (football) v. non-rules (baseball).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us talk NASCAR.  I grew up watching Dale Earnhartt, Bill Elliot, and those guys.  I was a number 3 guy.  I went to the Dayton 500 and remember the after effects of a fantastic Ricky Rudd accident that is still likely shown on best 100 crashes of all time on late night Spike TV.  What do people like about NASCAR?  What I liked about it is that the competition is based on pure skill.  It is pure skill in driving, and it is pure skill in engineering.  But engineering in the fine-tune sense.  The driver with the fastest car (interpret: has built the most efficient system) who is the best driver on that day (interpret: has great adaptability) most of the time wins.  It is fast and loud and visciously entertaining to go to the races.  But really races boil down to (besides keeping your hipster appeal by “making fun of the white trash people.”) a human struggle to best their machine and their elements.  But if you want to talk about systems with rules, the NASCAR rule book is lots of pages long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So rules, in and of themselves do not serve to stifle competition.  They often serve, instead, to shift power away from entrenched interests (NY Yankees) towards more of a meritocratic environment.   I’m all for rules if they allow two things: (1) lower barriers to entry (and no, it doesn’t matter to me if that comes at the cost of entrenched interests or people/entities with bigger bankrolls than I) and (2) promotes a meritocratic environment.  Those are the essential parts of the American dream which I hold onto.  I do not begrudge anyone their own perspectives and values that they hold on to, but those are the ones I hold as truisms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is also why I &lt;a href="http://watershedlegal.com/about">work with small businesses here in Somaliland&lt;/a>.  If you want to know the effects of zero rule making look here.  When people want to see how a society (which isn’t much different than an American one – a coming post) operates under anarchical situations pick up a book and see what is happening (beyond the terrorism) in the three different major areas of Somalia – each with a progressively more mature rule-making capability.  And then compare those with a more advanced rule making capability of neighboring Ethiopia.  You can draw a distinct and direct correlation between stability, progress, and rule-making authority.  The most anarchical is the least developed.  The least anarchical is the most developed.  And in those sentences I’m conflating anarchy as an antonym of exercised rule-making authority of a government.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>She looked at my passport and flipped, and flipped, and flipped, and flipped. “Wow, you’ve been to a lot of places,” she said with fully disclosed jealousy.  Which at first I thought was odd.  Four years ago her accent alone would have seemed exotic, enticing, other.  Now she appeared to be just another worker trying to get by.  I glanced up from my Twitter scanning on my mobile and said without a pause the above reflection may suggest, “yeah, I’ve been to lots of the world’s shit holes.”   She laughed, and I felt sheepish at the arrogance which the comment may have implied.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>OK, I know where all the smoking bars are in Schipol.  I’m no longer surprised by the ridiculous, inefficient Heathrow monstrosity.  I’ve seen the super-efficient Germans’ achievements in process engineering at their militant, rule-loving best (that is, airports).  And don’t get me onto the shit holes where you step out of the secure area (if it exists) into a accosting of a wave of heat, humidity and noise – so much clammer and “taxi.”  I cannot tell you my mobile number at any given moment, but I can tell you my passport number, its issue date and its expiration date.  Along with my social security number and my best friend Joe’s parent’s home phone number these are the only strings of digits I seem to care to recall these days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I packed my bags this time to return “home” to Somaliland I sighed and realized consciously, for the first time and perhaps temporarily, that I am dead fed up with traveling.  It isn’t so much the hassle of it all.  Even flying to Somalia is more or less straight-forward these days.  Carrying briefcases around airports isn’t vastly different than carrying them to the office.  I didn’t really turn the why over in m y mind too much as I was a bit hurried getting out the door.  The answer, now that I have had a bit of time, or at least part of the answer may be found here:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I walked down the stairs not really paying much attention.  I like to walk around airports with my headphones noise-canceling and L O U D to hear only the soundtrack to the assorted visions of ridiculosity that are most airports.  My personal montage bereft of gate change announcements and banal banter.  PSYCOLGIE – it screamed from its red perch on a glossy white background.  A magazine on psychology given prime placement is an oddity wherever you go.  ”Maybe I should get that for Brian (aka @worldliness).”  ”What the hell would he want with that?”  ”Maybe he’d like it since he is into psychology and it is from elsewhere.”   “But he can’t read it. What’s he going to do with it – hang it on the wall?” “True” I conceded to my sarcastic self while striding along past, another in the varied imagery of the montage.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here’s the rub: foreign crap is still crap.  Somehow, and I blame the subjects of Mad Men’s brilliant meanderings, we all have mostly had this fascination with travel.  The glamor, the otherness, the newness to it all.  But everywhere I go, I find people that are more or less the same as many of those I’ve known back home or in other places I’ve lived.  Indeed, I have increasingly come to the conclusion that any group of 5-10k people will have (within obvious allowances) about the same mixture of personality types and if transferred to an entirely new environment and given an entirely new set of problems and collective history – the groups would more or less act in the same manner (again, within allowances).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which reminds me of a Scooby Doo episode which somehow always terrified me as a youngster where the gang awoke in a place that looked exactly like the place they went to sleep in, except it was haunted!  Zoiks.  Therein was my introduction to parallel universe theory.  Indeed, for most of us we want the same things.  A family, friends, and a community we like, love and respect. Good health. Stable lifestyle. The illusion that things will be “better” for our kids (although I’m skeptical of the latter, and wonder often what “better” really constitutes).  We want to laugh, to each, to hug a partner, to do our thing – whatever that may be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is nothing particularly exotic about any place I’ve been. There may be beautiful vistas but those I’ve seen in any country I’ve been to, and some of the best are back home (but, of course, I’m biased). There may be beautiful people – but there are always ugle people too. At the end of the day, it boils down to this: &lt;em>see id.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Does the dystopic flattening of the world into a melancholy riff on the khackiness mean that I’m done?  That I’m off the crazy train I’ve been on since I left home at 18 to my first new place and new environment where I knew no souls? Doubtful. I still love to see new vistas – wherever they may be. I’m still seeking good food, good wine, laughter, romance, and the elusive new experiences. But I’m trying to settle the part of me that feels I’m missing something. The part telling me if I don’t do more, go more, be more that I won’t have enough stories to tell my grand kids. Live in the here and now. Be present – wherever you are. This is what I’m trying to remind myself of these days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here were the rules (since we’re lawyers and all).  There is a very long list of three.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(1) &lt;strong>Item SHALL have Boolean Attributes.&lt;/strong> This means that at 2359 on 31 December 2011, the item in question must be able to be given a True/False declaration.  This requires the item to be crafted such that it is definable, measurable, and specific.  Items such as “improve the quality of the services we deliver” are definitely out as they cannot be defined.  Items such as “give are clients great services” are definitely out as they cannot be measured.  You get the picture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(2) &lt;strong>Achievement of the item SHALL remain within the reasonable control of the declarant at all times.&lt;/strong> This means that items which are wholly out of control are not allowed.  Items such as “get invited to Davos, TED, and Clinton Global Initiative” are not within the control of the declarant at all and may not be on the list.   There is a qualifier on reasonable control wholly within the control of the declarant may require complete isolation – something us social beings can rarely achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(3) &lt;strong>Item SHALL not be overly materialistic&lt;/strong>. We wanted to track things that were fun and simple rather than list out how I want a new iPad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can follow the progress of the list over &lt;a href="http://elevens.caseykuhlman.com">here&lt;/a>!  I’ll be making small visual storytelling pages for each of the events which lend themselves to such an endeavor.  So, without further adieu: Our 11 for ’11:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Buy Tickets for London Olympics&lt;/li>
&lt;li>One Night of Nothing but Music&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create Tasting Menu w/ Seasonal &amp;amp; Local Products&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ice Skate on a Frozen Pond&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Establish a Home Base&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eat @ a Restaurant Owned by a Top Chef Winner&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attend or Host a Wine Tasting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attend at least one Outdoor Concert&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prepare an alfresco picnic by a stream&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spend our anniversary together&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spend an afternoon mushrooming&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>And to top it off, some legal analysis: &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/opiniojurisfeed/~3/GGwM2RM8dN8/">Steve Vladeck on WikiLeaks&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As to the more journalistic, rather than pundit coverage of the story, the first article I read in that sector is still my favorite.  I was struck by this quote in the second paragraph of &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29cables.html?_r=2?_r=1&amp;amp;pagewanted=all">this NYT article&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The material was originally obtained by &lt;a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/wikileaks/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about WikiLeaks.">WikiLeaks&lt;/a>, an organization devoted to revealing secret documents. WikiLeaks posted 220 cables, some redacted to protect diplomatic sources, in the first installment of the archive on its Web site on Sunday.”  It seems quite arrogant to me that WikiLeaks would redact the documents (if, indeed, they were the ones redacting), surely this must be an all-or-nothing organization.  It is not capable nor positioned to make the determination about sourcing which redacting would require.  I hope that the redactions were done within the cables themselves rather than by WikiLeaks.  The redactions were done by the NYTimes, which seems to me to be quite responsible journalism.  ”The Times, after consultations with the State Department, has withheld from articles and removed from documents it is posting online the names of some people who spoke privately to diplomats and might be at risk if they were publicly identified. The Times is also withholding some passages or entire cables whose disclosure could compromise American intelligence efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The main thing I was struck upon reading the entirety of this article is that this entire deal is quite anticlimatic.  Most everything I’ve seen so far in the entirety of the coverage we knew more or less was happening.  Sure it lends some authority that official diplomatic cables contained the information and the clarity and precision of some of the information is quite striking, but all in all it seems quite benign for the most part.  Which leads me to question the utility of the leak.  I completely understand the vehemence of the Obama administration’s response, but I don’t really understand what all the hullabaloo is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most interesting thing about all this is that everyone from the USG to the lowest individual here with me in Somaliland, we are learning together how to communicate in a web dominated world.  The technology keeps moving the ball before the norms and legalities of a situation have caught up with it and then technology moves the ball again, and again, and again.  Most people still fail to understand that their companies are likely archiving the emails from their work computers, and sometimes even their personal email when it is accessed from a work computer because the company is forced to under watch for due diligence reasons.  Much less to many people understand the privacy implications of their Facebook account.  I don’t even need to bring up the rest of the methods and tools for modern communication.  While the private / public barriers are still relatively strong, the grey area is widening and classifying itself.  In other words much of where we currently are is in a grey area but where exactly we are in that middle part of the spectrum and what the rules and norms are within that are difficult to decipher.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shared a few days ago the following comment on Buzz, and my brother, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/kuhlman">@kuhlman&lt;/a>, had a nice response to which I cannot add much.  I don’t agree entirely with his comment, but I’d like to give him the last word.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>While I appreciate the suggestion that “compartmentalization will be back in vogue real soon”, this and Robert Gate’s comments (also excerpted by Drezner in a later post) which suggest the inevitable indispensability of America bespeak a posture of American arrogance. Drezner asks rhetorically if he’s missing something, but doesn’t really believe that there is anything more (the so-called Big Lie). Why is it that shallowness must be the accompaniment to transparency? I agree that there is a great difference between the things we say in public and the things we say in private, but if we are to substantively engage our fellow global cohabitants in a meaningful discourse we must accept a conversation which allows for both deep, nuanced exchanges and the possibility that America is not indispensable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[![Dangling Professional via kenyee @ flickr][3]][3]&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="relationalists-v-substantialists">Relationalists v. Substantialists&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I’ve written before, I tend to think with a different lens than many of my peers from America who live here in Africa.  I’m a relationalist caught in a substantialist world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems indicative that those who are arguing that there is a space for both seem to be approaching their argument from a relationalist point of view.  My favorite post so far in this vein is [Penelope’s][3].  Another crew seem to be saying that there is little room for “amateurs” whatsoever, and they structure their argument from a substantialist point of view.  My favorite post so far in this vein is [J from Tales][4] (who wrote a series, but this post is my favorite).  A third crew is somehow in the middle and it essentially argues that it is all about the effects rather than the background.  My favorite post in the “can’t we all get along” vein is [Saundra’s][5].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The skills on J’s list, for instance, are completely substantialist.  They don’t require much in the way of relational capacity.  That may be fine for humanitarian workers who come in an go out rather frequently.  The success of their work, I would argue, depends less on their ability to have successful trust-based relationships than it does on their analytical and problem-solving skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Humanitarian work – by which I’m defining as those lifesaving response mechanisms which are attempting to provide a baseline to human existence – can and should be the type of work that is dominated by scientific, analytical people.  I’m not saying that WFP P-4 disaster response team leaders (I have no idea what they are called, but I bet it isn’t too far from this) can’t, shouldn’t, or won’t get to know people where they are going next, but I would argue that their job description likely doesn’t absolutely require it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thad Allen gave a [nice talk][6] to HBR recently which I heard on their Ideacast podcast.  He spoke about leadership through a major disaster and the measures that he took.  I was struck that there was little to no time spent on relationship building outside his core team, but he spent some significant percentage of his time talking about relationships within the team and PR (which I do not think has anything to do with relationships other then on the extreme definition of that word).  I have no quibble with this, and generally I would agree that disaster relief work does not depend so much on building relationships, other than at a very low baseline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, other types of work require other skill sets, particularly an ability to build trust-based relationships. In my former work with a legal reform NGO to be successful at my job required absolutely none of the skills which Tales points to.  We wrote many successful grants as a team and never once did we do the slightest bit of regression analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I needed to understand who the power-brokers were in Parliament. I needed to understand how to convey the notions of process, political bargaining, policies, and the legal mechanisms which can be used to address imbalances in each of the above.  Being successful at that did not require me to understand statistics in the slightest, it required me to understand humanity and legality.  Now when the time came to discuss specific policy choices which the parliamentarians were considering, at that time, my statistics background (gleaned from engineering undergrad classes and bolstered by self-learning and ensuring that remain current on development economic trends) although marginal, did serve me well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the basic point is that to achieve my ends required understanding the relationships around me, developing trust from a group who is heartily skeptical about outsiders because so many have just come for a temporary time and tried to lecture my old clients on how to run their country.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Another ancillary issue which struck me (and is somewhat related to the above) when I was reading the comments below Saundra’s list is that there really is a lack of a precise definitional consensus as to “development sector.”  For instance, I see little to no correlation between what a legal reform NGO does and what an emergency relief NGO/UNOrgan do.  And yet, somehow they are both in the same sector.  I can see from an ultra-macro perspective how they would somewhat be aligned in the same way that wordpress and intel are both in the computer sector.  But the skill sets, backgrounds, knowledge base, and all the rest which are required to work at wordpress and to work at intel are so incredibly divergent.  This is one of the reasons why the existential question which the meme is struggling with strikes me as odd to begin with – it is hard to define what makes a successful project manager in one instance because of the cultural basis into which they are operating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like the anthropologists who go into villages and then continually navel gaze about observer interaction and whether than changes the situation (there is some term here I’m sure but am too lazy to google it), this conversation – while interesting – does not strike me as especially relevant without first putting some qualifications on what we’re talking about.  Is this about building village wells and schools?  Is this about delivering huge amounts of food to an area of low food security?  Is this about trying to build capacity of an anti-corruption committee?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without first providing some definitional clarity the meat of the argument seems to go past one another as each assumes that everyone else requires the same things that they do in order to succeed.  Just because we all are Westerners working for NGO’s in Africa doesn’t mean that we are necessarily one “profession.”  We are many professions which are loosely grouped together and continuing to compare our relative apples and oranges.&lt;/p>

Indeed, I think that patriotism now that we are moving into the post-states (for all intents and purposes) world has somehow turned into a dirty word. I’m not sure how that happened. Certainly, for us Americans, being the big, dumb, blumbering dude in a room filled with slicker, sleeker, shinier countries hasn’t helped our cause any.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, see, here’s the thing. We Americans ARE awesome. I mean I wouldn’t go so far as to say that we’re the most awesome (&lt;em>see, e.g.&lt;/em> our deeply teetering economy, our inability to solve any of the major global problems that the rest of the world is desperately looking for some leadership from us, and oh yeah Big Macs).  But we shouldn’t be afraid to say that even given all that, we’re still pretty awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this is where the Norah Jones comes into the equation.  I don’t know if it isn’t cool that I like her music.  *Yeah, all right you think, Come Away With Me as an alright song.  but she’s a bit too “pop-py” for my tastes *(and you would likely draw out the “oooooo” in that word).  But she has really incredible range.  She had great songs from a huge variety of genres.  And even when you try to take away the lens that your inner hipster hatred for the “pop” makes you don and you try to listen to each of her different songs as if they were from an artist who you normally associated with that genre.  In other words when she sings a country song, it is a really good song even if I thought of her whole persona as a country singer.  She’s digging up old slave / civil rights songs.  She’s licking on classic bluegrass and still classic but a bit more mainstream country and jazz songs.  And they all sound really good.  She’s working with tons of different types of people, likely trying finding some of the greatest musicians rolling around New York City right now to dig up exciting new combinations that really work.  And there, in that city, she has elite artists of possibly every single major and most minor musical cultures in the entire world.  It is cliche, but true, only in America.  Nobody else’s got that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, sure, we got our panties in a wad over a freaking mosque being placed two blocks from ground zero, when daily I can’t walk two blocks without hitting at least three mosques wherever I go.  So we got that stuff, but we got cool stuff too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is a huge part of me which appreciates this from a consumer point of view.  It makes it easier to do your task management when you “feel” as if you “like” the program you are using and even better when you feel as if you “know” something about those who made it, where they are trying to go with it, etc.  It enables a feeling of community and communal interest even though I’m here in Somaliland and they may be thousands of miles away.  This interactivity is powerful when applied to corporate behavior as it allows companies to leverage the increased loyalty and interactivity found in small community-based businesses with the scales of economy found in large MNC’s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many times being open is more efficient than being closed.  It is also quite efficient to tag and publish your links in a way that allows your team and your community to see them.  I mean everyone will keep current with news, analysis, etc. within their sector.  Pushing those links into the semi-public team spaces and public community spaces with the click of one button.  Why not?  At the end of the day it saves you more time than having to break these tasks of media consumption, team discussion, and marketing into individual blocks.  Crowdsourcing is another great example of openness’s links to efficiency.  See &lt;a href="http://weijiblog.com/2010/10/62-diaspora-and-kickstarter/">this&lt;/a> great entry from the &lt;a href="http://weijiblog.com/">weijiblog&lt;/a> as an example of what I’m talking about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this is well and good.  But there are a few tensions which any organization must be aware of.  These areas should pull you back from a 100% open business if they apply to your situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="confidentiality--duh">Confidentiality – Duh&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The most obvious tension with openness that we, and other professional services companies, face is that of client confidentiality.  As lawyers we have to put in an extremely rigid firewall between the reception area and the back area of our online presence.  Discussing what we are working on today is a no-go if it is anything whatsoever to do with client activity.  Sure I use &lt;a href="http://foursquare.com/compleatang">foursquare&lt;/a> and many times it check-in when I’m making sales calls.  But I never do it when I’m having a client meeting.  Sure I blog, tweet, etc.  But never about client matters.  Ancillary to client matters is even a personal no-go area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each individual professional organization and each professional within that organization will be subjected to their own specific confidentiality requirements.  Many lawyers get around these by blogging anonymously but still revealing many confidential facts of a case simply by hiding in plain sight and not mentioning names.  While this may work for them, I have personally chosen a different path.  I prefer to blog publicly using my real given name and simply not put into the public space those things which I’m required (and would anyway even if I wasn’t required) to maintain as confidential.  I see the value in the humor of some blogs I read by public defenders or other practitioners.  But I would never write one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="areas-of-strategic-advantage">Areas of Strategic Advantage&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The less obvious tension with openness is that of commodification of those areas where your organization has a distinct strategic advantage.  This is something which I struggle with more.  Operating where we operate and having the research base which we have built and having the connections which we have has taken a lot of time and a lot of work.  It isn’t the easiest place to live and it certainly isn’t the easiest place to operate.  But nevertheless, we are making it work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a strategic advantage for our firm.  We are well connected abroad and locally.  We have a deeper understanding that probably any organization in the world as to the current state of the Somaliland legal system.  So there is a huge tension for me when it comes to this area.  On the one hand, I truly believe that laws should be published by the governments which pass them.  This information needs to be public and freely available to all those who may be subjected to its provisions.  But the reality is that the Somaliland government has not done this.  We do have all of the applicable laws, but we have had to find many of them.  Some we even had to pay some money to acquire.  So when a lawyer from abroad emails to ask about this law or that law and if we can send it to them I struggle to find the proper answer.  While we are building our firm we need to leverage each of the strategic advantages which we have   Maybe later, when we’re more established and our cash flow is more stable then we can relax and open up a few of the strategic advantages – especially in the area of information vis a vis analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a danger here also which is that if you begin with the habits of holding your cards closer than you optimally may that that habit will become a policy rather than the habit of the beginning organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But for now, and for us, it is unlikely that I’m going to give you those things which I have worked very hard to achieve.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But the Hargeisa Trade Fair was a bit different.  First off, they didn’t have that many booths.  Granted we were a bit late to the game, but it was still fairly annoying that we were unable to secure a booth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chalked it up, before going, to a good development.  If the trade fair had sold out its booths as they were telling us then that must mean that there would be a lot of local business there, so no matter if we had a booth it would be beneficial to just go and network from the other side of the booth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we went.  To the Hargeisa NGO Fair.  Save the Children had maybe a quarter of the booths.  Different UN agencies were there.  The Somaliland Ministry of Planning was there.  Tons of other NGOs had booths.  What was there, but only on the margins, were businesses.  This is how the game goes in a screwed up economy.  The businesses get pushed to the margins to make way for individuals empowered by my tax dollars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t have any problems per se with STC buying a quarter of the booths at the trade fair to show off what they are doing.  My free market proclivities are, at times, binding.  That said, it is super annoying.  Mainly because it does not make much sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me begin here.  I have deep philosophical problems with the notion that development has turned into an industry, complete with &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=mpaid">dedicated degrees&lt;/a>, [think tanks][3], and navel gazing [memes][4] about professionals v. amateurs.   While I can agree with the notion that professionalism and progress within the development sector is an overall benefit which helped lead us to [this point][5], the core of the development story is often lost.  This is an industry which is deeply entrenched on the Hill, with Number 10, and in Brussels.  But it is an industry which should, at least according to its own rhetoric, be working itself out of existence.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Instead, we have a very different current situation.  One of deepening entrenchment rather than working for your own demise.  Here in Hargeisa at least NGO’s are the craved jobs.  They suck up the brains of the country with their steady jobs, their culturally relevant salaries, and their extremely limited advancement opportunities.  And then the NGOs talk about brain drain.  How awful that smart people want to leave their country because they have reduced opportunities to pursue their dreams.  Isn’t a bit hypocritical to moan and complain about meta-brain-drain when micro-brain-drain is happening by the people doing the complaining?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then there are the brochures, the brilliant web sites, the signs on the land cruisers, etc.  I have nothing against charity:water producing a fantastic site.  I have nothing against glossy brochures showing pictures of people in trouble.  I have nothing against the UN putting “Donated by:” on every single vehicle they buy for governments.  What I have a problem with is why in the world this is happening at all in Hargeisa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Marketing needs to have a purpose and an audience.  So what is the purpose and intended audience of the above cited things?  If the intended audience is donors who are the ones making the decisions whether to extend funding, start a new program with a given organization, restrict funding, etc. then I have no problem.  In that case you have a situation where marketing makes sense as the cost of doing business.  I may continue to have philosophical problems with the “industrialization” of the sector, but at least I can see a purpose to glossy brochures in fancy DC offices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But here in Hargeisa?  I mean donors come here like twice a year.  What is the point the rest of the time?  Is this marketing aimed at the beneficiaries?  If so, then wouldn’t the money be more efficiently used to buying one more X (insert your pet project’s purpose here)?  This is the crux of what was annoying me last week about the NGO fun fair.  Why was the money being spent at all?  Fine if it was marketing on behalf of the beneficiaries of livelihood training projects that is one thing.  And I grant that *some *of the NGO fun fair booths &lt;em>were&lt;/em> doing that exact thing.  But the rest of it, I have no idea.  Do you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some pictures we took from the fun fair are below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When you look at this picture what do you see?  I see a man who is satisfied with his situation.  Sure there are the tribal markings, the blanket over the shoulder, the bleakness of the background and the stuff on the back of the man’s neck.  But what really jumps out, to me at least, is the satisfied look that his eyes and his mouth convey.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two development pundit bloggers have discussed recently the cultural meme which the photos that are chosen to accompany NGO marketing campaigns, news articles on Africa, etc. convey. &lt;a href="http://www.how-matters.org/about/"> Jennifer Lentfer&lt;/a> who runs &lt;a href="http://www.how-matters.org/">how-matters.org&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://glennagordon.com/">Glenna Gordon&lt;/a> who runs &lt;a href="http://www.scarlettlion.com/">ScarlettLion.com&lt;/a>, among other sites, &lt;a href="http://www.how-matters.org/2010/10/24/pity-pictures-and-poverty/">both&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.scarlettlion.com/2010/10/just-how-stereotypical-are-images-of-africa.html">posted&lt;/a> on this issue yesterday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Am not sure exactly, but seems that the beginning of the conversation was Jennifer finding &lt;a href="http://waterwellness.ca/2010/04/28/perspectives-of-poverty/">this&lt;/a> posting from &lt;a href="http://waterwellness.ca/about/">Duncan McNicholl&lt;/a>.  The premise of Duncan’s posting is that the same subject arranged in two different modes conveys two very different emotional responses.  To take it a step further, the argument goes that the types of images which are chosen to be displayed in NGO marketing items, donor reports, media reports, etc. reflect both the world’s pre-conceived image of Africa &lt;em>as well as&lt;/em> furthering the intention of the person or organization which is using the image.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, this makes sense.  Generally most people would prefer to vindicate held opinions rather than challenge them.  But challenging opinions is the only way to change the cultural lens and changing the cultural lens is one of the post powerful enabling mechanisms for solidifying deep changes within societies.  Indeed, the NY Times ran a great &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24FOB-Footbinding-t.html?_r=2&amp;amp;partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;pagewanted=all">article&lt;/a> in their weekend magazine about this topic yesterday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The thing is this (he says as he puts on his lawyer hat) it takes a long time to change the perspectives of people.  It takes words, images, experience, and most of all repetition.  It takes emotional arguments, data-based arguments, and logical arguments.   And it is slow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Civil rights, suffrage, abolition, etc. did not come about just because someone in a position of authority said, “yeah this is how it is going to happen.”  They happened because first people worked hard to show the problems with the current cultural lens.  This happened through broad-based approaches (which obviously varied considering the different times and persons involved).  After the cultural lens was changed sufficiently, then legal and political mechanisms were triggered which could provide some accountability around the new cultural norm which was developing.  Those legal and political mechanisms have to be triggered *after *there is sufficiency in the base of people who will believe that what you are arguing for makes sense despite the history and the cultural norms of the moment.  Those legal and political mechanisms &lt;em>have&lt;/em> to be triggered (usually) in order to bring the “rest” into compliance with the cultural norm; in other words, to provide accountability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what in the world does that have to do with pictures in shiny brochures?  First, the analogy very much falls apart when probed in depth, so don’t do that.   I bring it up mainly to show that cultural change takes time and effort along many different tracks.  It seems to me that we’re at the beginning of this process with respect to the “world’s” opinion of “Africa.”  Even for development workers and bloggers I still see all too frequently a headline which says, essentially, “wow there’s some good news from Africa and here is what it is.”  It is of lesser import to me the surprise which is consonant in the headlines.  What is of greater import is that the headlines are running.  They are running more and more, at least across my twitter and rss feeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This base hopefully will in due course enable the triggering of some powerful accountability mechanisms.  Although the accountability mechanisms which can solidify the march towards progress which so many in the cheetah generation deserve and crave will not be as strong as a declaration as (say) an amendment to the US Constitution would be, they will be there.  And their presence will help to change the assumptions of the cultural laggards.  Perhaps more importantly, they will allow the next generation of elites within many countries of Africa to make the difficult decisions and to take the difficult steps which will reduce the income gaps and bring the middle class further along.  And after that, things will take care of themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is great stuff happening throughout Africa all the time.  People are creating beautiful images, beautiful paintings, and beautiful narratives.  It is fantastic to see, and I appreciate that people are pointing these out.  As more and more people hop onto the train the momentum will grow, not slow.  Some recent examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>African Digital Art’s Weekly Inspiration Postings: &lt;a href="http://www.africandigitalart.com/category/african-weekly-inspiration/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>NYTimes Lens Blog on Dakar: &lt;a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/senegals-changing-urban-landscape/">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Peter DiCampo’s Life without Lights series: &lt;a href="http://www.peterdicampo.com/#/life-without-lights/nightly-life/NIGHTLY_LIFE-1">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Sure things are still screwed up in many many ways.  But what is important to me about the meme which is developing is that the baseline assumptions about what the “current state of Africa” is moving.  This will create/has created a base of support among many.  At this point it seems to be coming mainly from development people and Africans themselves who are increasingly using the megaphone of the internet to get their message across.  But it has to begin somewhere.  From this base, a larger base will grow and the meme will extend to laggards within organizations and to laggard organizations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course it will be a long time before the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/magazine/24sirleaf-t.html?ref=ellen_johnson_sirleaf">profile&lt;/a> of a ground-breaking woman will not begin with the backdrop of devastation, conflict, and decay.  It will be a long time until even those of us that live here in Africa change our assumptions to reflect the progress which is all around us.  And yet, it is happening.  Slowly but surely, like a nomad moving to a new grazing area, the collective cultural lens is shifting.  For me, for now, that is enough.&lt;/p>

This series explores those differences.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I generally prefer to point out the similarities between disparate people.  I enjoy very much the common humanity aspects about my life.  But I equally enjoy learning about the differences.  This post contains more of the latter than the former.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m American and we are taught from a young age that a major part of being an American means that you are individualistic.  Our pop culture and education system celebrate individuality and the human against the odds above many other cultural memes.  Most of the people that have immigrated to America over the years have come to chase something that was related to individual efforts.  Those of us who descend from those who immigrated we have it both from nature and from nurture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somalilanders are taught precisely the opposite.   They celebrate communal victories above individual victories in their poetry and dramas and songs.  They rely on communal networks for insurance when things get tough.  Collective responsibility is bred into them as deeply as individual responsibility has been bred into me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two months ago my Ethiopian watchman stole an SUV that I was borrowing from a friend and he drove it so fast (likely enjoying his own sense of individuality and freedom of the road – something that isn’t a big leap for me to empathize with) that when he had to swerve to hit someone he hit a bump and jumped the SUV, and I mean jumped it, on top of other cars.  Two other cars that were sitting in a used car dealership beside the road.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was told about it I was pretty crushed because I knew instantly that I would have to pay for the damage.  Even though he had stolen from me.  Even though his job description involved neither driving nor speeding.  Even though I had not the slightest to do with the situation.  Because that is the way that things work.  Everyone is responsible for everyone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the Ethiopian kid had been Somali and the employer was not responsible then the clan would provide the necessary insurance.  If I as the employer had been Somali and I was unable to cover the costs then my clan would have been called upon to provide the insurance.   But neither of us fit into that system.  I paid.  I had no other choice.  I could reason through very easily that in my system I wasn’t liable.  But I wasn’t living in my system.  I gain the consequences of the system but not the benefits.  I guess that is life though and how many minorities throughout history have had that exact thought?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing that is fairly prevalent is that senior Somalis working for organizations get held personally liable for all of the actions or non-actions of the organization.  My number two with my old NGO recently had his power shut off because of a dispute between the power company the organization signed a services contract with and the party responsible for paying the final two months electricity bill.  Sure his name isn’t on the invoices, but his name is there in the computer as the responsible party.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can be very annoying when you are held responsible for the actions of another that you “normally” would not have to be responsible for.  But when you understand the system and you understand that there &lt;em>is&lt;/em> a system, although maybe facially foreign.  Then you can at least navigate it.  But if you’re new to Somalis these are key because how you treat your staff and the pressures that especially your senior staff will face need to be understood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Relationships here in Somaliland are odd, to say the least.  There are two main identifiable cultural divergences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first is that many relationships are deeper here in Somaliland than similar relationships would be back home.  Deeper in the sense that they are more utilized, more cherished, and more complicated than a similar set of relationships would be in America.  (I will return to these themes, but let me finish my introduction first.  Don’t be in such a hurry!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second is that many (other) relationships are shallower that similar relationships would be back home.  They are more shallow in the sense that they are less utilized, less cherished, and less complicated than a similar set of relationships would be in America.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time this was opaque to me.  And then the scenery started to open up, but like with the two stories from an earlier &lt;a href="http://www.caseykuhlman.com/?p=421">post&lt;/a> on decoding the somali mind there was little cultural alignment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what I was seeing after I had been here long enough to scratch the surface coating off of the Somalilanders.  On the one hand, I was seeing friends who would actually talk to one another about many different issues.  Friends who would gather and sit and discuss, day after day.  But on the other hand I was seeing romantic relationships that were either business relationships or almost elementary.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="romantic-relationships">Romantic Relationships&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last week, a woman dumped a jug full of kerosene all over her body and lit herself on fire.  Just 30 meters from the gate of our compound.  Apparently it was because her boyfriend broke up with her. It was in the early evening and there were many people around.  They forced the woman to stop-drop-and-roll.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently she survived the initial situation and was taken to the hospital.  Considering the healthcare in this country and her likely third-degree burns I’m unsure whether she survived for very long thereafter. Although my initial reaction was that this was about a passionate, tragic love affair gone wrong – a story which likely any culture can relate to – it was more likely about the stigma which would follow the poor woman after the man refused to marry her after their affair had gone public.  I do not know that for certain, but it is my educated guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Relationships between the sexes are tremendously strained here in Somaliland.  While that comes with the territory in many ways, what I’ve noticed is that in many ways relationships, especially romantic relationships, between the sexes are riven with what I would consider immaturities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Twenty-somethings and thirty-somethings that are involved in romantic relationships rarely discuss their relationships, creating a situation of insularity stifling development and deepening of many of the relationships. Of course, arranged marriages are still very customary and prevalent.  In these cases the romance and the business-politics of clan and diyah-paying groups are conflated forcing individuals into catch-22 situations where they are forced to subordinate their own desires for the benefit of their clan or family.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me personally, it is fascinating to learn about this situation because it seems such a throw-back.  I suspect for much of human history marrying someone for business-political reasons has been more important than many current historians / anthropologists would give credit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of months ago I was chewing with some people including some American-Somalilander diaspora and they were asking me one of the biggest questions I always get: “how do you find Somaliland”?  I like it when diaspora ask me this question because they find themselves in a situation similar to me – somewhere in between the two cultures. Usually when non-diaspora ask me this question I give an white-washed answer.  This time, for whatever reason, I was feeling especially honest.  I replied that for the most part I have not experienced much culture shock as I read and studied a lot before I even arrived.  The thing which has been the biggest cultural shock to me, I told them, has been the cultural response to a widowing. In Somali culture (and I am told but cannot confirm – many Arab cultures) if a husband passes away his brother will be forced to marry the sister-in-law. When I first heard this, I remember shaking my head and furrowing my brow deeply.  But I asked why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer, actually, makes semi-sense.  It is because if the wife remarries someone outside of the family than the children that she had with her deceased husband will be considered outsiders by the new husband and he will abandon them.  So it is a cultural mechanism to ensure that the children were taken care of.  That I can see and understand – to the extent that it is simply a support mechanism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later, when I became closer to more Somalis, I asked about the reality and the thing that was really creeping me out – does the brother have to have sex with the former sister-in-law or can it be a show marriage. Their answer was that if the brother doesn’t have sex with the sister-in-law then it isn’t a marriage after all.  Fair enough, but I must say that I’m pleased my own culture has never adopted this situation as it feels too much like incest based upon my own cultural upbringing and proclivities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These anecdotes are a simple reflection of why I say that romantic relationships here in Somaliland are very different than the romantic relationships that I’m accustomed to – tending towards much more shallow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="friendly-relationships">Friendly Relationships&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the other hand, friendly relationships are much deeper than anything that I’m accustomed to.  And here is where I get to the reason for why I chose the picture at the top (aside from his magnificent beauty in austerity).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somalilanders value their friendships so much.  It is one of the things that I appreciate most about being here.  When you meet someone that you haven’t seen in a while you are guaranteed a big hug, a big smile, a ten minutes of your life you’ll never get back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other thing that surprises me is how quickly two people will become friends.  In a short time you go from Mister to Friend to Brother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For men, especially, there is an avenue by which one can almost fully guarantee they will have a friend for life.  It is what is called fadhigaa or qayilayaa or cunayaa or chewing or sitting together.  Chewing sessions are a great avenue for discussion.  They have a major downside which is that it’s a men’s only club, but that is a deeper issue which I will leave for another time.  Chewing sessions usually last about six hours – although sometimes more, sometimes less depending on the circumstances.  From about 3 pm to 9 pm men will gather in their normal meeting spot.  When you arrive in a majlis (the place for sitting) you get yourself all arranged with your cigarettes in one place, your drinks in another place, your qat over here, your laptop and phone over there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then you sit back take a few deep breathes, and just sit and talk for the next hours.  Like with alcohol or marijuana, qat affects different people differently.  It varies with your state of mind when you begin, with the distinct strain that you always buy, and with your own personal reaction to the qat.  It makes some people retreat into themselves.  You won’t hear from them for hours.  I am not among those.  The other general trend is that it opens people up and is a decent social lubricator.  These people will end up talking and talking and talking much more than when they are sober.  I am among those.  Men come together and listen to the radio, watch BBC or Al Jazeera or the National TV, read the Somali sites, and talk.  This time together in a relaxed environment cements friendships deeply.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The water system in Hargeisa is over stretched, under maintained, now badly managed network, under funded cluster of an organization.  It makes money so the government doesn’t want to privatize it.  And that is likely the right move considering the power system is privatized and is a mess.  It is all the rage to claim that the private sector is going to save Africa, and I while I believe that I’m not a complete free marketer.  The private sector can be just as lazy and dumb as a public sector can be.  The presence of competition does not necessitate innovation and good economic behavior in and of itself.  But that is a different story and before I go down that road, let me tell you about my pipe problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pipes that supply Hargeisa were buried about an 1 deep all willy nilly throughout the place.  Whenever you go off of the main roads it is inevitable that you’ll have to drive over one.  That isn’t a structural economic problem.  That has little to do with Ministerial efficiency or World Bank proclamations.  It is just stupid and lazy workmanship.  It doesn’t have anything to do with a depressed education system or beleaguered healthcare system.  it is just stupid and lazy workmanship.  Nothing more, nothing less.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And because these pipes were not buried deep enough, and because I live near a bus station, the pipes that come to my house often are broken by buses running over them.  And then we have to pay for a plumber to come fix them.  The Water Agency this time even refused to drive a plumber up here even after we agreed to pay for the plumber.  And then after we brought the plumber up here to our sector of Hargeisa, the guy wanted $20, TWENTY DOLLARS, to do the fifteen minutes of work it would require to cut a new pipe, tap it, and tighten it onto the new pipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I told the guy to f-off.  He laughed, I rolled my eyes, he said ten, I agreed.  And then he fixed the pipe.  But since that time no water has come through the pipes.  I don’t think they’re broken as we can usually tell.  In the morning when we drive to work if the water has come and the pipe is broken it just pools uselessly in the muck at the main intersection of the bus station.  In a desert country with small water resources no one seems to give an F about this water just sitting there.  But that hasn’t happened in the past week or ten days since we paid the plumber to fix the water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is that the case?  Because I live near a hotel.  You know the kind, one of the few places in town known to cater to expats.  They are all in one shape or form the same.  But the guy who owns the hotel pays the guy who controls the water in our sector a little bit more each month and so the water guy reroutes almost all of the water to the hotel.  The old Hargeisa water manager was a friend of ours and when we told him our hypothesis in this regard he investigated, found it to be true, fought tooth and nail (I heard directly many of the conversations between him and the sector manager who is below him) for us, and still was only moderately successful in getting us water.  Since he was sacked for unknown reasons which had nothing to do with his competence but basically boiled down to the other dude supported the government than won the recent election and had to be rewarded somehow, since that time we have gotten water through the pipes on only a couple of occasions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So water and I have seemingly broken up.  And that is not cool with me.  It isn’t cool in a way that  has nothing to do with what any policymaker or bureaucrat or large NGO marketing department wants me to think.  It isn’t cool and it has nothing to do with funding levels (throwing more money at the sector isn’t going to get the pipes buried deeper, repaired faster, or micro-managed more equitably), bold statements, or glossy web sites.  It isn’t cool and much of it comes down to stupidity and laziness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Excuse me, I gotta run, the dude that drives the donkey cart with the ex-oil drum on the back is here to deliver my water.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the longest while, I’ve been obsessed with time management &amp;amp; efficiency.   In college my good friend &lt;a href="http://millensonthemove.blogspot.com/">Dave&lt;/a>, who was running the orientation program for our ROTC that year, asked me to give a class on time management.  It was one of the most enjoyable topics I’ve ever lectured on.   We were incoming seniors and we were talking to incoming freshmen.  At the time I was listening to lots of Zig Zigler.  I remember my tips included always carrying around a small notebook with you and writing down to dos, things you liked in the day, etc.  I don’t remember the rest of my sage-like wisdom.  That would have been the summer of 1998.  Now I just use my mobile to take notes rather than the pen and paper method.  The rest is below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always have idealized those people who would rise early and have five or six newspapers read before they went to work.  Yet, everyone knows I am far from a morning person.  But, still, I try to emulate those people in my own way.  I’ve used RSS readers in one form or another for probably six or seven years.  It is a fantastic technology which allows me to get tabs on the content from numerous sites without having to wait for those sites to load, scan the pages, figure out what I have and have not read, read the content I’m interested in, and then do something with that information.   For a long time I used FeedDemon.  Eventually he integrated Google Reader sync into FeedDemon and I switched all my subscriptions over to Reader.  After that it was a short leep to &lt;a href="http://feedly.com">feedly&lt;/a>, which I currently use exclusively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how RSS works.  When a site publishes content (new articles, etc.) it pushes that content out to the RSS feed.  The feed reader then pulls in that content and only that content.  Google Reader acts as the feed reader, and pulls in all of the content.  Feedly, on the other hand is simply and overlay for the Reader interface.  All of this allows me to keep tabs on tons of sites while only having to visit one site.  Living in a country with low bandwidth this is a lifesaver.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reading-content">Reading Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Generally I begin by scanning all of the headlines and excerpts on each of the category pages that I have built into feedly/reader.  These are like the sections of the newspaper – more or less.  Either I read the content directly as I’m working through the content and pages, or if I’ve slept late I save the articles for later.  When I’ve finished the category, I mark it as read and move on to the next one.  It usually takes about 15 minutes to scan everything, a bit more time if I read some of the content on the initial sweep.  Feedly has a great interface for reading content.  I have begun hating all of the extraneous stuff that people put on sites (thus the subtle redesign my site and my company’s &lt;a href="http://watershedlegal.com">site&lt;/a> – which is ongoing).  I find the latest tweets of the site, all of the follow options, all of the related content, etc. to be annoying.  First it distracts from the content – which is the reason I’m on the site to begin with.  Second it takes bandwidth – usually lots of bandwidth and java crunching – to load all of that stuff.  Feedly is ultra-fast on my slow machine when I use my Chrome, so it is great for reading content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saving articles for later is fantastic with &lt;a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper&lt;/a>.  It is a very light-weight site which is really open and integrates well with both my phone and my laptop.  While I’m working through my feedly if I am late or not interested in the time with the article but know I will be later, I simply push the Instapaper icon in feedly and it is saved.  During the day if I’m waiting on something generally I will use my phone to scan my twitter feeds and my reader articles that have come in, when I find something interesting it takes three button pushes to save the article onto Instapaper (I use &lt;a href="http://mobileways.de/gravity">Gravity&lt;/a> on my Nokia E72, and is integrated with my facebook, twitter, reader, and foursquare accounts).  During the day if I see something good either on twitter or just while generally being around it takes one click to save on Instapaper (I used &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/kbmipnjdeifmobkhgogdnomkihhgojep">Shareaholic&lt;/a> extension for &lt;a href="http://chrome.google.com">Chrome&lt;/a>).  There are tons of ways to “save for later” and I have tried many of them, but I generally try to keep one basket for everything.  Instapaper shines with long form articles as it will clip the text only – another lifesaver for my low-bandwidth constraints.  I especially like the using the &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/ppelffpjgkifjfgnbaaldcehkpajlmbc">iReader&lt;/a> extension for Chrome which blows everything up and is perfect when you want to sit back on focus on the text of an article without all of the clutter that is on most sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="after-reading-content">After Reading Content&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the first things I think about after reading a good piece of content is I want to share it.  As I’m working my way through my feedly generally I use the save for later feature that feedly has (which is integrated with your reader save for later) as my saving queue.  I find it more efficient to just push one button and move along keeping my focus on the next piece of content, rather than getting distracted by figuring out the intended share audience for the content.  Sometimes, it is clear to me that what I want to do with the article and feedly is great for that as it has most of the integrations for sharing that I need.  Also if I want to save the article in (see below) I can just push the Evernote button and voila.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After I have read the content usually I want to do something with that content – either save it as a reference for later or share it.  As my reference basket I have tried different options also, but at this point I use only &lt;a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote&lt;/a>.  It has nice integration, although it is not as widely integrated as Instapaper is.  It has its own extension for Chrome, but I find that it was superfluous when I was already using the Shareaholic extension.  Both the Evernote extension and Shareaholic were pulling up the same interface, so there was no point in using them both.  Evernote has a desktop app, but my laptop is old and doesn’t have much RAM so mainly I use the web app in Chrome as it is lighter.  Evernote allows you to organize articles using the best scenario (for me): both categories and tagging.  Some others delicious, digg, instapaper, use only one of the two organizing methods, but I prefer Evernote’s dual-nature for referencing articles.  I also use Evernote as my current notepad to remember random crap – although it doesn’t have a Symbian app that will be cured when I am able to grab an Android phone.  The last thing I like about Evernote is that it allows you to share your notebooks, which we use for our company.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sharing, sharing, sharing.  Blah, blah, blah.  Here’s how I do it, at any rate.  I mainly use &lt;a href="http://hootsuite.com">Hootsuite&lt;/a> to monitor all of my networks.  My only current gripe about Hootsuite is that they have not yet integrated with Buzz.  Hootsuite generally does everything well.  What I tend to do after I’ve read everything in my feedly that I want to read, is I go to my saved items in feedly and then work through them.  Generally I will press the tweet button in feedly and that will shorten the URL (using bit.ly not Hootsuite’s proprietary shortener, ow.ly) and grab the title of the article.  Then I’ll copy that over to my Hootsuite, where I can share the article with different networks by simply selecting the ones that I want.  Different networks have different social mores for sharing content, so I generally have a small think about what the intended audience for the sharing is.  I monitor three twitter accounts, my facebook, two facebook pages, and my linked in on Hootsuite.  Each of those have different profiles so I try to figure out who I want the content to go to.  If it is only one of the audiences that rather than using Hootsuite I will just share the article directly from feedly.  The other feature I use a lot on Hootsuite is the scheduling feature.  Since I’m seven hours ahead of East Coast time in the US, and many of my friends are there, I generally delay some of my sharing to the afternoon my time, which is the morning their time.  Also because I do my news sweep mostly in the morning, I want to space that content sharing out over the day rather than flooding my feeds only in the morning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Going Local: Finding Your Happy Place</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-10-12-local-finding-happy-place/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2010/2010-10-12-local-finding-happy-place/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>On Going Local is a new (short) series that I’ll be running which will attempt to look at my life from an objective perspective as I transition from and NGO worker into an entrepreneur here in the developing world.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been here in Somaliland now for around two and a half years now.  It has been a wonderful time, and I’ve enjoyed every minute of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many aspects of Somali / Somaliland society &amp;amp; culture that I have found it easy to adjust too.  But there are a few things which have been difficult.  Not the least of which is the six day work week.  Being an Islamic country, we take Friday off.  But that most people take off.  Going from a two day weekend to a one day weekend with shorter days throughout the six was a big adjustment and I’m not sure that I will ever fully adjust to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this is about space.  Physical space.  Like most development workers I lived for a long time in a &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/caseykuhlman/SomalilandCompound02" title="Gorgorka Luxury Estates">gigantic house&lt;/a> shared among an assortment of other expatriates, cleaners, cooks, guards, and staff.  It can be a fantastically good time having all the excitement of different activities, smells, and languages around you.  For a little while…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a time, though, it becomes stifling.  For one thing, you are never “off duty.”  At any time of the day or night someone may come and knock on your door.  Someone’s family member is sick and they need money; someone’s mobile phone was stolen and they need money; the guards caught two people making out in a dark corner behind the house; all sound tracked to random gunshots due to land disputes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most development or aid workers I know always like to say it’s not a job, it’s a lifestyle.  And that is all well and good, but it isn’t a lifestyle I was very interested in.  Sure you can try to set boundaries, but you don’t want to incentivize the people working with you to not tell you what is happening.   That can lead to all kinds of problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This balance is incredibly difficult to achieve between having some personal space (when the standard living situation is tenement and shared, college-esque, except we’re not college age anymore) and being “open.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have recently moved out of that mansion into what would be normal to me.  Luckily enough it is also what would be normal to a middle-class Somali.  Instead of ten bedrooms (some of which were office space), I now have three.  Instead of having to walk 15 minutes to get to the kitchen, it now takes me 15 seconds.  I don’t have to worry about staff all of the time as I only have someone who comes to clean for me a few days a week &amp;amp; when I’m at the office.  It is safer this way, as you are a target when you live in a mansion.  You can do what you like without having to worry about being disturbed.  You can metaphorically unpack your bags.  You can find normality in an otherwise frantic existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The place I’m living now actually feels like a home rather than a dorm.  And that is fantastic.  I love my old roommates dearly, but it is so nice to have something that is “yours.”  And when my wife comes down next year for a bit, my life will be complete!&lt;/p>

This series explores those differences.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![want need syrup by thebrianmeyer @ flickr][2]][2]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every development worker I’ve ever met, and I can say with confidence, without exception, hates the following phrase with a passion: “What we &lt;em>really&lt;/em> need is….”  Hearing that phrase pretty much ruins your entire day.  Usually, but not always, it is accompanied by a veiled threat of what will happen if the particular worker does not comply.  Well, that happens when one is dealing with governmental clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a preliminary (and because despite my non-traditional path I am still a trained lawyer), let me define what I’m talking about when I say “wants” and “needs.”  I would define (for the purposes of this piece only, &lt;em>see supra&lt;/em>) “needs” as those things which are required to perform a given task, whereas I would define “wants” as those things which are not required but would be beneficial to accomplish a given task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do I “need” internet to survive? No.   Do I “need” internet to do my job? Yes (reasons for this answer will be detailed in a forthcoming post).  I say this almost flippantly, but in any culture it is incredibly easy to conflate these concepts and trying to differentiate between the two will depend largely upon an individual’s perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially when it comes to legislative action, determining whether a mechanism or a “thing” is needed or wanted is incredibly difficult to determine with accuracy.  One of the arts of political action is convincing others of one’s perspective as to whether something is a needed requirement or a wanted luxury.  This is one of  the many reasons why so many politicians are trained lawyers – as we get paid to use words to twist concepts to convince individuals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, when it comes to Somali society figuring out such a differential is complicated by the Somali language.  In Somali, to say “I want X” one would say “X waan doonayaa,” whereas to say “I need X” one would say “X waan doonayaa.”  The root of the verb (“doon”) means both of the concepts expressed in the English words “want” and “need.”  It isn’t a far leap to see that this makes it even more difficult to differentiate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first time I was running a workshop here in Hargeisa talking to legislators about the differences in these concepts my translator was struggling and I was having a hard time understanding why it was difficult to pose the question to the participants.  At the break I pulled my translator aside and tried to figure out why he was having such trouble getting across what I was trying to say.  He was also extremely frustrated but didn’t say much other than he would do his best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Months later, when I was learning Somali, it became clear to me that the difficulty my translator had experienced much earlier was a function of the Somali language.  After I had learned a modicum of Somali than I changed some of the curriculum of the workshop from wants and needs to requirements and luxuries.  After that it was much easier for my translator to get the preliminary concepts across so that the participants could have a good discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my favorite all time stories during my years here in Somaliland falls (loosely) under this concept of wants v. needs.  In October, 2008, there were three suicide bombs detonated in different places here in Hargeisa: the Ethiopian Embassy, the UNDP compound, and the Presidential mansion.  After these bombings there were probably four of us expatriates who stuck around while everyone else ran away to Nairobi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My team and I worked day and night for the two weeks after the bombings preparing a series of documents to help the government and parliament understand the legal mechanisms for reacting to terrorism that have been emplaced under (1) international law; and (2) national laws within the region.  The government told me very early on that they were looking to emplace something like the Somaliland Patriot Act and so we had done tons of research on the topic for the government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We broke up the delivery of the work product among the different affected clients: namely the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Justice.  I was in with the Minister of Justice briefing him on the current problems that they would have if they wanted to prosecute suspected terrorists under their current penal code.  I had included in my briefing a bunch on due process as well as the international human rights mechanisms, which had been imputed into the Somaliland Constitution, that currently limited their ability to move forward with prosecutions prior to further legislative action.  About 2/3d’s of the way through my presentation the Vice Minister of Justice barged into the briefing and sat down.  He waited for about thirty seconds before he turned to me and said the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is all well and good, but what Somaliland really *needs *is you to call up the CIA and brief them on what is happening here.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Seriously, Mr. Vice Minister, do you really think that I have the CIA’s number on my speed dial?  My sarcastic side said.  For once, I controlled that and tried my best to explain in a temperate tone that I had no contacts with the CIA and that even if I did they wouldn’t listen to me.  I caught the Minister’s eyes rolling slightly while the Vice Minister was on his tirade after my response so I knew I was on OK ground and I just moved along with my briefing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After we finished, and we were leaving the Vice Minister (who I had never spoken to once prior to this exchange) walked out to our vehicle with us.  He told me that he knew exactly who I was and that he was going to hold me personally liable for informing the CIA of what was happening here in Somaliland.  I assured him in the most even tones I could conjure at that moment that there was nothing I could do for him on this issue and that he should use the Minister of Foreign Affairs rather than some external NGO worker.  He was never convinced.  And I wasn’t convinced that he was mentally stable enough to be a Vice Minister.  I left completely flabbergasted.  To this day, there is no Somaliland Patriot Act.&lt;/p>

To understand the significance of this event, one must understand the road that it has taken the Somalilanders to get to this point. This election has been delayed for over two years. This entry contains a small background on the three men on the ballot.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.ucidparty.com/">&lt;img src="http://www.ucidparty.com/" alt="UCID Chairman Faisal Ali Warabe via Sallaxleynews @ flickr">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="contender-a-faisal-ali-warabe-chairman-ucid-party">Contender A: Faisal Ali “Warabe” Chairman UCID Party&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Faisal and his &lt;a href="http://www.ucidparty.com/">UCID party&lt;/a> have long been seen as the also rans in Somaliland politics.  But UCID seems to have found some resonance in its argument this term and seems to have a growing cadre of supporters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Name:  Faisal Ali “Warabe.” **“Warabe” means hyena in Somali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Clan: Ciidagaale.&lt;/strong> The Ciidagale are a small-ish (but not a minority) clan within the Somaliland clans.  They are a subclan of the Isaaq who are the majority clan within Somaliland.  The Ciidagaale have a kinship-alliance with one of the major clans within Somaliland politics of the past ten years: the Habar Yunis.  This kinship-alliance is called the Galhajis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ciidagaale see themselves as the linkage between the major Isaaq subclans from the west of Somaliland (namely the Habar Awal kinship-alliance between the Issa Muse and Sa’ad Muse) and those in the east of Somaliland (namely their “brethren” from the Galhajis as well as the Habar Jaclo).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These two items (their relatively small size and their geographical position between the major players) have long given the Ciidagaale an outsized view of themselves.  They have always played with the big boys, indeed for hundreds of years before and during British colonialism their sultan was one of  the most powerful in all of the northern Somali regions.  They claim that they ruled Somaliland for 500 years, but it is a bit more complicated than that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="strengths">Strengths:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not one of the two major players&lt;/strong>.  This underdog position has allowed UCID to campaign nearly without the hassles that the other two “major” parties have had to cope with.  Most of the shots which UDUB and KULMIYE fire across one another’s bows (including claims and counterclaims of terrorist affiliation) are irrelevant to UCID.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Relatively free from the baggage of the SNM / Siad Barre conflict.&lt;/strong> Most Somaliland youth don’t really understand the SNM conflict except in a historical context.  To them this was something that happened before and it does not have the viscerality that it likely had in the prior Presidential elections.  Claims and counterclaims between UDUB and KULMIYE as to whether the prevalence of old SNM fighters who “liberated” Somaliland are waning as a relevant point within Somaliland politics as the years pass.  UCID, who is seen as largely free of this baggage, is in a good position to capitalize on this by pulling in those who see membership in SNM as a hindrance rather than a selling point.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Intellectual vigor.&lt;/strong> The team that Faisal has assembled within the UCID network contains some of the better intellectuals around Somaliland.  This is recognized as a positive by most people that I’ve talked to. UCID seems to have an energy that the other two parties do not have.  Although, this positioning, which is populist in nature, has likely not brought the finances into the campaign coffers required to deal with contingencies after the voting.  They have been very effective at targeting two major centers of the Somaliland electorate: women voters and younger voters.  Most of the rallies held by UCID have seen a larger proportion of woman than any of  the other two parties (from my limited perspective at least).  This definitely will set UCID up for long term success, even if they fail to win this election.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Not one of the major players.&lt;/strong> UCID’s outsider status is also their major weakness.  They have a difficult time capitalizing on the winds which blow through the Somaliland deserts because it is difficult for many to visualize their party in power.  They have difficulty dominating any news cycles or forging forward with their own spin on a given situation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Wishy-Washy.&lt;/strong> Faisal is seen as wishy-washy by the Somaliland electorate.  I must say that while I understand where they are coming from, I think personally much of this comes from Faisal’s position in between the other two major players.  He is forced into a difficult position where he is required to mediate likely more than he would prefer due to his “third party” status.  This centrist positioning comes across as wishy-washy.  It is unfortunate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.xisbigaudub.com/">&lt;img src="http://www.xisbigaudub.com/" alt="UDUB Chairman and Incumbent President of Somaliland, Dahir Kahin Riyale via Swiatoslaw Wojtkowiak @ flickr">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="contender-b-dahir-kahin-riyale-chairman-udub-party-incumbent-president">Contender B: Dahir Kahin Riyale, Chairman UDUB Party, Incumbent President&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Riyale and his &lt;a href="http://www.xisbigaudub.com/">UDUB party&lt;/a> have been in power, more or less, since Somaliland declared its independence from Mogadishu and handed over power to a civilian government in the early 1990′s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Name: Dahir Kahin Riyale.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Clan: Gaadabursi.&lt;/strong> The Gaadabursi are a western clan within Somaliland.  They are probably the largest non-Isaaq clan within Somaliland.  There are some other larger non-Isaaq clans, but the majority of these clans are located outside of Somaliland.  Many feel that having a non-Isaaq President has been beneficial to help keep the Isaaq from imploding and fighting with one another during the years of instability of the 2000′s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many other Isaaq’s feel that having a non-Isaaq President has given too much power to minority clans within Somaliland.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="strengths-1">Strengths:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Incumbent.&lt;/strong> Let’s be honest.  This is Africa.  The incumbent has numerous advantages that any incumbent would normally have, but also those that may not be available to non-African incumbents.  Already possessing the state gives access to finances that are not available to others within the country.  As Gettleman pointed out in yesterday’s &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/26/world/africa/26somaliland.html?hp">piece&lt;/a> for the New York Times, sometimes the voting isn’t what matters, but what happens afterward.  For the afterwards, being the incumbent is a distinct advantage.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Experience.&lt;/strong> Many Somalilanders will endlessly debate whether the Riyale administration has done enough on the development front to get a new chance to run the country.  That said, most Somalilanders will concede that as far as experience governing the current team assembled by Riyale cannot be matched.  Although there are many former Ministers and government officials within KULMIYE’s team, and although UCID brings a lot of intellectual firepower to their team, pure raw experience seems to still be having a decent amount of resonance with those I speak to here in Hargeisa.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Continuity. **If Riyale were to stay there would be some continuity to the governing system.  Riyale has proffered two arguments in his favor.  The first is similar to the argument Rove was making in 2004, don’t change horses in the middle of the war.  The Riyale administration has made a big deal out of the current and impending conflict with al-Shabaab operatives that continue to hound Somaliland.  They have argued that they have the right team to tackle this problem.  The second argument has no analogy in American politics, but it is essentially: “we’re already fat, they are skinny, who will really take less from the state coffers.”  For a while this seemed to carry a good amount of weight with the electorate, but has largely been sidelined over the weeks leading up to the election.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="weaknesses-1">Weaknesses:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Background &amp;amp; Baggage.&lt;/strong> Riyale is a former intelligence officer for Siad Barre.  He was not aligned with the SNM, and he sometimes has had to distinguish aside these two arguments.  His response has oscillated between the extremes of hiring lots of SNM veterans and by trying to marginalize the SNM veterans.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Engagement Level. **Many question Riyale’s engagement within Somaliland.  Since his wife mostly lives in Paris with their children rather than in Somaliland, lots of voters that I have spoken with have wondered how much Riyale genuinely cares about Somaliland.  He has had to simultaneously deflect attacks that ironically have sought to portray his administration as (1) autocratic, and (2) blind.  While I have seen the evidence pointed to by opposition members in this regard, it is Africa and there will always be some conflating of a Presidential seat vested in institutions with a Kingdom vested in the personality.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.kulmiye.com/">&lt;img src="http://www.kulmiye.com/" alt="Kulmiye Chairman, Ahmed Mohamed Mohamud &amp;ldquo;Silanyo&amp;rdquo; via Berberanews.com @ flickr">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="contender-c-ahmed-mohamed-mohamud-silanyo-chairman-of-the-kulmiye-party">Contender C: Ahmed Mohamed Mohamud “Silanyo” Chairman of the Kulmiye Party&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Silanyo and his &lt;a href="http://www.kulmiye.com/">Kulmiye party&lt;/a> are largely seen as the primary rivals for the Presidency against Riyale. In the last Presidential election Silanyo lost to Riyale by 80 votes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Name: Ahmed Mohamed Mohmoud “Silanyo”&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Clan: Habar Jaclo.&lt;/strong> The Habar Jaclo are one of the largest Isaaq sub-clans in Somaliland.  They traditionally have occupied the farthest east of the Somaliland Isaaq clans, from Burco all the way to Ceerigavo and almost to Las Anood.  This is significant for two reasons.  First, Burco has traditionally felt second-city syndrome to Hargeisa since the British colonial time.  Second, as one of the largest subclans of the majority clan, Habar Jaclo can appeal to parts of the Isaaq electorate that none of the other candidates can due to their majority (semi-majority) status.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of the Habar Jaclo feel that this is their time, that they have waited as the other major Isaaq clans have had opportunities within the governance framework that they have not had access to (which is a bit of gamesmanship but that is beside the point for how they feel).  They are a tough clan and have shown little hesitation in the past to fight for what they feel they deserve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="strengths-2">Strengths:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Effective usage of Obama Change Mantra.&lt;/strong> Kulmiye has been exceedingly effective at hijacking the change mantra.  This is hilarious to me, as most of the team within Kulmiye are retreads from prior administrations – either from the SNM times or the post-SNM UDUB days.  However, they have convinced a large portion of the population that they will be the most effective vehicle for change.  This has allowed them to leverage growing discontentment with the current state of Somaliland as a factor in their favor – although many of them were involved in setting the preconditions or implementation of many of the policies they now argue against.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Post-Clanism.&lt;/strong> Another ironic, but effective, political tactic that has been used by the Kulmiye team is to preach post-clanism.  This is also ironic as many Somalilanders feel that among the three parties, Kulmiye is by far the most tied to various clan networks.  I have  no opinion as I’ve never met many of the Kulmiye officials, but certainly they have had that reputation for a long time.   The simple fact that most Habar Jaclo feel that this is their time and that Silanyo, being Habar Jaclo, is their vehicle for political success argues against the post-clanism rhetoric which has been effectively utilized by Kulmiye.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Crowd-sourcing&lt;/strong>.  Kulmiye, among the three parties, has probably had the greatest ability to leverage populism embedded in African big-crowd politics.  They have very energized supporters, especially among the middle-aged former SNM fighters who see their old colonels and central party members as those now wearing suits and up for Ministerial positions and other positions if Kulmiye were to win.   They also have been very effective at energizing supporters among the youth.  Those that have not gone with UCID have largely gone with Kulmiye.  Lastly, Kulmiye seems to understand the power of a crowd and routinely buses in large amounts of supporters before their rallies in order to create a scene which has an undeniable magnetic effect in the Somali world-view.  All of these show an understanding of political process, but I still have seen little evidence that their policies will be effectively implemented.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="weaknesses-2">Weaknesses:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Baggage&lt;/strong>.  As with Riyale, Silanyo comes with his own (very large) baggage.  As the oldest of the three men, and a long-time politician within Somali/Somaliland circles, Silanyo has a long and well-known history.  Silanyo was one of the driving forces behind the formation, training, and equipping of SNM.  However, he was ousted as Chairman soon before SNM’s reentry into Somaliland.  Many claim that this ousting was due to Silanyo cutting a last minute deal with Siad for SNM not to attack Somalia and for the Isaaq to be given more autonomy.  I have no opinion on the truthiness of this claim, however it is a widely disseminated rumor and has made many Somalilanders I’ve talked to question Silanyo’s patriotism and his willingness to make a difficult decision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Retreads&lt;/strong>.  Much of Silanyo’s team has been there before.  Many were leaders among the SNM and / or the post-SNM UDUB administrations of Egal and Riyale.  In many voters’ eyes this is seen as a negative.  Many within this team are felt to be hardliners that may fight before negotiating.  Whether this is true or not, it is certainly the feeling among a percentage of the Somaliland electorate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>After discussing some of the background and the personas involved in the election, in this final installment I would like to discuss the arguments that have been raised by each of the three parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are not that complex, so if they seem as if I’ve shortened innumerable hours of speeches by politicians into slogans blithely, let me respond that it is without blitheness and really all I’ve done is distilled the hours of speeches into their core by taking out all of the repetitive words and colorful adjectives which are used by the protagonists with the microphones.  I’ve also tried my best to take out the facial inaccuracies that I see within their arguments, such as &lt;a href="http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Opinion_20/Somaliland_KULMIYE_Formidable_Opposition_Party_or_Troublous_Rebel_Group.shtml">this particular article&lt;/a> (from the Kulmiye camp).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Today Somaliland is holding its Presidential elections.  To understand the significance of this event, one must understand the road that it has taken the Somalilanders to get to this point.  This election has been delayed for over two years.  This entry contains a small background on that time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Presidential elections were originally scheduled for August, 2008.  In April 2008, the Council of Elders – Somaliland’s upper house of Parliament (the Guurti) – extended the term of the President until April 6, 2009.  In April 2008, the NEC released a press statement indicating that the elections would take place as originally scheduled and that the Guurti did not have the authority to unilaterally delay the timeline for the elections as the original timeline had been agreed to by all political parties and the House of Representatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result of mounting tensions, the President agreed to meet with the leaders of the two opposition parties to negotiate a solution. The negotiations among the parties continued for approximately six weeks, when the three political parties and the NEC held a press conference and ceremony to sign the agreement which appeared to have formally resolved the election dispute. The main points of the agreement were that the presidential election would be held before the President’s term expires on April 6, 2009. The NEC originally scheduled the election to be held on March 29, 2009.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On September 23, 2008, NEC announced that it was accepting applications for temporary workers to administer the voter registration program.  Potential applicants were to attend screening interviews at NEC’s office in Hargeisa, Somaliland.  Several hundred applicants gathered outside the office and an adjacent hotel.  The gathering began to grow agitated upon learning that only several dozen positions would be available.  The police attempted to disperse an increasingly tense situation by firing several gunshots into the air.  Two days later NEC continued the screening process without further incident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On August 24-26, 2008, a dispute arose within the main opposition party, Kulmiye, over the rules of procedure for electing the party’s candidates for President during the Kulmiye party conference.  Before the conference began several candidates had emerged to oppose the current party chairman and previous Kulmiye Presidential candidate, Ahmed “Silanyo” Mahmoud Mohamed.   These challengers withdrew prior to the party conference in apparent recognition of their slim chances to defeat the incumbent party chairman.  Kulmiye reconciled its differences sometime in the middle of October.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The National Election Commission (NEC) conducted a voter awareness-raising drive during the first week of October, 2008 prior to beginning the actual registration process.  In the midst of this, there was a dispute within the NEC, with four members voting to oust the Chairman of the NEC.  It was never clear what the dispute was centered on, but a settlement was worked out soon thereafter to retain the present NEC Chairman in a meeting between the NEC and the three political parties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The voter registration process began in the northern port city of Berbera on October 14 and concluded there on October 21.  After Berbera, the voter registration teams moved to Borama and Gabiley for registration of the regions west of Hargeisa.  Hargeisa region, the largest region, was originally scheduled to register voters starting October 28 through to November 3, 2009.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On October 29, 2008, three explosions occurred in Hargeisa.  All three were the result of vehicle suicide bombs.  A group named al-Shabaab claimed credit for the bombings.  Al-Shabaab is a group that claims to have linkages with al Qaeda and has been waging an insurgency in South-Central Somalia for many years.  Although they were known to have operatives in Somaliland throughout their history, this was the first time they acted in such a large-scale and sophisticated fashion.  The Somaliland government quickly and efficiently rooted out many of the remnants of al-Shabaab’s network within Somaliland and brought into custody individuals who have some level of suspected involvement.  More importantly perhaps, the Somaliland citizenry unequivocally rejected al-Shabaab, and many moderate Islamic Clerics spoke out against the attacks and expressed solidarity with the victims and with the Somaliland government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Somaliland national security apparatus continued to maintain a high state of alert against information relating to ongoing threats.  Specifically, Somaliland officials have reportedly received and responded to numerous pieces of information at various times regarding imminent threats of attack or infiltrations by members of al-Shabaab’s network.  While no such attacks transpired after the initial wave of bombs, throughout this time there was a heightened threat environment and the Somaliland government appeared to be taking all available measures within its capacity to pursue these threats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due to the Hargeisa bombings there were a few delays in the registration process for the regions that were originally scheduled to follow Hargeisa region.  The first delay was due to the actual bombings.  The second delay was for staff training as the expatriates supporting the registration effort with information technology services were recalled by their companies and the local Somaliland staff had to be trained.  As a result, voter registration began on December 1 in Hargeisa.  Following the Hargeisa region, the NEC moved towards the eastern regions where it continued with the voter registration process.  The registration teams first went to Burao, the capital of the Togdheer region, followed shortly thereafter in the Sanaag region on December 30, 2008, and then concluded in Sool region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somaliland government officials describe the voter registration process as an overwhelming success.  Over 1 million people were registered, according to Somaliland officials, with many Somalilanders presently residing in Bossasso, Puntland reportedly even returning across the border just to register.  Previous population estimates of Somaliland were about 3.5 million, with roughly 30% of that population, or 1.3 million, estimated to be of eligible voting age.  Therefore, the figure of over 1 million voters registered seems close to legitimate. The NEC announced on January 12, 2009 that it had successfully completed the first phase of the voter registration process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As expected, the leaders of both the UDUB and UCID parties were nominated as the Presidential candidate for their respective party in the spring of 2009.  The ruling party, UDUB, nominated the incumbent President as its party’s nominee for the upcoming Presidential election.  The weaker of the two opposition parties, UCID, nominated its chairman, Faisal Ali Warabe, to be its party’s nominee for the upcoming Presidential election.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In February, NEC replaced its chairman.  The preceding chairman resigned on February 2, 2009 from his chairmanship but remained a commissioner.  The new chairman, Mr. Jama Mohamed, entered his position soon thereafter.  On February 23, 2009 NEC announced that it would not be able to hold the elections on the prior agreed date of March 29, 2009.  NEC stated that because of the high number of multiple registrants it would not be able to complete the verification of its database in time.  NEC used computerized software alongside digitized fingerprints and facial photos to identify persons who had registered multiple times.  The complicated computer algorithm that was used to “purge” the database of multiple registrants required outside consultants and extensive computing power – both of which took some time for NEC to acquire.  Additionally, there was a political dispute over the analysis of multiple registrants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time when NEC announced that it would not be able to make the March 29 election date, it had yet to complete the identification of multiple registrants.  Following NEC’s announcement that it would be unable to meet the March 29 election date, Kulmiye announced that it would not acknowledge the legitimacy of the current government beyond its allotted mandate – which was set to expire on April 6, 2009.  Kulmiye announced that it would only accept a unified caretaker regime from April 6 until the election was complete.  UDUB, the ruling party, refused to accept any government of unification.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both parties finally compromised by sending the decision to the Guurti.  After an intense political battle, the Guurti announced on March 28, 2009 that it was extending the President’s mandate another six months, which in turn, extended UDUB’s ability to legally rule Somaliland until October 6, 2009.  Soon thereafter, in the first week of April, NEC announced that it would hold the election on September 27, 2009.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the first week of April, Kulmiye announced that despite its earlier call to submit the extension of the Presidential mandate to the Guurti, the eventual decision by the Guurti was unconstitutional.  Kulmiye continued to claim that it would not accept UDUB’s legality to rule Somaliland after April 6, 2009.  The party made many claims during this period that it would resort to violence which never came to fruition.  On May 27, 2009 all three of the political parties finally accepted the decision of the mediation committee that the extension of the incumbent’s term by the Guurti, was constitutionally valid and that the election could be held on September 27, 2009.  The leaders of the three parties signed a memorandum of agreement enshrining their current desire to hold the election on that date.  One of the major reasons for the numerous delays was the continued technical difficulties in analyzing the database of registered voters and purging those who registered more than once.  Sometime around the 10th of June, this issue was thought finalized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Running parallel to the political haggling over the Presidential elections was another battle over control of the Guurti.  On two occasions, first in the middle of February and second at the end of March, 2009 the Guurti brought forward motions to oust the current chairman of the Guurti, Suliman Mahmoud Adan.  Both challenges to the chairman were attributed to his perceived political allegiance to the chairman of Kulmiye, Silanyo.  On both occasions the opposition to the chairman was not able to acquire the quorum of two-thirds of the Guurti constitutionally required to unseat a sitting chairman.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The NEC had its own internal problems during the summer of 2009.  Two of the Commissioners were accused of corruption sometime around June 12 and were sacked by the NEC Chairman about a week later.  Since both of the sacked Commissioners had been appointed by the House of Representatives, that House was vested with the task of replacing them.  Rather than replacing the Commissioners at this late date in the election process, the House decided sometime around the 23rd of June to send the Commissioners back to NEC, despite the corruption allegation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The political gamesmanship between the Government and opposition parties, the Parliament, the National Election Commission (NEC), and the international donors escalated towards the end of July, again jeopardizing the prospects for the election on the scheduled date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementing international NGO, InterPeace, supporting the election process in Somaliland was determined to resolve the technical difficulties associated with the voter registration database and released the final voter registration list to the NEC by July 27.  On July 28 the international donors, providing support to both InterPeace and the presidential elections, announced that the voter list had been released to the NEC on July 27 as agreed, and alleged that the NEC was holding up the process by not releasing the list to the political parties and the general public.  Later that same day, the NEC responded with an announcement that the voter list submitted to them had not resolved the ongoing technical difficulties and was therefore invalid.  The NEC announced further that the election would be conducted on the scheduled date, but without utilizing the voter registration list.  The donors responded with another press announcement that they would withdraw support for the election if the voter registration list was discarded by the NEC.  Meanwhile, the chairmen of both houses of parliament, along with the opposition parties, backed the international donors and announced that the election must only be conducted using the voter registration list.  However, the NEC and Somaliland Government held firm that the election would be conducted without the voter registration list, even going so far as to deport some of InterPeace’s international staff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout August of 2009, the political parties and the National Election Commission (NEC) remained at loggerheads over the decision about whether to hold the election without the voter registration database.  Toward the end of the month, the President decided that the election would take place without the voter list.  This decision inflamed the opposition parties and operated as a catalyst for many relationships to fracture.  The first fissure was between the three parties.  August 3 was the date established by NEC for the political parties to begin campaigning.  On that day, the two opposition parties announced that they would boycott the election if the President continued to maintain his intransigence regarding the voter list.  Meanwhile, the ruling party held rallies for their candidate.  The following day the opposition parties announced, via their MPs, that they would seek the impeachment of the incumbent President.  They cited the Presidential intent to hold the election without the voter list and other unconstitutional actions by the President as their reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drama between the political parties and the President was acted out on two stages.  The first stage was between the Presidential candidates, who participated in numerous mediation committee meetings to resolve their differences regarding whether or not the voter registration list was to be used.  The second stage was between the President and opposition MPs.  On August 15, the Parliament passed a decree allowing the elections to continue as planned without using the list, despite arguments that doing so would be contrary to the Voter Registration Act.  The back and forth between the opposition and ruling parties culminated in at the end of August with an assassination attempt on the Speaker of the House of Representatives by one of the MPs. The Speaker escaped into a prepositioned rally of anti-government supporters.  Following this, pro-government MPs sought the removal of the Speaker.  Meanwhile, anti-government MPs continued to seek the impeachment of the President.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to the tensions within the Parliament, numerous other tensions were operating within Somaliland over the course of August.  The President and NEC found themselves in a battle with many external actors over the timing and conduct of the election.  On August 20, the Ethiopian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs arrived in Hargeisa in an effort to mediate the differences among the parties on these two issues.  He proved to be unsuccessful in his efforts.  After the Minister departed, a delegation from the African Union arrived in Hargeisa with a similar mission.  Finally, on August 29th, a British diplomat from the UK’s embassy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia arrived.  All of these missions were unsuccessful and there was no agreement or clarity with regards to the timing and conduct of the Presidential election at the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In early September, the National Election Commission (NEC) announced that they would be unable to conduct the elections as scheduled on September 27, 2009.  They did not announce a new timetable for when they would be able to conduct the elections.   Toward the end of September, 2009, the President’s mandate was expiring and all of the issues surrounding the election remain unsolved.  On the morning of the day the election was supposed to take place the Guurti finally was able to broker a deal.  The Guurti extended the President’s term indefinitely, but required him to hold the elections in good faith as soon as feasible.  The pro-government supporters agreed to drop their insistence on removing the Speaker of the House, while the anti-government supporters agreed to drop their impeachment motion against the President.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the first week of October, the seven Commissioners from the National Election Commission (NEC) resigned under domestic and international pressure.  The second and third weeks of October saw seven new Commissioners nominated by the various stakeholders in the process.  Although there was a significant amount of political discourse on the selection of the new NEC, the prior animosity between the various political factions was largely absent from the process.  On October 21, the President forwarded the list of the new Commissioners to the House of Representatives.  On October 24, the House approved the list.  They were sworn in the following week.  The turnover from the old Commissioners to the new Commissioners took place during the first weeks of November.  The new NEC began their work and meetings during November.  They spent a significant portion of the month in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia meeting with donors and participating in training seminars.  NEC returned to Hargeisa from their meetings abroad during the latter part of December.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The NEC came under pressure throughout the early part of 2010 to fix a date for the elections.  The new NEC shied away from media attention and focused itself in the practicalities of conducting elections.  The legal mandate of the 2007 Voter Registration Act placed the NEC in difficult position, as it was required to use the database, but the database it inherited from the previous NEC was largely unusable.  Subsequently, Interpeace sent technicians to try to recover the data that is either lost or in the wrong form.  This effort was largely successful, and the NEC was able to publish the voter list for the political parties in late March without incident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The NEC spent most of February planning polling station locations and resolving the final technical issues with the voter registration database.  Around the 25th of February information was leaked to the press that the NEC would not be ready to hold the presidential election until the end of the year and that they would distribute new voter registration cards in each region to voters who had not registered twice.  The news was not met with much tension in Hargeisa.  However, later in the quarter different information circulated that the election would take place in June or July of 2010.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Guurti experienced more turmoil during the early part of 2010.  The Chairman of the House left Somaliland in December and went to the United Kingdom for routine medical treatment.  While the Chairman was away, motions were brought before the House to change the by-laws to reduce the current super-majority required to oust a sitting chairman to a simple majority.  Many members of the House felt that this was a first step toward deposing the current Chairman, and members quickly began taking sides on the issue.  When the Chairman returned on January 12, 2010, he immediately began working to resolve the conflict.  In late January, the Deputy Chairman, who was widely seen as the heir apparent to the Chairman’s post if he was ousted, announced his resignation.  This again caused polarization in the House, with numerous back and forth accusations and rebuttals from both camps[[LB4]][2] [[CSK5]][3] .  After more political mediation, the Deputy Chairman retracted his resignation and was reinstated by the plenary chamber of the House.  Both camps agreed to keep the bylaws as they were.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Early in April, 2010 the Chairman of the Ghanaian National Election Commission visited and assisted the Somaliland National Election Commission (NEC) in the various preparations necessary for the election.  On April 29 the NEC held a press conference where they confirmed that they would be ready to hold the election in June, 2010.  NEC has prepared all of the polling stations, ordered and accepted the delivery of the ballot boxes, and has delivered the approved and finalized voter registration cards to the electorate.  In May, 2010 the NEC announced that the Presidential elections would take place on June 26, 2010.  The campaigns for the elections began without significant tension on June 5, 2010 and have continued without any significant disruption up to the time of this report.&lt;/p>

This series explores those differences.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have lived &amp;amp; worked with Somalis here in Somaliland for over two years now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have, like many expats before me, sat in rooms on the floor with rugs underneath us cushions behind our backs, mauis’s (skirts) on sporting wife-beaters drinking the sweetest teas one has ever drank and (as my wife likes to say) sticking green leaves up our noses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equally I have sat many nights, like many expats before me, on a veranda, a glass of wine in hand, cool breezes of Hargeisa swirling around, dressed in jeans and semi-glamorous (but always purposively casual) shirts, some ipod attached to portable speakers, listening to music that is on the verge of being hip back home and talking about the deep cultural differences between us and those that fill our daily lives (our clients, our friends, our colleagues, people we meet around).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have had a steady turnover in Hargeisa of expatriates lately.  And over that time there seems to be an increasing amount of tension between the expatriates and the Somalilanders.  I am not sure exactly why this seems to be happening (because this is Somaliland it is spoken of in metaphors and resides fully in the subtextual zone), but it has become increasingly tangible to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the course of the past year there has been this tit-for-tat between the powerful voices for the expatriates and the powerful voices for the Somalilanders.  The problem is that those of us who aren’t given powerful voices become batted around as the game is played by others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Something happened to me recently which I would like to use (again cloaked in metaphor and subtext, because this is how to communicate in Somaliland) as a tuusaale (example).  One of my best expat friends here in Hargeisa (who is a development worker) recently had some professional dealings with one of my best Somali friends (who is a mid-level government employee).  Due to forces above and beyond either’s control the dealings did not turn out well and both became frustrated by the situation (for very different reasons but that is beside the point).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a while I was caught in the middle of everything but the biggest problem was that I was getting completely different stories as to what happened from either “side” (so to say).  There was so little alignment between the stories that for a while I wondered if these were two completely different situations involving different people completely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later I started to piece it together, to connect the people that were being referenced by one story with how I organize those relationships when I’m talking to the other side, to connect the things that I knew were more important to one side with those that had little emphasis in the other’s side of the story.  I don’t know much about mediation, but I was trying to see these events through each side’s cultural lens and come to some sort of objective understanding of what likely transpired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was only after spending literally hours trying to dig through and cross-check and re-examine and then start all over again that I was able to ferret out what may have actually happened.  And only after that did I realize that the actualities of the situation were out of the control of either party.  That happens in development work and it is one of the occupational hazards of this work.  However, the relational aspects of the situation were very much aggravated by the cultural differences between the parties.  It is this part – the cultural misunderstandings and their attendant relational aspects which causes (in my mind) undue hardships in development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why I wanted to write a few words over the course of the next little while trying to tell a few stories that have taught me a ton about humanity and culture (and which is which).  A few stories which I think of and use when I’m trying to analyze things through a foreign cultural lens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I had to pick one of the most intellectually satisfying aspects of working here in Somaliland, it has been the opportunity to dig deep into a culture and a way of thinking and seeing the world that is very different than my own.  Each of the cultural differences, while stark at times, belies evidence of our common humanity.  Every time I become frustrated with the cultural differences then something will happen to me which will reinforce the common humanity which is always there.  The tenderness of a father’s reprimand, or a shared joke, or an extraordinarily kind act.  These things accompany each and every one of the cultural differences.  So I hope to share a few of these stories along the way as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I first arrived here in S’land, and I would go out to eat, I would use the minimum amount of water possible to wash my hands before and after eating with them.  It is desert afterall.  But later, towards the end I realized that I had adapted and was using more water – letting the water run as I was soaping, washing my face also.  It was never a conscious decision, I just started using more water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But here at the house, I have always remained conscious of how much water we are using – primarily because at the house we have to pay for the water and it is EXPENSIVE. It is desert afterall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I just wanted to share a bit about how the water works.  Here in Hargeisa we have a decent supply of water, but it is getting strained by the continuing population growth of the city.  There is this beautiful area about 30 km to the north of Hargeisa, in the Golis Mountains where most of the water comes from.  One of the main problems is that the area is a couple hundred meters of elevation lower than Hargeisa.  That means PUMPS generators performing the difficult job of getting the water up here to Hargeisa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Hargeisa Water Agency has identified two other locations which could supply Hargeisa and both are higher and would require less pumping power.  The problem is getting the infrastructure built.  The Agency has a difficult time amassing enough capital to even upgrade the pipe network from the original series of wells into Hargeisa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the water gets to Hargeisa then it gets routed to different zones.  Typically one or two zones within Hargeisa will get water on a given night, and then the Agency will rotate zones over the course of the week.  Once the water is released to the zones then the zone manager is responsible for routing it into particular customers of the agency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The irregularity of the water supply means that most compounds have built their own water reservoirs and then we watch these like a hawk.  Our reservoir is underground.  Because it is a totally passive system, what we have to do is each day we check supplemental tanks which are on the highest part of the house.  These tanks provide the house with water pressure, but do it passively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pretty much each day we pump water from the underground reservoir to the upper holding tanks.  This means that we only have to use the electricity to pump the water up once a day rather than running it continuously (which is important because electricity is also EXPENSIVE).  The system works quite well most of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only problem comes when we let the upper holding tanks run dry.  What happens (because the system is passively pressurized) then is that air runs down through the water lines in the house.  After we fill the upper holding tanks the air pressurizes from the weight of the water above it and keeps the water from flowing through the plumbing system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of you living in Africa may have experienced this problem.  So here is what you do when the water won’t flow through your house.  You go to the bottom most taps in your system and open all of them that you can find.  This will bleed the air pressure from the system.  When those taps are running well, then you can go upstairs and turn one a couple of taps.  This should bleed the rest of the air from the system and then water should fill all of the lines.  Then you have to run around the house turning off all of the taps because you hate wasting water!  You may have to fiddle with your hot water heaters (if you are lucky enough to have them) as they sometimes become a hassle to bleed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this is a small hassle – and after a while it becomes second nature to bleed the lines when you know that the upper tanks have run dry.  This is one of my favorite parts of living in the developing world.  You are forced to learn about the world around you which you so often take for granting living in the developed world where you never have to understand fluid dynamics and watershed elevation limitations in order to take a shower!&lt;/p>

[2]: &lt;a href="http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/wp-content/uploads/ejdr201010a1.pdf">http://www.oxfamblogs.org/fp2p/wp-content/uploads/ejdr201010a1.pdf&lt;/a>
This article spoke to me in a way that not many pieces have recently.  Perhaps it is my transition from an aid receiving NGO worker to the other side of the coin as a private sector social entrepreneur, and the conjunction of the transition with my reading of the article.  Or maybe I am trying to continue to understand a world and a profession which on the surface seems straight-forward (go to Somalia &amp;amp; help) but underneath is complicated, political, and stifles lots of creativity for no reason.
There are many varied reasons for the underlying complications.  Some of the reasons come from other annotated readings that I have put up in the past.  Some of the reasons come from the complications of running world-wide operations with thousands, if not millions of associated partners – not to mentions the hundreds of millions of people involved in the entire operation from politicians, to top-level administrators, to top-level NGO workers, to country-level NGO workers, all the way to the purported beneficiaries of a project.  So, in short, this is a complicated undertaking and requires people who understand complexity theory (an annotated reading which is in the works) and who understand relationships.
The main gist of the piece is that aid should value the relationships which are developed between a recipient population and those individuals mandated with the delivery of the project.  I have always felt that this work requires a complex understanding of the context in which the project is undertaken, and I have always valued the relationships which I have built along the way.  Indeed, the value which I place on those relations is one of the driving forces for my new ventures (see [here][3] and [here][4]).  While I have placed value, as an individual human, on these relationships, I always had this odd feeling whenever I would talk to others within my organization or in donor communities that this was some sort of a remote control SimCity game that had less to do with human beings and more to do with numbers and metrics which never had any application at least in my specific context here in S’land.

That said, I have always been impressed when meeting face-to-face with those in my old organization and in the donor community.  On many levels they are bright, well-intentioned individuals.  So I could never quite put my finger on this divergence.  This piece has filled in many of the gaps for me.  So without further introduction, here is the piece.

&lt;p>I have my quibbles with some of the things he says, but mainly it is a difference of assumption rather than philosophy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This week he wrote a post talking about the ineffectual nature of the stream of “governments”  that have “ruled” Somalia since Siad Barre was thrown from power by a queer arrangement of circumstances and bad decisions.  (Yes, if we were discussing this over a beer I would have used finger quotes around those words.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gerstle’s argument is that Somalia has lacked a visionary unifier that was able to convince a wide-swath of the Somali community to band together.  This is true.  There has been no one.  Likely there will never be one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In history no one has been able to rule Somalis by consent.  Either it is by force or there is controlled anarchy.  And this controlled anarchy is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here in Somaliland there was a group that was able to achieve some of what Gerstle is arguing for, but for a long calculus of reasons that I’m too bored with to go into here and now they were focussed on unifying the people and clans of Somaliland rather than the entirety of the Somali people.  Unfortunately for Somaliland and the rest this group of pragmatic visionaries is dead and no one has stepped up and been able to sell a vision to the Somalilanders of where Somaliland is going and why it should go in that direction.  But where is Somaliland now after the death of the original visionaries?  There is a crazy stew of controlled anarchy spiced up with a bit of controlling top-down authoritarianism just to make the stew interesting and unexpected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though there is a lack of current visionaries, there is no lack of vision which is discussed and debated at nauseum while no one seems to take any steps in any direction – even those directions where everyone agrees.  Yet, despite these challenges, everywhere I look I see hope around me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A young generation is coming up with only knowledge of Somaliland.  They are educated and passionate about unification.  They have links with diaspora who are helping to curb the clanistic tendencies which the older generation feels deeper than the young.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Largely, Somalis and Americans have lots in common.  Especially when you are able to have a philosophical discussion about the role of government in people’s lives.  They are deeply distrustful of the government and very private sector focussed.  They are comedic, warm (after they know you), and pragmatic.  I see so much in common between the problems that Somaliland is facing and the problems that America is facing.  Every day I see the frustrations of people here and read about the frustrations of my friends and family back home.  Although the scale is different, the problems largely stem from the same source: a feeling of distrust in one’s government which should be there to help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a difficult proposition to project what will happen in Somalia or Somaliland.  The problem, as I see it, with the international approaches so far along with the local approaches, is that it is difficult to reconcile the philosophical desires of most Somalis with the history that they have faced in the modern era of authoritarian rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply put authoritarian rule will not work long term in Somalia.  Maybe it will work in more deferential cultures, but Somali culture is about as far from deferential as I’ve every experienced.  Someone, I do not doubt, will come along with a vision of how to reconcile these notions and will actually put into practice the tenants of the Somaliland Constitution which was built quite well as a decentralized structure with dissipated power very similar to the US governance model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Such a visionary, powered by the continued education of most Somalilanders will be the double rainbow which will allow Somaliland to turn the corner.  It will not happen simply by a visionary telling the country what it has to do.  Somalis will rarely accept such orders.  But someone will come along – eventually, inshallah – that will be able to convince people of his or her vision of how to reconcile the dissonance between the historical predicates of Somalia and the cultural desires for decentralized power.  When this unselfish visionary comes along the world should ilaalayaa because these people that I have grown to love will be a powerful force.&lt;/p>

Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf &amp;amp; Hillary Clinton via @FP_Magazine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Madam President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf the current President of Liberia did a remarkable thing yesterday.  She &lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/05/25/liberias_ellen_johnson_sirleaf">told &lt;/a>the world that in ten years Liberia would be self-sufficient and able to stand on its own feet with only further investment &lt;em>and no aid&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In ten years, Liberia will have been out of its civil war for about fifteen or sixteen depending on how one classifies the end.  And if Liberia were to achieve it, they would have accomplished something remarkable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To provide some context Rwanda is now about sixteen years after their conflict.  They have had a President that in many ways can be analogized to Johnson-Sirleaf.  Kagame is pro-business, pro-US, and takes a rational approach to China.  And Rwanda is by all metrics doing very well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But they are not, yet, self-sufficient.  Liberia has distinct advantages that Rwanda does not.  More resources and sea-access are the main advantages.  So it may not be completely accurate to compare the two.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I especially appreciate her stance on China.  Many people in the development world wring their hands about China’s involvement in Africa.  This always comes across to me as protectionism of our fiefdoms.  There is &lt;em>no way that China can teach Africa anything, all they will do is steal their resources&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us not forget that Western companies have been stealing Africa’s resources for years.  I know plenty of Africans who are happy about the way that China interacts with their country.  They feel that the Chinese treat them more equally and less antagonistically than most donor agencies and iNGOs (especially governance iNGOs).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ellen really seems to pinpoint the African meme towards China with this quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“China’s fast,” she explained. “They know what they want and they do it quickly.” Building schools, building roads, signing contracts, and offering loans — all of it can be done in weeks or months, not years as some donors and Western investors might take. In short, “China’s flexible.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And this speed is critical.  Opportunities for reform or development often open and close before Western donors can get an RFP published, much less funded, contracted, distributed, and the agency beginning to reform or development agenda.  China is much quicker, and while Westerners may question their motives, at least their motives are clear to everyone: them and their partners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, this clarity makes it easier for them to operate.  I doubt it is frequent that Chinese in Africa are accused of being spies.  Meanwhile, I have been accused of being a spy nearly every day for two years – something that has deeply affected the receptivity to my work and a story for another day.&lt;/p>

[]: &lt;a href="http://ldasiaclothing.blogspot.com/2009/07/its-my-birthday-ldasia-on.html">http://ldasiaclothing.blogspot.com/2009/07/its-my-birthday-ldasia-on.html&lt;/a>
The dude in the picture has somehow made a business of wearing other people’s shirts.  The guerrilla marketers’ wet dream, perhaps.  All I’ll say about his business model is this: this this the apogee of an economy based on circular illusions; when will we begin to realize that this is a house of cards and what we produce / create / add to the world is an important economic metric.  OK, back to the story.
So dude wears shirts for a living.  I guess there are less useful careers, but at any rate, dude wants to “do some good.”  Dude tells the world to send him your old shirts and he’ll ship them to Africa to put on the backs of naked villagers (or something to that effect).
Then informed development thinkers – the kind that I like who are realistically private sector development leaning while knowledgeable of the principles of stable macroeconomics, microeconomics, social entrepreneurship, and generally doing GOOD – these guys [get ][2]ahold of the idea and utterly rip it to shreds.  (One of my favorite voices, [@TMSRuge][3] called it stupid, but then retreated on Twitter to “half-baked”).  Their argument generally distilled to telling Dude not to be a neo-missionary thinking that putting clothes on people actually does anything other than further skewing teetering economies and displacing cultures of hard work based on good economic principles.  My favorite of the “open letters” etc. is [here][4].

Then it really blew up.  Dude retorts with something akin to the five arguments in [this ][5]nice post from UN Dispatch.

&lt;li>I’m just trying to do good here&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Being mean doesn’t help&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You need to offer constructive suggestions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don’t you have anything better to do than pick on other people&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I’d like to see you do better!
To their credit, the people that I have to side with responded by attempting to crowd source [ideas][6].  You can see a nice run down of the conversation [here][7].  But then an interesting thing happened.  The big heart – small head progenitor of the [#1millionshirts][8] project then started listening to the people who knew more than he.

Although I’m unsure of the outcome it is the process which has fascinated me.  First off the idea &lt;em>is&lt;/em> half-baked and patronistic.  Yet, I’m not interested in the critiques, as the UN Dispatch article points out, the critiques leveraged against the project are very well rehearsed.  I know where they come from on a larger level as a relatively well-informed academically development worker.  But I also see the problems in the brilliant technicolor  that only the desert sun can bring every day of my life as I work on my own side projects and my day job here in Somalia.
What fascinates me is that the world we live in is utterly and truly changing.  As information has sped up and cut out the middle man (editor/censor) things are happening which would have been impossible before: ideas and knowledge, especially good ideas combined with common sense and epistemic authority, are becoming a liquid currency all of their own.  It was truly a two-way street.  The big-heart; big-headed people willing to give their energies and talent to help correct the early mistakes of the big-heart; small-headed project.  To paraphrase Dennis Leary: “it warms my coccals, or maybe in my sub-coccal area.”  And, no, I don’t have any idea how to spell that word.
We development workers are an odd bunch.  Most of the people you meet which come from afar “to help” are really neo-hippies who really creave the yuppy lifestyle with a bit of adventure and nice facebook status updates like “I can’t believe I get to do THIS on a daily basis.”  Likely there will be a picture of a nice house with attentive staff (neo-colonialism defined) rather than some dirty white hands underneath the status update.  But that is a story for another day.
Leaving that rant aside, there are plenty who do care and are willing to learn.  I am reading a book I recently bought in Istanbul called [Soil and Soul][9].  In the introduction is a quote which I love and it applies both to this recent debate as well as to development work in general.  It is a breakdown of a fantastic poem which is worth remembering on the days when everything is falling apart and your local staff is not getting the point and your clients are coming from left and right asking for money you know is going to make their personal house bigger rather than delivering services but you’re in a bind and for many reasons you cannot say no.  We’ve all of us been there in some form or another.  On those days in the future I’ll be thinking of this quote and I encourage you to also:

&lt;/ol>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>There must be more to life, [Hugh MacDiarmid] muses, than for human beings to owe dignity, “their claim to our sympathy, more to their misfortune.”  That “more” is the capacity to see a person’s potential for blossoming: to see what they could be and maybe still can be; not just the limitations of what they presently are.  “And I &lt;em>am&lt;/em>,” MacDiarmid says, emphasizing the words with which he concludes his musings: “And I &lt;em>am concerned with the blossom&lt;/em>.”
Now am off to draw up documents for my own half-baked ideas which I hope are concerned with the blossom!

&lt;p>I desperately wanted to hate &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/opinion/18bono.html?pagewanted=1&amp;amp;hp">this&lt;/a> op-ed which the NYT published yesterday and Bono wrote, but at the end it was a rather good piece.  There is this narrative which is beginning to form which is the first coherent, resonant, and positive narrative on Africa that I’ve heard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bono’s piece encapsulates the narrative quite well actually, but let me summarize.  Africa is getting to get its act together.  Although outliers like here where I live will remain, the rest of the continent (led by countries like Senegal, Ghana, Tanzania, and Botswana) are really moving forward.  Last year was the first time since the 1960s where average per capita income for the entire continent rose.  Arts are flourishing, people are beginning to move up Maslow’s hierarchy which is developing a strong and engaged middle-class.  In summary, it is an exciting time in Africa for all the reasons it has always been exciting, but for new ones too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did like some of the imagery in the piece.  Particularly how at Ghana University Mo Ibrahim was the rock star and Bono was the apprentice.  I like how Bono day dreams of owning NBC and NYT (but I wonder why NBC).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the day, the taste that resides in my mouth is of optimism.  And that, in and of itself is a big step forward. Because the rest of this is going to take work, lots of work and hope will be the fuel of that engine.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This week the World Food Program (WFP) shoved out a &lt;a href="http://www.wfp.org/content/somalia-pirates-target-food-pushing-prices">press release&lt;/a> about how piracy was raising food prices in South-Central Somalia.  At first glance, most people who would read such a report will likely think, oh the poor people in Mogadishu.  Of course, I share their sentiments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is a deeper issue at work here.  One that I’m not sure many people realize.  The conclusion (because I’m a lawyer and we put these things up front) is that this rise in cost of business may have drastically good effects for the conflict in the South.  Here’s how I get there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those brains who study war break themselves into two-sides of the same coin (since they are academics largely they have to classify and camp-ify themselves in order to create non-existent academic conflict to drive conscriptions to their own camp to drive their own popularity to drive their tenure track – but that is a story for a different day).  I’m too lazy to look up what the classifications of the two sides are, but generally one camp focuses on the structural conditions for conflict to begin (guns, poverty, etc.) and another camp focuses on the social conditions for conflict to begin (ethnic diversity, natural resources, etc.).  Or something like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These camps have outlined pretty logical paths for those who seek to mitigate, manage, or militate conflict to follow.  If conflict A is characterized as an X conflict than follow path Z to recovery.  Fair enough, and it has worked in several instances.  In Liberia (prototypical charasmatic leader led conflict), once Charles Taylor left then the conflict subsided almost instantaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difficulty for conflict academics and practitioners (and no I didn’t mistype that) when it comes to Somalia is that every category for conflict can be found.  Not only can every one be found, but the primacy of each driver of conflict into primary, secondary, tertiary, etc.  driver of the conflict will depend on the time and location in which one analyzes the conflict.  The drivers are like a kaleidoscope which is constantly fluctuating over time in each location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a post-modern hell for people who study these things – which answers my own question about the lack of detailed academic research on Somalia (that and the difficulty in getting correct information).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After living here for two years and studying and thinking through the conflict at length (because there is little else to do during a Somalia evening), and despite the kaleidoscopic nature of the conflict, a few themes can be extracted.  The first of which is that in the far south around the major rivers the conflict is really and truly about natural resources and land.  Which is why my organization has put in to do a project focused on conflict mitigation of natural resources driven low-level conflicts throughout Somalia – but particularly in that region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other major theme, and how this connects with the WFP report, is that the business community in Mogadishu is quite happy with the anarchical situation.  Let me explain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If Somalis were Americans a large percentage of them would be mid-nineties salesmen.  The ones that would drive the 2.0 Trans Am, sport their cell phones in belt holsters, and have lunch meetings at Hooters.  They are quite money focused (certainly more than many from West Africa), and this has some good consequences.  Here in the north the private sector is very vibrant and is driving much of the development; there remains a good environment for doing business – certainly better than the neighbors in the region.  However, the focus on money can make many a bit myopic as they are always chasing pennies and don’t see the dollars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have met businessmen from the south who laugh at their colleagues here in the north who &lt;em>only&lt;/em> make 67% profit (I’m referencing the telecom sector here) as opposed to in the south where they make double that. There are tons of instances in the history of the southern conflict where it has been oscillating towards some resolution but the business community ensures that instability returns quickly.  They are convinced that the anarchy allows them to live like kings and do whatever they want – in their minds make more money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet from my point of view they are looking at the wrong metric.  I think they should be looking at the total amount of profit.  Sure they can make a higher percentage in Mogadishu than the guys can here in H-town, but the pot is bigger here so in the end they make more money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where the dissonance approaches resonance frequency for me.  The  rhetoric has failed to show these men that peace will inevitably make them richer.  Although their profit margins will fall, their total  revenue will rise at a faster rate and they will end up with more money in their pockets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simple talking has failed to convince them of such a result, so here is where I’m optimistic about the WFP report.  If the pirates can (ironically) be the ones that raise the costs for the large importers then the effects of that rise in the cost of business will ripple throughout and maybe the arguments for resolution of the conflict will gain more weight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or maybe the businessmen will simply launch their own navies as they already have their own armies. I don’t know, but I remain optimistic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Like this guy, I’ve been up in the clouds lately.  Luckily our soy is beginning to fabricate.  Things are really coming along with all of my various bits and bobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one hand it has passed the time quickly in between when I saw Leigh last and when I will see her again (a week from tonight).  Yet, on the other hand, there’s been some disjunctiveness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The source of so much of my inefficiency as a bad computing environment – top to bottom.  My laptop is getting old and now is a portable desktop which often shuts down whenever I’m least ready.  My internet for the past month has been virtually non-existent, and when the “virtually” modifier was operative, it wasn’t – at least steadily.  Further, I’ve been digging a bit deeper into my own technology usage in preparation for the &lt;a href="http://watershedplatforms.com">Watershed Platforms&lt;/a> launch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I’m wont to do, I have gone a bit overboard in some areas.  I always spread my net quite wide when I’m trying new things as I like to hone it down after being presented with the full buffet.  After I understand things and start to form opinions then I pare it down.  Music, blogs, whatever.  The only problem is that it takes a bunch of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now my feet seem to be a bit under me.  I’ve transferred my own stuff over, first to an absolutely awful hosting company which frustrated the hell out of me, but now to a new one.  Problematically, I accidentally deleted the entire wordpress database in the process and so had to rebuild everything from scratch – so it basically took twice as long.  In any event, now expect regular dispatches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The wind is up and I’m pretty much ready.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This could be frighteningly powerful force.  The question really is whether it will be used for good or for nefarious ends.  The most likely answer is both.  So then the question becomes a matter of filtering and turning up the volume on those voices which are speaking truth.  As technology continues to improve and the filtering/volume tools become more accessible and well-known then we could be on the brink of a revolution of mindsets across the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We saw a fundamental change in the way politics was conducted in the last US election.  iPhones mainstreamed social networking by putting the networks in our pockets which gave us continued access to them.  This brought the technology into real life and closed the gap between what I see on my computer screen and what I do or think in real life.  I continue to be amazed at what can be achieved and am extraordinarily optimistic about the coming decade and Africa’s ability to join the rest of the world who are innovating and progressing at stable but tangible rates.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/worldchanging_fulltext/~3/raJq_tNDaA0/010976.html">The first&lt;/a> to be published was from &lt;a href="http://twit.com/alexsteffen">Alex Steffen&lt;/a>.  Money Quotes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Gates spoke about his commitment to using his massive philanthropic resources&lt;br>
(the Gates Foundation is the world's largest) to make life better for people&lt;br>
through public health and poverty alleviation (&amp;ldquo;vaccines and seeds&amp;rdquo; as he put&lt;br>
it). Then he said something he's never said before: that is it &lt;em>because&lt;/em>&lt;br>
he's committed to improving life for the world's vulnerable people that he now&lt;br>
believes that climate change is the most important challenge on the planet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even more importantly, he acknowledged the only sensible goal, when it comes&lt;br>
to climate emissions, is to eliminate them: we should be aiming for a&lt;br>
civilization that produces no net emissions, and we should be aiming to live in&lt;br>
that civilization here in the developed world by 2050. . .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do that, we need an &amp;ldquo;energy miracle.&amp;rdquo; We need energy solutions that don't&lt;br>
yet exist, released through a global push for clean energy innovation. That, in&lt;br>
turn, demands that a generation of entrepreneurs push forward new ideas for&lt;br>
renewable energy, unleashing &amp;ldquo;1,000 promising ideas.&amp;rdquo; He described one of his&lt;br>
own investments, but went on to note that we need hundreds of other ambitious&lt;br>
companies as well, and he plans to put his own efforts into this arena.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why is this important? The news stories focused largely on the clean energy&lt;br>
aspect of the speech, and certainly the world's most successful businessman&lt;br>
announcing that clean energy is the next frontier is a big headline. However, I&lt;br>
think though that the real breakthrough was not Gates&amp;rsquo; answer to the problem,&lt;br>
but his definition of success: zero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bright green advocates understand that we need &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010070.html">prosperity without&lt;br>
planetary impact&lt;/a>. In many of the circles I run in, this is an&lt;br>
uncontroversial idea, and, indeed, the conversation has moved on, to discussing&lt;br>
how we decouple better lives from &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006650.html">ecological&lt;br>
footprints&lt;/a> (or even go beyond, and build a society that &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/004509.html">restores the ecosystems&lt;br>
on which it depends&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To say, however, that the standard of zero impact is not widely understood&lt;br>
and endorsed would be a whopping understatement. Most people rarely see the&lt;br>
things they do, buy and use as directly part of the living systems of the&lt;br>
planet. Few people who do think of their connection to nature have ever&lt;br>
conceived their lives designed to have no impact at all. For most people, a ten&lt;br>
percent or twenty percent improvement sounds like a big deal — in large part&lt;br>
because the improvements they're most familiar with involve giving things up.&lt;br>
When they do encounter it, the idea of &amp;ldquo;zero&amp;rdquo; looms like a giant wall of&lt;br>
deprivation in front of them. The idea that zero might not be the end of the&lt;br>
good life, but in fact the beginning of a much better way of life, is simply&lt;br>
inconceivable to the vast, vast majority of them. When we talk zero, we sound&lt;br>
crazy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But when Bill Gates talks zero, he sounds visionary. Gates, whatever else he&lt;br>
did Friday, just made the most important idea on the planet mainstream credible.&lt;br>
That's a big, big deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This was all well and good and at this point in the article I was thinking, yeah, so what.  None of this is new and we have litigated it and people with my belief system about the world seem to be largely losing at every corner (e.g., see Obama @ Copenhagen).  At the end of the article Steffen wrote something that truly resonated with me and largely fits squarely within my own unique world-view.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The energy intensity of any given form of prosperity can, I believe, be improved&lt;br>
quite a bit; but the idea that E can be dramatically improved without improving&lt;br>
the kind of prosperity we're attempting to provide is the very definition of&lt;br>
what I call &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010947.html">The&lt;br>
Swap&lt;/a>. The Swap doesn't work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we don't need it to. The idea that contemporary suburban American&lt;br>
lifestyles (the kind of prosperity most people around the world aspire to,&lt;br>
thanks to Hollywood and advertising), the idea that McMansions, SUVs and fast&lt;br>
food chicken wraps somehow represent the best form of prosperity we could&lt;br>
possibly invent is, of course, obviously ludicrous.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can reinvent what prosperity means and how it works, and, in the process&lt;br>
both reduce the ecological demands of that prosperity and improve the quality of&lt;br>
our lives. In most cases, this is a smarter approach than simply improving&lt;br>
efficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to the problem of cars and automotive emissions, for instance, &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007800.html">isn't designing a&lt;br>
better car, it's designing a better city&lt;/a>. The answer to the problem of&lt;br>
overconsumption isn't recycling cans or green shopping, it's changing our&lt;br>
relationship to stuff, so that everything we use and live with is designed for&lt;br>
&lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/008176.html">zero waste&lt;/a>, and&lt;br>
either meant to last (&amp;ldquo;heirloom design&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;durability&amp;rdquo;) or to be shared&lt;br>
(&amp;ldquo;product service systems&amp;rdquo;) or both. The best living we've ever had is waiting&lt;br>
beyond zero. What looks like a wall to many people from this side of zero, looks&lt;br>
to like a trellis from the other side, a foundation on which &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/006915.html">new thinking&lt;/a> can&lt;br>
flourish.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cities are the tools we need for reinventing prosperity. &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/010941.html">We can build&lt;br>
zero-impact cities&lt;/a>, and we need to. Any answer to the problem of climate&lt;br>
change needs to be as focused on reinventing the future as powering it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This, I must say, is one of the biggest things I've learned while living in Africa.  Here I understand *exactly *where my water comes from.  I've gone to see the system of wells and the water pipes which run them the 30 km or so here to H'town.  I've seen the power generation plants for the city and talked with their engineers.  I know exactly where my food and the things I see in the market come from (all I had to do was walk around lower Dubai for 20 minutes).  I know exactly where my trash ends up (burned or lying outside my gate in a pile. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Africa has taught me in a way that being Green in America never could, that all the crap that is around.  That crap comes from somewhere and it goes somewhere.  Sure, I've seen huge dumps in America as I've driven around.  But those don't have anywhere near the impact on my personal consumption as does seeing a burnt can of probably beans that I ate twelve months ago sitting in a pile outside my compound which I have to drive past every day.  That did, in fact, make a huge impact on my personal consumption.  Not necessarily driving me to deprivation, but driving me to seek more authenticity in my actions – grow your own vegetables, build things for yourself. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I see the value in the flaws of the things around me which I've built and despite their flaws (or maybe because of them) I value these things more.  Sure, maybe my tomatoes are small, but I grew them in a way that not only helped out the longevity of the soil they were grown in but also in a way which positively affected those within my community.  For every one tomato I eat, my staff eat ten or twenty.  Instead of buying so much meat and rice they have all expanded their diets due to the ease and proximity of our garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another massive thing which Africa has taught me is that really to change behavior you have to change the incentive structure.  And this is where I think Steffen gets it correct.  Because for whatever reason of utility America and by extension the world value suburbia, McMansions and whatever else he said.  When I was small I remember those being my metrics for success.  When I was in college I remember telling people that those were the types of things that I wanted. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, I have realized that now I don't necessarily want those things.  What I do want is authenticity and to be in harmony with the community and ecosystem around me.  The one thing I will say, and the biggest problem I have with suburbia is this notion of authenticity.  It just predominately lacks soul, &lt;em>and a bit of stank&lt;/em>.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I've realized how I changed my own behavior I have tried my best to extend that into my day job by always trying to change the behavior patterns of politicians by helping them to realign their own incentive structures.  More on that for another day.  Suffice it to say for now, but I am not shy about stating that fact.  At its core governance work in the developing world boils down to an intellectual conflict between the way the developed world thinks about its citizens and how the developing world thinks about its citizens.  I'm speaking broadly here and of course there are contrarian anecdotes, but in any event that is how I see things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/worldchanging_fulltext/~3/lmi5w0ft-Qc/010978.html">second article&lt;/a> was more mainstream green thinking.  I didn't see to much in it that resonated with me personally.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Everyone Funding Startups!!! &lt;a href="http://www.growvc.com/main/index.html">Grow VC&lt;/a>&lt;br>
is the first global crowdfunding tool for web and mobile startups.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a fantastic idea, which compliments so nicely with Kiva.  My only critique is that it is very tech focused.  Although it makes a&lt;br>
logical entry point for oversight reasons (primarily), I hope that they&lt;br>
will open it up to other sectors.  Everyday I meet business people&lt;br>
here in Africa with fantastic ideas.  The capital flight from Africa has&lt;br>
created a situation where they cannot get access to mid-level funding. &lt;br>
Grow VC fills a very important gap in the finance world and I wish&lt;br>
them nothing but success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the notion of capital flight, this is a major problem.  I heard a&lt;br>
story recently about a high-level East African politician who had&lt;br>
acquired a large sum of money but was having trouble getting the French&lt;br>
banks to accept it.  Number one comment: good for the French banks.  But&lt;br>
number two: if the African elites continue to put their money in developed&lt;br>
world banks, their SMEs are going to continue to lack access to&lt;br>
capital.  If they could decide to bring some of that money back and then&lt;br>
the banks in their own countries could leverage that money via lending&lt;br>
to SMEs Africa would develop a lot faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Honestly, development has a place but all the weeping for the world&lt;br>
is tiring.  Let us stop whining and act.  Grow VC has done just that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our new roommate was telling us this story about Lockerbee.  Steve, the new roommate, is a terribly interesting man to talk to.  In fact, it would be daunting talking to him if he wasn't such a genuine and normal human.  We see eye to eye on many of the problems around us and he is doing something quite remarkable.  He came here to S'land a few years ago and is now starting a dive business!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The synopsis of the story is that the US DIA and DEA were involved in this smuggling chain of drugs from Afghanistan through Iran and Syria and eventually to Europe.  Most of the drugs at that time were routed through Cyprus.  According to the story, the US wasn't actually smuggling things, but in return for CIA hostages in Lebanon being looked after by the criminal syndicates the syndicates were allowed to bring a certain amount of drugs into Europe.  The rest were confiscated by the DEA and the smugglers were paid for the drugs taken by the DEA.  Good usage of your tax dollars? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway after the Vicente shot down the Iranian airliner the Iranians got noticeably and reasonably upset and told Syria who told Hezbollah to smuggle a bomb onto the Pan-Am flight in retaliation.  The CIA somehow knew about this, as all their people who were leaving Frankfurt to come home for Christmas that year had previously been booked on the flight but then changed the day before to a TWA flight.  After the plane came down the Scottish policemen who were on scene were told to leave and go beyond some line while MI6 and the CIA took all the documents and papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At this point in the story it sounded just like a good spy novel, but then the guy who was DIA in Cypress and knew about the deal blew the whistle and was charged with treason.  Subsequently he fled to Sweden and got asylum.  The book he wrote was banned in the UK and the US.  No matter whether it is true, false or some combination, I'm going to read it.  Thanks to the internet, it can be found &lt;a href="http://www.american-buddha.com/trail.ch.1.htm">here&lt;/a> if you are interested.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">http://www.apple.com/itunes/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no idea how the algorithm works, but it does just work.  As usual with Apple products, the first few times I used it I was distinctly underwhelmed.  But then I came back to it a few months later and I was amazed. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>From what I can tell, it seems to take into account both subjective and objective criteria.  This is key, because I am very anal about how I log, listen, and classify my music collection.  Thanks mom, for that wonderful personality quirk.  I have no idea if the objective criteria are pulled from the iTunes database, crowdsourcing,&lt;br>
or some combination. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet for whatever reason genius seems to take this into account.  Very little of my music currently has the genre which came when I bought the songs from iTunes.  I have reconfigured everything, and this gets taken into account (from what I can tell) when Genius makes its track decisions.  The other subjective criteria it seems to take into account besides the genres are the ratings, which I’m overly fastidious in using. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, it also takes into account some level of objective criteria.  Sometimes if I put on an older track I have the pleasure of many of my old high school favorite tracks.  So it must take into account the year of the album.  Also when I put on a woman singer, most of the tracks selected are women.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Last][3]][3] The last thing, and that which I most appreciate, is that it does a great job of keeping with the overall mood which I’m going for.  If I find one song that fits my particular mood of  the moment – Genius is really good about keeping me in that mood while exploring my music collection in the way that [last.fm][3] allows me to do with an online portfolio outside my music collection.  Last.fm is fantastic, but my bandwidth limitations usually preclude using it.  Sometimes everything is OK, but usually the music is sketchy which is incredibly annoying.  Kudos to Last, by the way, for opening up their interface.  When I first came to Africa I could not listen to my tracks / stations, but now they have fixed that.  Thanks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/">http://www.last.fm/&lt;/a>

&lt;p>[![Apple_tv_intro_graphic][5]][5] Generally, I hate listening to my music on my tinny computer speakers.  Luckily, a while ago when I was up in Europe I bought an [AppleTV][5].  This is fantastic for me, because I can plug it into my decent receiver and speakers.  The closed nature of AppleTV is annoying, but there are plenty of hacks.  Yet, even out of the box when combined with Genius it is wonderful.  You get Apple’s stunning, sexy graphic interfaces and your music which can be played on reasonable speakers.  This is a blissful combination for me.  The final thing which I will say is that I use Genius similarly to how I use the web, I wander.  I will find old favorites or new favorites and Genius them to see what else I may be forgetting or never have found within my own music collection.  Genius.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[This ][2]is an interest article exploring BOP business models within the US. This is good to hear as usually these models are seen to be only a phenomenon of the developing world, but I haven't been seeing why they would not be equally applicable and useful for poverty reduction in the developed world.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[This][3] is the other article which speaks about micro-lending in the US.  This is another trend which has been used throughout many, many countries in the developing world with a huge success rate.  [Grameen][4] basically invented it, but [Kiva ][5]made it famous.  I am pleased to see that at least one company is taking up the challenge of applying it to the US.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1204/1224260043076.html">http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1204/1224260043076.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last December a bomb exploded in Mogadishu.  Actually, it was the 4th of December. I didn’t remember the date until I looked it up just &lt;a href="http://http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/1204/1224260043076.html">now&lt;/a>.  Pictures like the one at the left pretty much fit most people’s world view of Somalia.  Yet, I live here and I have a completely different view of the situation. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I left my house on the day in question about about 2 or so in the afternoon.   I walked out of the gigantic green gate which is the entrance to our compound via the embedded regular sized door and stopped for a few moments to chat with my body guards who would be walking with me the 200 m or so to my friend’s house. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>As one left to go grab a jacket and something to drink, another of them and I were chatting in Somalglish.  He told me that there had been a bomb that day in Mogadishu.  I didn’t think that much about it as bombs are always going off in Mogadishu.  I replied, “OK.”  If I got too worked up every time I heard that someone had died violently, or that a militia was now mobilizing, or that this area or that area was on the verge of complete and utter dissolution then I would have gone insane long ago. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moments after the guard who would be accompanying me returned and we headed off to my friends.  I have no idea what I may have been pondering during the time, but it surely was brilliant and had nothing to do with the bomb. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I arrived at my friend’s house everyone was particularly chatty that day.  I took my assigned seat in the circle which all eight or so of us occupy with regularity.  We sit on the floor due to a legend that if you chew qat while sitting on cushions you’ll get indigestion.  No one was that worked up, but the radio had not yet come on and the power in my friend’s house doesn’t turn on until 4 pm or so. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that it was about 3 when VOA Somali is aired.  My friend Maal loves his little radio and he loves the VOA – which has only been operating for the past six months or so.  Prior to that everyone received their news via BBC Somali’s radio service.  When VOA came in, for whatever reason, they tromped BBC – which swelled my national pride at the expense of my wife’s. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, VOA came on and everyone listened with horror to the headline.  There had been a suicide bomb at a medical school graduation in Mogadishu that day.  Slowly the information came out.  And then the power came on and we instantly turned on al Jazeera.  The pictures were horrible.  As the afternoon wore on I grew angrier and angrier by the moment. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the one had there was the human tragedy part of the story.  The kids that were graduating had known war their *entire *lives.  Most likely they had heard gun shots almost everyday that they’ve been born.  They had likely been subjected to the sounds of mortars at least once a month going into the depths of their memories. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>They had been subjected to social pressures unimaginable to me. Sure, we all have to deal with peer pressure, but many of the peers of these kids were beyond violent gangsters long, long ago.  They had rejected the pressure to take up a gun – and they had found a way to stay in school.  Likely they did not always finish their homework as when it got dark, it got *dark.  *They probably did not have working generators for significant portions of their childhoods – making studying after sunset next to impossible unless you can catch some cars driving by (but this is Mogadishu and there aren’t that many of them).  The list goes on and on, and kids all over Africa have gone through these horrors which make our childhood complaints so minuscule.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yet, these kids had rejected the easy route that so many of those their age had taken on.  Indeed, they had not only rejected the route of violence, they had taken a decided opposite route.  I make this joke about how after graduating undergraduate with an engineering degree I decided to become a Marine and blow things up instead of building them.  These kids made the correct choice, which is the opposite of mine.  They decided to put *people *back together instead of blowing people up.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let us not look at this with rose colored glasses and think that, well, they had made a financial decision.  Doctors in south-central Somalia are like teachers in the US, well-respected but under-compensated. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this day, this day was a chance to celebrate.  A chance to turn their finely tuned sense of danger off.  A chance to relax their tension for a small time.  A chance for their parents who equally sacrificed throughout to engage in the age old parental paradigm: to be proud of their offspring.  A chance for redemption, that they had beaten all the forces which have colluded against their academic success. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then…. B    O    O     M.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no way to imagine.  Now, almost two months after the event my heart still breaks when I try to imagine the scene. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>That day, here with my friends, almost all eight of us were brought to tears.  The rest of them are all older Somali men.  And not prone to over-sensitivity. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I oscillated.  My emotions swung from extreme horror and sadness about the actual explosion to anger because of what had cause the explosion.  Back and forth through the afternoon.  Back and forth as the information came out.  Back and forth as the videos were shown on al Jazeera.  Back and forth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The anger stemmed from the realization that this is a new phenomenon in Somalia.  See, Mogadishu has been an utter mess for well over twenty years.  However, it has been a mess that has been (by all Somali accounts) largely navigable.  Things were oddly predictable if you understood the situation well.  The Somali conflict has been (prior to the most recent couple of years) largely distinct from other African conflicts.  Civilian casualties have been quite low.  Rape, mass slaughter, amputations, rampant drug use, cannibalism, all of the horror that sells newspapers and funds NGOs has largely been absent from the Somali conflict.  I do not try to minimize the trials of those in Mogadishu, I’m simply saying that vis a vis Sierra Leone for instance things are very different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those that have lived in Mogadishu have been able to more or less live, despite the limitations. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, things have been changing rapidly in south-central Somalia.  The “invasion” by the Ethiopians did not spawn it.  In fact, that was quite conventional warfare mixed with a conventional insurgency.  It was after the Ethiopians withdrew when Mogadishu experienced its first suicide bomb.  If I remember correctly it was a vehicle-borne IED detonated in front of an AMISOM compound – no one was hurt. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few months later, in October 2008 three coordinated suicide bombs went off here in the capital of the north.  It was a dark day, and a pivotal day.  In more ways than the devastation, it was Somalia’s 9/11.  By that I mean it was a watershed event and marks a disjunctive point in time where everything before and everything after must be interpreted in very different ways. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Admittedly the frequency of suicide attacks and other advanced insurgent tactics based upon the violence against civilians is much lower in Mogadishu than in Afghanistan or Iraq.  And, yet, the frequency is steadily increasing.  Here in the north, in the town that marks the boundary between the north-eastern and northern sections of what the world knows as Somalia has been a mess for the past few weeks. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A suicide bomber strapped himself up, and gave his friend the remote detonator.  He intended to walk into the hotel where some Ministers and other officials were staying and have his friend detonate him.  This tactic was largely developed by the Palestinians to ensure that the human delivering the explosive did not get cold feet about the situation.  However, and for whatever reason, the friend pushed the remote detonator when the strapped friend was 200 m or so from the hotel.  No one was hurt, except for the strapped friend.  The legs of that man are intact, but the rest was decimated. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This all represents the genesis of my anger on that day last December.  For years and years, Somali society like the kids who stayed in school, have resisted the more awful aspects of war.  Yes all war is terrible, but in my mind there are degrees.  And suicide bombings is about the lowest one can get tactically.  For whatever reason, Somali society has not been able to hold back the tendency to engage in these tactics.  Maybe it is foreign fighters coming in.  Maybe AQ is there in the south and training fighters.  Maybe it is copycat-ism. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have no idea, but it makes me angry.  Because the only result of this situation is that more people.  Real people.  People that do not deserve to die.  Will die. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>No many people who grew up on my circumstances of life – middle-class in the developed world – understand what it feels like to have a country you love invaded.  But there, on that floor, on that day I began to understand what the Iraqis may have felt when a friend of mine hoisted an American flag over Saddam’s face. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>What struck me the most, besides the anger and the sadness, was the utter feeling of hopelessness.  Long ago I put down a gun and picked up books.  I decided that my brain and my words were the weapons that I personally wielded the best.  Part of me, on that particular day, regretted that decision.  Because I just wanted to &lt;em>do something&lt;/em>.  And yet, what can words or logic or reason achieve?  That is the question.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p>All I do know is that I have to continue to hope and to try.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is how  BT introduces the video:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Ted Kennedy was a model American politician: he rose from a famous&lt;br>
family, had significant personal wealth and connections, endured&lt;br>
scandals, and was a shrewd political operator. But what set Kennedy&lt;br>
apart from his peers was the authentic and uncompromising moral drive&lt;br>
that he brought to the Senate. He understood and used his advantages to&lt;br>
successfully push America in a better direction. In one of his last&lt;br>
interviews, Kennedy reflected with Big Think on his career, his family,&lt;br>
and his faith.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I must admit that I do not have terribly strong opinions either way on Teddy.  I heartily endorse, in principle, those values and goals which he fought for over all of the years.  However his personal scandals preclude me from full-scale fandom.  Yet, I really appreciate what he says in this video about citizen participation.  It is the key to forward progress.  And even though I think that the Tea Partiers are quite off key policy wise, I do endorse their collective action and their ability to leverage that to achieve their goals.  I also appreciate what BT says in their introduction, that Teddy used whatever influence and advantages that he was given and that he produced to try his best to work for those around them.  And he did keep doing that until the end of his life.  And so, I big you a late adieu lion of the senate.  May you rest in peace.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The other thing which troubles me is that they seem to assume that just because Shabaab has announced that they are al Qaeda, that means that they are.  While the specifics of this are less than opaque, the evidence they point to is rather dismal.  There is a lot of counter-evidence that Shabaab is largely peopled by Islamist wannabes.  Personally, I lean toward the latter.  I think that largely Shabaab is a rebranded insurgency with Islamist claims in order to secure financing.  Yet, it is complex, as there are solid reports that some of the leadership of Shabaab has been trained by AQ and retains its linkages.  This leads me to believe that there is a split within the organization, but more on that at a latter date. &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is big news for anyone still trying to read the tea leaves on the Somali insurgency, not least becuase in all honesty, this is really no insurgency at all. It's a parallel government. On any day of the week, it would be easy to point to a map and argue that more of Somalia's territory is run by Shabaab and its allies control than by the Transitional Federal Government (despite rather &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/01/30/world/AP-AF-Somalia.html">optimistic claims&lt;/a> to the contrary). So if Shabaab is the al Qaeda affiliate it claims to be, that means that Somalia is being de facto run by a terrorist group. Yikes.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The paragraph below I heartily endorse and agree with from what little I’ve seen.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I have to wonder if the United States really gets all of this. As the last decade of conflict has shown us, chaos — a category in which Somalia has no competitors –  is perhaps the best predictor of 21st Century security ills. And from civil conflict to terrorism to refugees and the plight of disease, Somalia has it all. But it's precisely for that reason that the Somalia portfolio has been a hot potato within the U.S. government — bouncing from agency to agency and advisor to advisor with no clear owner or no clear line. It's probably less that U.S. policymarkers are &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60U18B20100131">ignoring Somalia&lt;/a> (as the African Union suggested this weekend) as they are overwhelmed. A fair excuse, but a dangerous one as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The second article is &lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/02/03/are_the_pirates_linked_to_the_islamists">here&lt;/a>.  This, I think, is even lazier reporting. &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Somalia has two big scourges these days: Islamist milititas the run most of the country (and are &lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/02/01/somali_insurgents_announce_their_allegiance_to_al_qaeda">linked to al Qaeda&lt;/a>) and piracy off the coast. (The combination yields a desperate humanitarian situation sandwiched in between.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what if the two scourges are linked? That was the  suggestion of the Kenyan Vice President Kalonzo Stephen Musyok, speaking at the &lt;a href="http://www.newamerica.net/events/2010/kenyan_somali_border">New America Foundation&lt;/a> today. &amp;ldquo;Piracy is another issue which I think has a  direct link with these extremist militant groups,&amp;rdquo; he told the audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's an odd idea at first. Al Shabaab has built its image on the harsh brand of Sharia that they hope to impose, and during the Islamic Courts government earlier this decade (of which al Shabaab was a part, piracy was banned. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not anymore. Last December, a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=2295946">Canadian intelligence report&lt;/a> indicated that Shabaab was in fact training pirates for their &amp;ldquo;duties.&amp;rdquo; Further reporting from &lt;em>Jane's&lt;/em> (&lt;a href="http://centralasiaonline.com/cocoon/caii/xhtml/en_GB/features/caii/features/2009/04/16/feature-03">summarized here&lt;/a>) notes how taxes are levied on the pirates&amp;rsquo; booties. Yes, the pirates and the Islamists are definitely in cahoots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One way they know that both are getting worse? &amp;ldquo;[I]n Nairobi today, property prices today are still rising, and we think this has a direct link with the piracy.&amp;rdquo; In other words, all those wealthy pirates are &lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/01/04/somali_pirates_driving_up_kenyan_real_estate_prices">buying up fancy homes&lt;/a>. And they've got a lot of cash to spend.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>While I cannot disagree with the quotes, the real evidence that I see exists on a map.  The major pirate networks are not in the south, which is where Shabaab is.  They are in Puntland, which has seen Shabaab incursions recently, but nowhere near to the level that I see this linkage blossom.  I do agree with Dickenson’s analysis that this is something to watch closely.  However, the evidence that pirates are buying houses and driving up property prices in Nairobi (in Isley neighborhood specifically) shows me nothing other than they have nothing else they can buy in Puntland.  Sure there are a few pirate networks that have developed in the South, but these pale in comparison to the networks which are operating with impunity up north.  Perhaps the cited Canadian intel report is correct, but that barely proves the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This illustrates one of my major beefs with living and being here.  The analysis is so shotty.  On the one hand, there are complex issues here, and Somali society isn’t the easiest to figure out.  Yet it isn’t the most complex society to figure out, and when you have a handle on it, it is relatively easy to work out what is happening. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So maybe I need to do more commenting, with the hopes that it may be able to change some of the rhetoric and analysis a small bit.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In that vein, let me tell you of our next few days.  Our roommates (there are a total of five of us, which will constrict to three within a matter of weeks) and Leigh and I will be heading off to “train” the Coast Guard.  Actually, we won’t be doing any training, but Scuba Steve will be training the Coast Guard on boat handling techniques (for their one cutter) and diving techniques (still unsure re: this one). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A while ago we bought a Pirate flag as a joke when we were in Scotland.  I am hoping to fly this from the cutter as we are zooming along.  There is this corner, near Djib, of S-land that Leigh and I have always wanted to visit.  It is apparently one of the most beautiful parts of this country.  There are two major islands off the coast, where Muslim missionaries first crossed from the peninsula into Africa.  There is an ancient ruin of the mosque they used on the one island where we are hoping to camp.  Also there will likely be sea turtles and whale sharks, and some of the best reef diving in the world.  As my roommates are similiar to my family – which is to say nuts about photos – I’m sure there will be numerous photos for posting afterwards. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are hoping that the cruise will contain a short diversion up to Djib where we can acquire wines and other select items not available in our locale.  The S-land Coast Guard are having some sort of a meet and greet with the Djib Navy, so that should be interesting to be a part of. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The pirates shouldn’t be too much of a concern.  I will be posting myself with binos on the bow gatling for much of the trip, or at least for a few photos.  Plus the closer to Djib, where the anti-piracy fleet is “stationed,” one gets the safer one becomes. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should be completely out of contact from Thursday until Monday.  After that, inshallah, there will be tons of stories of nuts adventures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are hoping to see T-Pain somewhere along the way….&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I woke up to homemade chocolate cake (which L could get all ingredients of locally), a bottle of prosecco (imported on the sly from Dubai) and one of those happy birthday stringers (imported openly from Nairobi).  This was served on a tray which we mostly use to take our 24-hour security detail tea in late in the evenings sitting on a low stool I mainly use as an otomon (made from raw camel leather tied to unfinished wood). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>My staff came in early to wish me happy birthday, but also to continue our two day marathon security planning for possible al-qaeda attacks which will be targeted against….well, we're not quite sure who is the target or whether they are even possible to attack anything.  But nevertheless, we are forced to plan for it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>A some point in the day, I have been offered a massage.  The offeror's hands had, five mintues before the offer, been hydro-peroxide-and-q-tiping a cat's ass.  Literally. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This evening we will attend a BBQ which will likely be of a local goat or lamb variety.  There will be other food there – mostly imported from Dubai where all of our delicies arrive from.  The drinks will be supported by many attendees (booze potlucks being the operative social norm), as well as a couple of cases of bad beer (which L likes) imported in Land Cruisers driving over dirt roads from neighboring Ethiopia.  There will be music which will be from someone's iPod amplified by whosever computer speakers are closest. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The four of us in my house (L and I and our roomates – a Swedish former-rugby-player, current-governance-sector-ngo-worker and his American wife current-schoolteacher) will drive 30 minutes to the other side of town dodging, goats, random children who don't look both ways, potholes the size of Orlando, al-Qeada operatives, chickens, donkeys pulling the only source of water for many, men sitting quietly together in open-air teashops listening to BBC, and likely a few crazy homeless people. The Swede, who will likely be driving (a consequence of my prepartying which will result in the violation of above stated social norm) will squint and be blinded multiple times due to the unlit roads throughout town.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tomorrow we will arise late as it is my one day a week off.  All in all, one of my favorites.&lt;/p>

From those of us who no longer live at home.  Thank you for allowing us to proudly hold our heads high in foreign lands again.  Thank you for reminding the entire world why they admire us.  Thank you for making the world remember why we are the great shining beacon of hope in a foul, foul world.  Thank you for the sheer emotion that has flowed freely from your voices, and your faces, and your hearts.  We have felt it from here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From those of us that believe strongly in the power of collective voices exercised through the democratic process.  Thank you for reminding yourselves of the power of people.  Thank you for being patient.  Thank you for being respectful, at least at the end.  Thank you for being gracious both in success and in defeat.  Thank you for uniting in a way that Oprah and Jessie Jackson were&lt;br>
simple spectators to history just like Jonathon Lewis and Ahmed&lt;br>
Ismail.  Thank you for reminding everyone who has fought for their right to vote of the value of that fight.  We are stronger for the process, not necessarily for the winner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And from me personally.  Thank you for engaging.  Thank you for debating, sometimes&lt;br>
collaboratively and sometimes combatitively.  Thank you for hoping.  Thank you for fearing.  Thank you for dreaming.  Thank you for dreading.  Thank you for talking. &lt;br>
Thank you for sharing.  Thank you for txting, and emailing, and facebooking, and&lt;br>
IMing, and calling, and mySpacing, and walking, and knocking.  Thank you&lt;br>
for engaging.  Thank you for not being complacent this time. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take this moment America. 
Revel in the historionics; revel in the hysterionics; revel in your personal victory; revel in your personal defeat.  Because tomorrow we get to work.  All of us must get to work. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Progress only occurs collectively.  For those supporting the majority,&lt;br>
you must ensure accountability for the policies or modes of interaction&lt;br>
you value.  For those supporting the opposition, you must ensure&lt;br>
accountability for the policies or modes of interaction you value. &lt;br>
Conversations cannot become one sided any more.  No party or creed or ideology&lt;br>
maintains a monopoly on the path to our more perfect union.  Collectively, all voices,&lt;br>
are what can continue to perfect our union.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you have believed, what you have discussed, what you have debated, do not lose these things.  Your voice works every day of every year.  Not only on a November Tuesday every other year.  Continue to fight, continue to work, continue to engage, continue to think.  Democracies are driven by the breadth &amp;amp; depth of the voices contained within.  Do not lose yours.  It has inherent value.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And that was really similar to how I felt about politics for a long time.  For much of the time where I would have a say in who became Water Commissioner I spent more time thinking than acting.  I found it to be extraordinarily difficult and an extremely long journey to finally settle on what I felt my political philosophy truly was.  Humans being social creatures, cultural conditioning is a difficult thing to avoid and determining what I truly felt in a vacuum was difficult. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was the first election that I entered where I felt a strong notion of myself.  Views on foreign policy, economic policy, constitutionalism, and the role of government now could really be discussed.  I felt empowered that I had finally be able to solidify some modicum of a baseline worldview, while being open for that to change and flex over time and experience.  I had finally reached a point in my development where I was able to understand possible, probably and unlikely consequences of specific policy choices, and where I was able to foresee balances and tensions in ideas and what that would mean to different demographics and spectra of societies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did not vote in the primary.  Still voting in Florida, and being a registered Democrat, it mattered not what I did and so I did not waste my time.  But I had decided, were my voice asked for, who I would have voted for.  I made this decision based upon pure policy alignment.  I was not interested in delivery, or persona, or groundgame.  I was interested in reading.  I screamed at my television more times than my roommate could probably stand for candidates to wonk out, more, more, more.  Like a kid with a new toy, I wanted to hear more of their thinking so that I could dive deeper into the rabbit hole. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>My turn came in the general election.  And it was not easy.  I had prearranged for my absentee ballot to be sent to my father's house.  Surprisingly, I made a last minute trip to Europe in order to get a visa so that I can marry in the UK next year.  After coordinating plane flights, I asked that my ballot be sent to my girlfriend's place in Holland. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was away from the house when the first delivery attempt was made.  On the package slip it said that there was some money due and that the package was 8 kg.  It seemed odd at first, until I thought that my parents had likely stuck in my Xmas presents. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was also away from the house when the second delivery attempt was made.  I was up in Amsterdam getting said visa.  By now I had developed bronchitis and a sinus infection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was at home when the third delivery attempt was made.  This was the day before I was to leave to return to H-town.  But I never heard the door bell.  Finally I went downstairs and saw the damn delivery slip.  After some investigation I realized that the door bell in our house didn't work.  Which is why my girlfriend a couple of days earlier when I was in bed had to rise me on the phone. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I called the number I was stunned.  I had to go across the country.  Literally to get the damn package.  So they said it would be ready for me to pick up at a given time.  So I hopped on for a 45 minute train ride (across the country in Holland is that far), followed by a 20 minute metro ride, a 10 minute tram ride, and a 2 mile walk in the now dark, freezing, coughing, sinuses clogged, abandoned, have-to-piss Rotterdam dockyard.  Finally I was about to give up.  And instead I found a bush.  After being able to think again I walked a little further and saw the stupid brown sign.  After another 45 minutes of hassling with Dutch people, and 50 euros, I had my package so I began the reverse trudge of 2 miles, followed by a 10 minute wait at a tram station which wasn't running because of an accident, followed by another 2 mile walk, followed by a 20 minute metro ride, and a 45 minute train ride back home.  The next morning before I left I filled out the ballot and dropped it off at the American Embassy on my way to Amsterdam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a challenge to vote.  But it wasn't nearly the challenges that others in history have had.  I have fought for, literally, the right to vote.  This was small potatoes.  And here's the kicker.  I would have done it had he been a muslim.  I would have done it had he been William Ayers best friend.  I would have done it had his emblem been a red background with yellow stars.  I would have done it because I believe that he is a transformative figure in two particular related areas.  His ability to discuss complexities and his ability to create an environment of rationed discussion are what I admire most about him.  Sure there is a policy alignment.  Sure there is the style, and look, the voice, the rhetoric.  Sure there is the belief, the hope, the liberal utopian twinge in my heart.  But none of those made my cough my way to the docks.  It was the fact that I value an actual discussion about what matters rather than some idiotic discussion of a washed up terorrist that no one in my generation remembers or cares about.  It was the fact that I value someone who is willing to lay out the tensions and why a specific avenue was chosen rather than some idiotic notion of dissent = unpatriotic.  This is what pushed me over.  This is what I've valued.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is why I voted for Barack Obama.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Instead, I offer for your consumption a slightly different perspective.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I remember being maybe 5 or 6 and either watching this show, or at least the trailer for a show about life after the Soviets invaded America and took over.  It was the type of propoganda that I have to suspect most of those who spent more time in the Cold War than I were constantly subjected to.  Over the years I have read or heard various references either to this show specifically or to the genre generally.  Mostly these have been referenced by pop culture historians and the like.  It all seemed a bit far-fetched to me.  I remember thinking at the time of seeing the show or trailer, how could such a thing actually happen.  The mechanisms for how it happened just did not compute.  After the thought, though, I constructed for days a novel in my head about a young boy who frustrates the Soveit's attempts to actually get a foothold in Orlando.  Essentially I was the young Che in my mind.  I largely constructed this dream world while in a tree behind my Aunt's house who I went to every afternoon following school.  It may seem odd that the failure of the bailout to pass brings up such a memory for me, but trust me it's not as random as it seems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been argued to me that there is enough liquid capital in the US economy to absorb the losses from the failed banks that the bailout was designed to absorb.  Although I have no hard evidence to backup my thinking, I have not been so sure.  It seems to me that the only viable financial institutions will be hoarding cash like a suburban mother buying cans for her bomb shelter during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  OK, I accept that Citi today finalized the deal for Wachovia, but perhaps they needed Wachovia's deposits to bolster their cash and were willing to absorb the liabilities on Wachovia's accounts, which when compared to Citi's must be miniscule.  So it seems to me that it was a short term tactic design to enhance their available cash.  Many of the bundled mortgages and other default credit swap items do not come ready packaged with a large amount of cash, however.  So I am not so sure that there will be an entity within the US economy capable of purchasing those at anything approaching market value. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>In many cases the financial industry would likely reach across the Atlantic.  But no one in Europe is willing to help.  First, they've all been burned by this nearly as bad as we have.  Secondly, they've got their own massive problems now with the Brit's having to broker numerous deals to bolster their banks (for the why, see 1).  Could we eat our pride and reach across the Pacific?  Maybe, Japan has already bought one of the failing banks (or a major piece I cannot remember and am too lazy to find a link). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will have to see what happens.  In my mind China's central bankers will wake up tomorrow and it will be Chinese Christmas for them.  They are likely the only ones that have enough liquid capital to do anything about this.  I have a distinct feeling that American's who didn't want the American government to own their homes may have a distinctly different feeling when they wake up and realize that the only people able to buy our mortgages are the Chinese sovereign wealth fund or one of the few tightly controlled Chinese banks. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real game changer, and why I am wondering whether in fifty years historians will pinpoint this day, is that this demonstrates once and for all the end of the dreams, hopes, fears of any continuation of American hegemony within the international community.  Military prowess?  Lost about the summer of 2005.  Moral authority?  Lost about the same time.  Ability to communicate?  Lost about January 2001.  Economic superiority?  Will it be lost?  I don't know.  But suspect that yes, yes it will.  American greed has driven the world's economy since about the mid-90s.  But what happens when American greed turns into American begging?  Don't know.  I will admit that this reads a bit doomsdayish, but I am not thinking that it will play any other way.  They will all blame us for their inevitable economic slow downs, but they will laugh at ours as it will likely be worse than theirs.  After those corrections the only ones left standing will likely be the Asians who had enough foresight and financial education to save relentlessly and not overextend their lines of credit and are now laughing at the stupid Americans that bought their goods (we and) they couldn't afford for so long.  But now they can afford their own goods.  And soon, we will not be able to.  So that is one observation. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another is reading the Roll Call analysis from the House vote is pretty amazing.  Sure Pelosi gave her speech.  Whatever.  Sure D 60-40 Y; R 33-67 Y.  That isn't what I think is interesting.  The statistic that is more interesting is this one (when combined with the last).  Of those House seats where the incumbent is in a tight race, only 21% voted Y.  Now combine that with the first and you have an imperfect estimate that more Republicans are in tight races than Democrats.  In other words the GOP is in more of a precarious position than I actually thought. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is some fundamental disconnect here that I admittedly do not understand.  As of earlier today the polls showed that only 11% of the public wanted the government to do nothing.  These ultimate free marketeers would reflect my general perception of how much of a percentage those types of people likely occupy in the American polity.  So that number made sense to me.  But what doesn't make sense is how that 11% was able to get what it wanted.  That is not to say the Bill is dead, but it is certainly in a coma on life support as it wasn't a narrow no.  It was a bipartisan, resounding No.  OK, fine.  But if this whole thing was negotiated by the leadership of both parties, what were the whips doing all weekend?  And I have no idea what the way forward is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I skimmed about half of the Bill during my lunch break today.  It seemed, well, not great, but not awful.  Obviously, the most vital part of the Bill is the power for Treasury to pay the principle and interest on the bank's Treasury deposits, which allows the banks to right off those bills for the time being and use their cash on hand for operating expenses.  This is a backhanded way for the Treasury to sink a ton of cash into the system without incurring inflationary pressures that seignurage normally requires.  That was the core of the Bill as far as getting the Banks to resume lending to one another, which is what is needed as far as corporations are concerned.  The other core of the Bill was the purchasing of the assets of institutions nearing failure or already failed.  This is where the government would own your home.  In my mind there were seemingly gigantic problems with that section.  Especially with the valuation as the Treasury was requried to purchase assets, but the valuation of the assets was not established by any sort of mechanism other than what the Treasury was thinking they were worth.  I thought how in hell does Treasury know what they are worth, especially the bundled assets.  The answer is that they do not and really have little ability to find out other than what the seller is asking.  This creates a seller's market.  Perhaps that was the intention.  Give the financial institutions a bit of a windfall, which creates incentives for iBankers not to take themselves and everything they own out of the system and move to their land in Montana to open up a free-range cattle ranch.  Perhaps it was not the intention and one of the re&lt;br>
asons the bill failed.  However, I see no other way to valuate the assets and am not sure what Congress and Paulson could have done. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>My main nervousness with the Bill was that it gave Treasury an insane amount of discretionary space.  Again, I see no other options so Congress was likely caught in a Catch-22 on that one.  The executive already has a massive amount of discretionary authority when it comes to economic policy in this country.  The Bill as drafted would have given the executive even more.  Although this is nice for Bushites who love the unitary executive theory, those of us who have a different philosophical conception of separation of powers may be concerned.  Certainly I was.  And still am.  As I think more and more about it, largely that concern is academic.  One major windfall for me is that the dollar's value is screaming through the roof as everyone clammers for cash-based assets.  This means the place Highlands and I want to buy in Edinburgh is getting cheaper by the Bush screwup.  Thanks buddy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One last thought and then am off to bed.  How will this play on Thursday night?  Am interested to see.  Likely Palin will play the &amp;ldquo;it's people like you in Washington that don't care about the American public&amp;rdquo; card.  He won't, but I wish Biden would play the &amp;ldquo;it's people like the idiots from your small town you love so much that got us into this mess by, like you, not understand a single damn thing about economics or finances&amp;rdquo; card. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still hoping for if anything is passed we get some nice earmarks for mandatory financial literacy at the high school level…..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update: McCain's campaign just called to inform me that earmarks are the anti-Christ and I should not reference them anywhere.  How did they know that I typed that as I haven't posted this yet? &lt;/p>

&lt;p>McCain did well on FP, as was to be expected.  His best answer was on Georgia when he said that this was largely about energy and (didn't say but meant) that this is important to Putin in order to entrench himself.  He shine when talking about Ukraine and the need to stabilize it while hoping to keep it as an ally to counterbalance growing Russian strength.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obama did well on FP, probably better than expectations.  His best answer was on Iran when he spoke about how the invasion of Iraq took away the regional counterbalance and thus strengthened their position in the short term and medium term vis a vis the region. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Iran, they are both going the same way, just from different angles.  They want and need a regional counterbalance to Iranian influence.  Obama says we never should have gone into Iraq, McCain says we needed the surge.  They are both right about one and about the other, but their arguments miss each other because they are taking into account different temporal timeframes which require different consideration.  Obviously both know that, but these are their stump positions. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The economy half was pure stump for both.  No surprises big surprises there.  Except McCain considering a suspension of spending, which if you noticed the second time he hedged from defense, VA and entitlements to defense, VA and critical (or vital, not sure) areas.  I'm not sure how he would classify vital areas any more than how Obama plans to quantify combat troops in his 16 month pledge.  But am not bothered, it is political and not substantive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random other observations.  I have CNN here and they had the red blue green real time reaction.  I never saw green reaction for McCain go about the second line.  And I rarely saw the red go above that line.  A couple of times when he tugged at heart-strings it got close to being above for the red.  The green and the blue were largely tracking each other through most of the debate.  There were divergences when Obama would attack Bush.  But for the most part they were flowing together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that Republicans will identify the number of times Obama pointed to areas of agreeance as a weakness or naivete area of Obama.  I enjoyed them.  Perhaps it is a difference of style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought that McCain's patronizing of Obama was a bit overboard.  Fine one or two times say you don't get it, but nearly every answer that he gave was that way.  Not sure how it will play with voters, but the green line in the hall seemed to be turned off almost every time he said it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was also struck by the shear about of mischaracterizations that McCain made of Obama's record.  I did not hear or do not remember but once or twice McCain have to parse Obama's words to clarify the record and recover from an attack.  I remember many many more times where that was the case. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was struck by McCain's answer on 9/11.  It was an open-ended question.  I heard him in the summer of 2006 give an excellent answer to a similar question where he talked about the root causes of terrorism and how those need to be addressed.  He spoke of poverty in Ramallah as well as how the Saudi system of government needs to be addressed with strength by the President, etc.  Views that are espoused by most main stream foreign policy realists.  Tonight's answer, and what I've heard him say on the trail is very different.  Much more neo-con.  I am not sure if he has gotten handled, there is some political coalition building going on or whether now that he is running for President he can assert some latent self that he could not as a Senator.  Whatever the case, he has seemingly drastically changed from what I perceived to be standard realist notions about the world to quite aggressive neo-con notions.  To include the League of Democracies.  It is absolutely idiotic, and every european I've talked to agrees.  So not sure who is going to join his League.  We already have enough international institutions.  We need to be clarifying and streamlining what they do rather that building more.  Here is a question.  How much of McCain's spending cuts will he need in order to facilitate the budget of the League of Democracies which will sit along side the G-8 and SC that currently fill the role he is looking to replace?  Will he keep funding the budgets of the secretariats of those two IOs and add a third?  It is cognitive dissonance to me.  But I have happily drunk the kool-aid so maybe I'm not the most objective observer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obama's answers seemed to show him as what everyone perceives him to be an internationalist realist.  He did, and has all along, stressed non-proliferation.  And he is right that it is a major threat.  He did well not to back down on missile defense, but I wished he would have tied it in a bit better to his answer on the Russia question rather than on the 9/11 question.  I agree with him about small-scale WMDs being the major threat to homeland security.  I think that he was distancing himself from WMDs as a word and focusing on nuclear weapons as a political maneuver. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most rich moment of the debate was when McCain tried to tie Obama to Bush.  How much of a hot potato has he become?  Obama tried throughout to tie McCain to Bush.  McCain tried throughout to distance himself from Bush.  It was hilarious. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I saw Biden give Obama campaign spin after the debate.  He did his thing.  Preceding him was a senior staffer from the McCain camp.  McCain: unleash the pit bull.  I want to see what she's got.  Looking forward to next Thursday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we'll have to see how it plays politically.  Neither hit it out of the park.  Neither made any big gaffes.  Largely I was bored as much of it was stump and only towards about Russia did they actually get off the stump and talk any substance. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now to my bed.&lt;br>

&lt;p>UPDATE: They are both wrong.  The surge would technically be classified as neither a strategy nor a tactic.  It was an operational response designed to achieve a strategic objective.  So it was an operation. &lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wow.</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-09-25-wow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-09-25-wow/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is simply no other word that I can conjure. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would like to remind everyone that McCain is 73 and has had two, three or four incidents with cancer.  McCain has lived a tough life.  The Presidency routinely causes men not with white hair to go white as an indication of the stresses that are placed on one's body.  I know momma McCain is 92 or whatever, but she wasn't a Prisoner of War, didn't routinely have large amounts of G-force placed on her body over a significant portion of her adult life and didn't spend the rest of her adult life fighting, scrapping, and arguing with everyone and their brother on the hill. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>After knowing that.  Please watch this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Manufacturers and other parties involved with biofuels have agreed on a global&lt;br>
green biofuel standard. The &lt;a href="http://www.bioenergywiki.net/index.php/RSB_Principles_and_Criteria_(version_0)">new&lt;br>
standard&lt;/a> hopefully will eradicate the controversy and confusion that&lt;br>
surrounds biofuels at the moment. Its main guarantee is food security and&lt;br>
signatories include BP and Shell.
The biofuel standard is very similar to the &lt;a href="http://www.fsc.org/">Forest Stewardship Council’&lt;/a>s certification for&lt;br>
different types of paper. The organization behind the biofuel standard is the &lt;a href="http://www.bioenergywiki.net/index.php/Roundtable_on_Sustainable_Biofuels">Roundtable&lt;br>
on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB)&lt;/a>. It is located in Switzerland at the Energy&lt;br>
Center at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The signatories to the new standard include the big league oil companies BP&lt;br>
and Shell as well as more than 300 professionals from organizations linked to&lt;br>
biofuels both in the public and private sector and civil society movements. The&lt;br>
RSB was formed because of all the bad press biofuels are getting and aims to&lt;br>
inform consumers in depth about the good and the bad. &lt;/p>

Russia</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-08-18-georgia-v-russia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-08-18-georgia-v-russia/</guid><description>&lt;p>Because I am intellectually inferior and do not have so much time, I have few unique thoughts. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is some great analysis on the web about the short conflict. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/world/europe/17military.html?ex=1376712000&amp;amp;en=c604c9bdaa4063fd&amp;amp;ei=5124&amp;amp;partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink">NYT &lt;/a>has a great article on the tactics used by the Russians.  I, for one, am not scared by the Russian's ability to employ combined arms in the same manner that we are.  They simply do not have the culture that relies on decentralization necessary to affect true combine arms warfare in the way that we employ CA. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/node/9554">FP Passport&lt;/a> has an interesting article about the incitement of the conflict.  I think that it is fairly evenhanded account and I largely agree with the analysis, from what I know of things…which is limited!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most militarily and culturally interesting point about the conflict is the &lt;a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/08/16/misunderstanding-cyberwar/">absence &lt;/a>or &lt;a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/13425/32396074">presence &lt;/a>of cyberwar.  The big takeaway is that the Pentagon should not wash its hands of the R&amp;amp;D and of the C3 and of the practitioners responsible for employing and defending against these attacks.  Its rhetoric aside, I would not be surprised if they had, nor if they hadn't.  No matter what has been done, moving forward this is an area prime for research and defining where the battle-space will be and many other questions. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_West">Bing West&lt;/a>, who my former co-author knows quite well, and I met once briefly in Iraq while he joined one of my patrols has an interesting interview in a blog I frequent: &lt;a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/">Small Wars Journal&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/2008/08/swj-interview-with-bing-west-p/">Part one is here&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://smallwarsjournal.com/blog/2008/08/part-2-swj-interview-with-bing/">Part two is here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I largely agree with his tactical analysis, especially the part where he exposes his institutional biases and lauds the Marines in Anbar. He also lauds Petraeus ordering people into the neighborhoods, which we were doing after entering Baghdad but ended when we were replaced by the First Cav Division. That is the right tactic now and it was the right tactic then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I want to comment on something that West says in part two. The money quote is here:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The martial values of our society have deteriorated. During World War II, the&lt;br>
press scarcely mentioned and never photographed the dozens (over 140 in all) of&lt;br>
public hangings of American soldiers, and never mentioned the shootings of&lt;br>
German civilians or captured prisoners. The press considered such stories to be&lt;br>
out of bounds. In Iraq, the killings of civilians in Haditha, trumpeted as a&lt;br>
massacre, received vastly more press attention than any valorous action in the&lt;br>
war. The hue and cry was not motivated by a thirst for justice; when&lt;br>
investigations exonerated most of the Marines involved at Haditha, the press&lt;br>
wrote little and said less. In World War II, our nation highlighted courage and&lt;br>
quietly accepted mistakes. Today, we highlight mistakes and quietly accept&lt;br>
valor. On Iwo Jima in 1945, almost six thousand Americans died, many more than&lt;br>
in five years in Iraq. Iwo Jima was a strategic blunder. Today, the press and&lt;br>
Congress would be apoplectic about such a blunder. Courage, Aristotle said, is&lt;br>
the virtue that makes all other virtues possible. Geopolitical wisdom is&lt;br>
admirable, but martial valor is essential to sustain a democracy. American&lt;br>
society takes courage for granted, and the press ignores it. When we fight the&lt;br>
next war, this attitude will poorly serve the nation. Will soldiers risk their&lt;br>
lives, if society ignores courage?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are couple of levels to this comment.  The first is that this statement is ostensibly a tired critique of the &amp;ldquo;liberal media.&amp;rdquo;  The second, more interesting level, is that this is a lament by an old man that our society has gone &amp;ldquo;soft.&amp;rdquo;  Yet, these issues are not so easy to isolate because there is reverse causality, each one informing the other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest, I am tired of the liberal media critique for a number of reasons.  Media is selling a product, deal with it.  The editorial biases that major media outlets have is a reflection of their specific branding which is a reflection of their customer base and the advertising they need to sell in order to maintain a profit or at least operating costs.  Yes, this has always been the case but technology, specifically cable TV and the internet, have taken away the geographical limitations that newspapers and radio had during WWII.  In that era, I think that there was a professional ethos of objectivity because there was a realization that each media outlet had a virtual monopoly.  The social contract was objective reporting in return for the virtual monopoly on information maintained by the few radio outlets and one or two newspapers that society had access to.  Technology has changed that and there is no virtual monopoly at this time.  Media has adapted like any business would: &lt;a href="http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/08/the_ideologies_of_audiences_fo.php">branding&lt;/a>.  This doesn't bother me because increased access in and of itself is a public good.  What does bother me is that society has not adapted by valuing critical thinking.  Something I've commented on before.  Yes, I would agree that many of the major media outlets do have a slightly left of center editorial bias.  This is generally reflective, I would posit, of those who continue to &amp;ldquo;buy&amp;rdquo; their product.  But it is also reflective of the fact that those who run major media outlets are fairly elitist and people in that demographic tend to be left of center on the American political spectrum.  Yet this is abrogated by the fact of access.  Those right of center, my father for instance, have plenty of sources that they can go to to feed their fire.  In no way is there a dearth of information.  The problem is laziness in finding that information and a lack of critical thinking about the information, where it comes from, who is writing it, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The deeper issue remains, however.  This is an area which is ripe for sociological research and I would be very interested to read such research as I have thought about this issue of whether current American society values valor on many occasions. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other night I was having a debate with my Swedish Dove roommate about NATO in Afghanistan mediated by an American-sympathizing Dane.  He said something that informs much of this debate: &amp;ldquo;How can you join a cause you do not believe in?&amp;rdquo;  I had a retort for that comment in the context of the Afghanistan debate but am not sure that I do in the context of the valor issue.  I think that that has a lot to do with it.  I think that American society learned much from the Vietnam experience.  Most people that I know who didn't agree with the war didn't call me a baby-killer for participating in it.  They had learned from the Vietnam war to separate those fighting from those ordering them to fight.  West's argument about how WWII was so valorous and how generally turned a blind eye to atrocities committed by Americans and held tightly to Iwo Jima flag raising moments is likely true.  Yet American society was not without its critics at the time.  The Nuremberg prosecutors and judges returning were pariahs for abrogating many of the protections that people felt vital in the case of war crimes tribunals.  The scourge of internment camps took years to overcome. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many other items that one can point to that will show that American culture did not possess any self-critique of the methods used to fight WWII.  There is a certain lack of history there where the conversations of the citizenry are not as easy to catalog as today where many conversations are memorialized in blogs, podcasts and other Web 2.0 types of outlets. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, that is largely beside the point.  My feeling is that American's do value valor society-wide but it is hard for them to hold up valor when they do not believe unitarily in the cause as they did in WWII.  Every conflict that the US has participated in since WWII has reflected a more fractured society.  This is to be lauded rather than lamented.  It reflects that our democracy is maturing.  It reflects an ability of historians and media to report on and take action based upon the prevailing notions of the polity. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the beginning of Iraq, when there was a simpler view of that conflict, items that tended towards valor were reported.  Think about that woman who was a &amp;ldquo;prisoner of war.&amp;rdquo;  Think about the outcries of joy the day we pulled down the statute.  There are other examples.  Eventually as public opinion swung against the war and a more critical view of the mission itself the media changed what it was reporting on (the modification of its product both drove and was in response to changes in customer preferences). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all that aside, to the deeper issue.  My view is that American culture does value valor.  Our popular culture since at least the 1920s is essentially hero worship.  Our movies since the beginning have been homages to romantic heroes.  Our literature has similar tendencies when viewed on the macro-level.  Our music is a bit more fractured but largely is based upon romanticism and hero worship.  Now the form and persona of the hero definitely is a moving target, but there is always a level of courage required to overcome the problem.  When one compares American movies, literature and music to European movies, literature and music there is a tangible difference a major one is the romanticism that American pop culture seethes.  Another is the love of the hero.  These tangible differences, when combined with what I felt from others when I returned from Iraq (and not only in my red state, but also in the navy blue enclaves that I migrated to after getting out of the USMC), inform my thought that America is not about to lose its ability to mobilize valorous people. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>What politicians just need to realize is that it will never be easy to mobilize, yet I think that if we were to find ourselves truly and undoubtedly under attack the ability to mobilize heroic persons on the battlefield will not be difficult.  Yet, what politicians must also realize is that the self-critical nature of the maturing American democracy is going to debate any conflict that we will find ourselves in.  It always has and it always will.  This is a good thing.  Any burying in the sand by military hawks is unfortunate.  One way that as a society we have walked this line is by dislocating the military from modern culture.  This is unfortunate, but a complex topic I will leave for another day.  For now suffice it to say that personally I take West's comments with a grain of salt and do not agree with his dystopic view of America's ability to fight the conflicts that will keep our people safe.&lt;/p>

To be honest, I’ve never fully understood the vehement Anti-Americanism that I have at times been the target of.  I did understand it the few times I experienced it in Iraq.  Mainly, it is the European anti-americanism that I do not fully understand.  I usually dismiss it as some sort of a simple jealousy and unwillingness to part with the past and realize that the world has moved on.  I know that that is a simplistic understanding of a complex issue.  That is why I enjoy reading well-phrased articles by European thinkers on the subject.  The UK Times ran [this][2] piece today, which I found quite thoughtful.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Europeans that I’ve met during the election campaign, like their idealistically blinded progressive counterparts in the U.S. seem to think that Obama is going to cure everything that ills the nation.  As I said in my analysis of his foreign policy, that isn’t going to happen.  The inertia of what has already taken place over decades will constrain him; the centrifugal pull of bureaucratic organizational design will constrain him; and the fact that he isn’t a dictator and is still beholden to the other two branches of government will constrain him.  Obama will (hopefully) give a style, a flavor, and a presence to the US presidency that has been lacking since Reagan (or JFK, depending on which side of the aisle you sit).  That is what I am excited for.  However he will end up getting mocked and ridiculed by the Euro’s eventually.  He will get called a hawk and a war-monger.  He will likely be called many of the same things that GWB has been called.  My hope is that those calling names will be fewer, have less basis for their arguments and generally be classified as radical rather than mainstream. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This last part sort of goes to the heart of the matter.  In many ways Europe needs us to be the war-mongering bad cop to their peacenik good cop.  It provides the security assurances as well as progress that have regulated most of the world (albeit badly in a very many instances) since the end of the Cold War.  And yet, no one on this side of the Atlantic is ever willing to admit that!  We grumble and saber rattle at the Iranians while they negotiate with the Iranians.  We scare people into their arms.  All the while, information is being passed back and forth under the table as there is no way you’ll be able to convince me that the intelligence services are not talking to each other on each of these issues.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yet, that requires a lot of water.  And water is expensive, currently $8 per cubic meter if we truck it up or $3 per cubic meter on the nights that the water board decides to pump water into the main.  We do have a big reservoir for holding the water we use inside the house and a pump to pump it to the tanks on the roof to keep some semblance of water pressure.  We also use this water to keep our garden, orchard, bushes and trees alive. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our gardener is really good.  He has created a nice irrigation path for the water that comes into the compound from the hill above as well as much of the water that flows off the roof and around the compound.  Much of this water does get into the garden and orchard.  The problem is that it creates huge puddles that do eventually seep into the soil but generally deteriorate the fragile topsoils as well as create huge runoff problems, bringing all the crap into the compound from outside.  They have done their best with shovels, but now I’m going to have to bring in the heavy equipment!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last night’s rainstorm finally gave me a chance to see how the water was running into, out of, and around the compound.  We found four places where it will be useful and where we are able to build rainwater retention reservoirs.  These will capture the rainwater and let us use it to keep the garden alive with in the between rains.  It will also keep the massive pools of water from wreaking havoc on the top soil.  So we cited and sized the locations for the four new reservoirs.  We went out this morning to purchase most of the equipment we’ll need to dig the two primary reservoirs.  Since it came out of my pocket, I’m going to have to wait until another paycheck to do the final two.  And now we are in the process of creating these things. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the part of living in a developing country that I love.  The freedom to do what you want and know is right; the interaction with people who know different things than you do; and the realization that everything is essentially the same if you look hard enough for it.  You may have to do a lot of things yourself, but that is also exciting to me.  In the States I call someone and they provide me a service.  Here it is not so easy.  Since we’ve moved into this compound I’ve been a plumber or supervised VERY closely another plumber, I’ve also been or supervised electricians, carpenters, IT consultants, glass dealers, gardeners, hydrologic engineers, structural engineer, construction engineer, mechanical engineer, interior designer and many other trades that I never would have had the opportunity to become elsewhere. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Supervising the building of these reservoirs will serve as the beginning of my learning curve for my next major project: building the first pool in this country and making it solar/wind powered and chemical free using a new salt chlorination system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But first, back to my day job.&lt;/p>

[This ][2]is good news, and something that I’ve been thinking about for a while.  The Europeans want to build gigantic solar power stations in the Sahara and pipe the electricity up via high capacity transmission lines under the Med to the European grid system. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83453a81b69e200e553ceb2078834-pi">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83453a81b69e200e553ceb2078834-pi&lt;/a>

&lt;p>Although I have to laud this idea, I have two problems/concerns with this.  First, the centralization of the power grid is something that I have philosophical problems with.  All though economies of scale are certainly at work, there are problems when you have fewer nodes in the system.  Also if the plan only calls for a limited amount of transmission lines under the Med then there could be problems centralizing that.  A few depth charges could take out all of Europe’s power, or less nefariously, any technical problems with the transmission lines could have drastic effects throughout an entire region that is vital to the world economy.  I would like this much better if we could figure out a way to transfer the energy physically, by storing it at the solar sight in some way and then shipping it to Europe for energy release onto the grid system.  Although I have no idea if this is scientifically feasible or if the energy losses in the storage and release with the additional energy transfer (solar to “chemical” to electricity rather than solar to electricity) would make it counterproductive, it seems that if that technology could be designed than freeing the grid up around the world would be much, much easier.  My other problem with this is that there is no commitment to enhancing the infrastructure of the African grid system.  The lines could just as easily be run south.  In fact they could be run south easier in many cases (as long as you could get the authority from the sovereigns along the way) as it is overland rather than undersea.  So here the Euros are gripping and moaning about how the Africans have no power and in typical post-imperial fashion are perfectly willing to invest massive amounts of dollars in needed infrastructure improvements but only to the extent that they are able to extract the sunlight for their benefit. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Come ON!  I hope that the pan-Africanists in the North African region will prevail upon the Europeans that if they do grant them the rights to build such a system that they also make commitments to running power lines south.  Yes, I understand that you cannot easily tap into the African grid system (as such a thing does not exist), but if we are going to be tied into grids then this would be an important first step in that direction.  If the Euro’s can make a commitment to building the structures and then provide enough electricity for Africa as well, with the responsibilities on the African nations to come to an agreement on building the transmission lines and some other decentralized nodes to support the system, then I am 100% on board.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The text of the recent speech is &lt;a href="http://my.barackobama.com/page/community/post/amandascott/gGxkFr">here&lt;/a>. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will respond, fairly randomly to each of his five points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1)  Iraq.  I’ve been saying for months that despite their rhetoric every one of the major candidates will do virtually the same thing in Iraq.  This convergence is happening.  What I didn’t predict is that Bush would actually start to converge.  That was new.  I have advocated for over two years that we should draw down our troops in the middle once the Iraqis are able to sustain relative security and then sink savings into infrastructure and job creation programs.  This should be done while bolstering border security and hunting terrorists in western Iraq.  This is exactly what Obama is proposing.  Thus my genius.  What is left out of this debate is the fact that the majority of the Marines currently operating in western Iraq are not in this commitment to draw down.  They may be replaced by JSOC operatives eventually (I suspect that will be the long-term solution), but they are going to represent a major force commitment for a long time.  Despite his adherence to the no-bases policy, I think he may be forced to backtrack on that one.  It will depend on what Iran does and it will depend on political developments within Iraq.  I think that a basing strategy, if smartly pursued (read small), is in our national interests.  If nothing, we will want to keep the Umm Qasr and Basrah areas open to deploy from like we did with Kuwait.  Although Kuwait will continue to work, it will be further from the action than Basrah if things get out of hand. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the most part, however, I’m not sure what McCain envisions that his bases will do.  He seems to imply that he wants major bases.  I understand his argument.  I’m just not sure what his vision or mission for those troops will be.  Our SOFA with Japan has modern day relevance, strategically.  For it is from Okinawa and the large mainland bases where we would launch any strategic action were North Korea to head south or China to head across the channel.  Our SOFA with Germany has less modern day relevance, which is why we’ve been drawing down the bases.  We are keeping major hospitals there, which is the next stage trauma victims go after they are stabilized in country.  But it doesn’t make sense to keep major, strategic bases in Iraq.  First it is access.  Ships have to get into the gulf.  A regional action (read Iran sweeps around to Saudi) would be able to cut off access to the gulf.  That would isolate any bases we kept in Iraq from resupply.  That makes little sense.  Although the Navy would be able to damn the torpedoes, the choke point entering the gulf would become a grave yard.  Secondly, mission.  Although regional stability is obviously within our interests, I’m not convinced that a basing presence would enhance that.  It sounds too much like me that we would be choosing sides when we may not want to choose sides in any possible future conflict.  We may want to, but we may want to reserve the right which side to choose.  Basing in Iraq permanently may prove problematic.  Or it may ensure that we have such interests in the state that we are willing to ensure puppet regimes for the foreseeable future (likely the neo-con argument). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this is why I’m predisposed to tactical and operational level bases in the southeast of Iraq but nothing more.  It would allow us to pull out quickly if we needed to, but still keep our foot in the door.  We can arrange the SOFA with Iraq to ensure we have priority rights at the port if there was a security crisis.  This will enhance our current range beyond Kuwait.  I know that Basrah isn’t very far removed from Kuwait, but I think overall that the access to Iran is what will prove the strategic deterrent.  If I were king of the world, that is where I would put our missile defense systems.  But more on Iran soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2.  Afghanistan.  Yes.  Pakistan.  Yes.  Nothing really to add here. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>3.  Nuclear Non-Proliferation.  Agree, we need to update the treaty.  Agree, we need to secure lose fissile material, especially by working with Russia.  However, to a large extent that ship has sailed.  It is on the market.  It will take a wide-base multilateral effort to secure all of this.  That is what Obama is advocating for.  Good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two points here.  One.  I enjoy that this issue is back on the table, but personally I wonder whether we are too focused on the N and not on the BC.  Biological and Chemical weapons are going to be easier to manufacture, transport and employ than most nuclear weapons.   That is what really concerns me when we talk about terrorist organizations with a worldwide reach and an axe to grind. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two.  Iran.  I’m less concerned than many about Iran getting the bomb.  I think that there isn’t’ going to be much that will stop the international community from them getting the bomb.  They are smart, they are resourceful and they are fairly self-sufficient (especially when combined with the friends that they do have in the world).  I think that the focus on prohibiting their nuclear program is the wrong focus.  To Iranians it is an issue of regional pride, they want it before the Arabs.  If they are able to build a nuclear weapon I think that a regional level MAD will keep the situation stable.  Everyone knows that we gave Israel nuclear weapons long ago.  They also have the delivery capacity.  We also keep enough nuclear submarines in the region to ensure that Iran will be destroyed long before Israel will.  The Iranians do not seem to me to be as compulsive as everyone gives them credit for.  They have a fairly rational (if provocative) foreign policy.  The concern, I realize, is what happens if the ayatollahs fall from power and chaos ensues.  Well, I think that if that happens and if my small basing strategy is pursued, then we fly in and secure the sites.  In my world view, Israel is much more likely to launch a preemptive nuclear strike than the Iranians.  The reason is Israel has fewer friends that are Iran’s neighbors than Iran does.  Although there are tensions between Iranians and Jordan/Syria, any strike by Iran on Israel will have MASSIVE fallout effects in Jordan and likely Lebanon/Syria.  Most will likely be blown over to Jordan if the prevailing winds do in fact point straight west.  However, containing the fallout will not be easy.  No matter how much Iran doesn’t want Israel around and no matter how much tension there is between them and the Arab states further east, I think that the religious alliances will prevail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>4.  Energy security.  Yes.  Fully support the amount he proffers for R&amp;amp;D.  This is absolutely essential national security issue. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>5.  Realigning our reputation.  There are quite a few parts to this, and I would like to see more on this issue and him to give an entire speech on how and what he intends to pursue which falls under this heading.  I think his development ‘graphs were weak.  Too much Sachs and too little Collier for my taste.  I actually liked that Easterly blew it up.  I had a feeling that he would.  I think that Obama will get this right, but I’m not yet convinced that his idealistic domestic policy will spill over to aid rather than his fairly pragmatic foreign policy.  I hesitate to endorse his new institution, something with Security that I”m too lazy to look up.  We al&lt;br>
ready have too many institutions.  Why was there nothing on how he would reform the UN?  Why was there nothing on conflict and peace building?  Why is there so little on African policy?  Why was there nothing about his views on Kyoto or the ICC or the Law of the Sea or many of the other major treaties where we are currently outliers?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, have a conference call.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while.  One of the problems when we finally &amp;amp; slowly switch over to a more eco-friendly method of electricity generation is that the power grid will have to substantially change from a few precise nodes in a system to many dispersed nodes in the system.  It is going to have to be decentralized.  Another thing that likely will have to change also is how power is stored and delivered.  Hopefully some solid state power cells can be developed.  The exciting thing is that if that were to happen then much of the world that is in the sunbelt will be able to develop power and charge solid-state devices.  If the transportation networks can support it then places that currently have little natural resources except for sun, wind or waves will be able to develop electricity for the north which has less sunlight but is able to pay for their energy in a way that the sunbelt is not.  However, this is unlikely to happen for a long time due to the lack of effective tech-transfer, despite such provisions being written into every major environmental treaty. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK off to my day.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wired's Thomas Goetz emails to make a great point about Obama's big &lt;a href="http://www.fightthesmears.com">FightTheSmears.com&lt;/a> rollout today:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>By putting their own website out there front-and-center, and then getting&lt;br>
everybody to link to it (starting with all the media covering the launch of the&lt;br>
site), the result will be to drive fightthesmears.com towards the top of a&lt;br>
Google search on, say, &amp;ldquo;obama muslim&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;michelle obama whitey.&amp;rdquo; Ideally, if&lt;br>
enough of the pro-Obama network links to fightthesmears.com, it'll drive the&lt;br>
sites that peddle in the rumor-mongering, which are now the first results on&lt;br>
said searches, off the top of the results list. Ideal long term result: any&lt;br>
curious low-information voter who eventually bothers to google these pesky&lt;br>
rumors will immediately be led to the debunking rather than the rumor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My&lt;br>
take: Did the Obama campaign create fightthesmears.com to game Google? If so,&lt;br>
they're even more net-savvy than folks give them credit for.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Indeed, Obama already had a protype of this page connected to his &lt;a href="http://factcheck.barackobama.com">Fact Check &lt;/a>site, and even bought &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0108/An_antirumor_Google_ad.html">Google&lt;br>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>According to the storyline that drives many advocacy groups and Democratic&lt;br>
activists – a storyline often reflected in comments on this blog – we are up&lt;br>
against a sharply partisan, radically conservative, take-no-prisoners Republican&lt;br>
party.  They have beaten us twice by energizing their base with red meat&lt;br>
rhetoric and single-minded devotion and discipline to their agenda.  In order to&lt;br>
beat them, it is necessary for Democrats to get some backbone, give as good as&lt;br>
they get, brook no compromise, drive out Democrats who are interested in&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;appeasing&amp;rdquo; the right wing, and enforce a more clearly progressive agenda.  The&lt;br>
country, finally knowing what we stand for and seeing a sharp contrast, will&lt;br>
rally to our side and thereby usher in a new progressive era. I think this&lt;br>
perspective misreads the American people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>From traveling throughout Illinois and more recently around the country, I&lt;br>
can tell you that Americans are suspicious of labels and suspicious of jargon. &lt;br>
They don't think George Bush is mean-spirited or prejudiced, but have become&lt;br>
aware that his administration is irresponsible and often incompetent.  They&lt;br>
don't think that corporations are inherently evil (a lot of them work in&lt;br>
corporations), but they recognize that big business, unchecked, can fix the game&lt;br>
to the detriment of working people and small entrepreneurs.  They don't think&lt;br>
America is an imperialist brute, but are angry that the case to invade Iraq was&lt;br>
exaggerated, are worried that we have unnecessarily alienated existing and&lt;br>
potential allies around the world, and are ashamed by events like those at Abu&lt;br>
Ghraib which violate our ideals as a country.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's this non-ideological lens through which much of the country viewed Judge&lt;br>
Roberts&amp;rsquo; confirmation hearings.   A majority of folks, including a number of&lt;br>
Democrats and Independents, don't think that John Roberts is an ideologue bent&lt;br>
on overturning every vestige of civil rights and civil liberties protections in&lt;br>
our possession.  Instead, they have good reason to believe he is a conservative&lt;br>
judge who is (like it or not) within the mainstream of American jurisprudence, a&lt;br>
judge appointed by a conservative president who could have done much worse (and&lt;br>
probably, I fear, may do worse with the next nominee).  While they hope Roberts&lt;br>
doesn't swing the court too sharply to the right, a majority of Americans think&lt;br>
that the President should probably get the benefit of the doubt on a clearly&lt;br>
qualified nominee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A plausible argument can be made that too much is at stake here and now, in&lt;br>
terms of privacy issues, civil rights, and civil liberties, to give John Roberts&lt;br>
the benefit of the doubt.  That certainly was the operating assumption of the&lt;br>
advocacy groups involved in the nomination battle. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I shared enough of these concerns that I voted against Roberts on the floor&lt;br>
this morning.  But short of mounting an all-out filibuster — a quixotic fight I&lt;br>
would not have supported; a fight I believe Democrats would have lost both in&lt;br>
the Senate and in the court of public opinion; a fight that would have been&lt;br>
difficult for Democratic senators defending seats in states like North Dakota&lt;br>
and Nebraska that are essential for Democrats to hold if we hope to recapture&lt;br>
the majority; and a fight that would have effectively signaled an unwillingness&lt;br>
on the part of Democrats to confirm any Bush nominee, an unwillingness which I&lt;br>
believe would have set a dangerous precedent for future administrations –&lt;br>
blocking Roberts was not a realistic option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In such circumstances, attacks on Pat Leahy, Russ Feingold and the other&lt;br>
Democrats who, after careful consideration, voted for Roberts make no sense. &lt;br>
Russ Feingold, the only Democrat to vote not only against war in Iraq but also&lt;br>
against the Patriot Act, doesn't become complicit in the erosion of civil&lt;br>
liberties simply because he chooses to abide by a deeply held and legitimate&lt;br>
view that a President, having won a popular election, is entitled to some&lt;br>
benefit of the doubt when it comes to judicial appointments. Like it or not,&lt;br>
that view has pretty strong support in the Constitution's design.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Nevertheless, the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/magazine/15parenting-t.html?ex=1371009600&amp;amp;en=ec6fd160e6b4089c&amp;amp;ei=5124&amp;amp;partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink">NY Times Magazine&lt;/a> has a great piece on shared parenting that has gotten me thinking.  First a few quotes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The most recent figures from the University of Wisconsin’s National Survey of Families and Households show that the average wife does 31 hours of housework a week while the average husband does 14 — a ratio of slightly more than two to one.&lt;br>
…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lopsided ratio holds true however you construct and deconstruct&lt;br>
a family. “Working class, middle class, upper class, it stays at two to&lt;br>
one,” says Sampson Lee Blair, an associate professor of sociology at&lt;br>
the University at Buffalo who studies the division of labor in&lt;br>
families.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“And the most sadly comic data is from my own&lt;br>
research,” he adds, which show that in married couples “where she has a&lt;br>
job and he doesn’t, and where you would anticipate a complete reversal,&lt;br>
even then you find the wife doing the majority of the housework.”&lt;br>
…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is one pocket of American parenting in which equality is the norm or, at least, the mutually-agreed-upon goal. Same-sex couples cannot default to gender when deciding who does what at home. How these parents make their decisions, therefore, sheds some light on why married men and women act the way they do. They are the exceptions that both prove and challenge the rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Heterosexual couples can learn from gay couples about sharing housework and child care,” says Esther D. Rothblum, a professor in the women’s studies department of San Diego State University whose comparative study of the relationships of 342 couples — lesbian, gay, heterosexual — was published in the journal Developmental Psychology in January. “They are good role models.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are a ton of other good nuggets of wisdom in the piece.  But here is the money quote: &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sure, some of their tasks would fall along traditional gender lines. The point, they say, is not to spit at tradition for the heck of it but rather to think things through instead of defaulting to gender.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think that for whatever reason that is almost exactly my world-view.  As my wedding is beginning its slow march towards reality I have been thinking a lot about gender roles, about tradition and about what the word &amp;ldquo;partner&amp;rdquo; really means to me. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sad news is that I have few very few answers to any of these solutions.  But I know that I am less tied to traditional views than many.  That does not mean that I eschew traditional gender roles.  At times, for whatever reason, they can be a handy resource.  When in a hurry Highlands cleans better and faster than I do (although my mother ensured that I would not be inadequate at housework, a value which many years of menial jobs reinforced).  I know things like turn on the car heater when your vehicle is overheating. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, the thing about these is when they become forced resentment brews.  I like the notion that is teased out in the article that what is important is expectations.  When those diverge and inevitably are not met resentment, frustration and anger build.  What is important?  Communicating what someone's expectations are to one's partner.  Many of the stories in the article are a bit kooky.  I do not foresee making color coded charts, but the themes of communicating expectations and embracing those that vary slightly from your own resonate very much with me.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Have seen a million reasons why the Clinton/Obama ticket will not happen.  Not the least of which is that Bill likely doesn't want the RNC looking too deeply into his sketchy financial dealings over the past few years.  Another theory is that if she really believes that he can't win better for her not to be running mate so as to position for 2012 and &amp;ldquo;I told you so.&amp;rdquo;  Were he to win, then she would be in the same position whether Veep, Cabinet or Senator.  Jimmy Carter has talked about getting all of the downsides of each rather than all of the upsides of each.  Despite the dystopian overtones, I understand his argument.  I think she gets into a revamped Cabinet.  Along with Edwards, Gore (I hope), and Biden – each in their functional areas of expertise.  That would be a liberal's wet dream cabinet.  Who does that leave?  MY BOY, RICHARDSON, Sebillius, Webb and a few others. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is &lt;a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/198827.php">the email&lt;/a> that HRC sent to supporters:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dear XXX,&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I wanted you to be one of the first to know: on Saturday, I will&lt;br>
hold an event in Washington D.C. to thank everyone who has supported my&lt;br>
campaign. Over the course of the last 16 months, I have been privileged&lt;br>
and touched to witness the incredible dedication and sacrifice of so&lt;br>
many people working for our campaign. Every minute you put into helping&lt;br>
us win, every dollar you gave to keep up the fight meant more to me&lt;br>
than I can ever possibly tell you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On Saturday, I will extend my congratulations to Senator Obama and&lt;br>
my support for his candidacy. This has been a long and hard-fought&lt;br>
campaign, but as I have always said, my differences with Senator Obama&lt;br>
are small compared to the differences we have with Senator McCain and&lt;br>
the Republicans.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I have said throughout the campaign that I would strongly support&lt;br>
Senator Obama if he were the Democratic Party's nominee, and I intend&lt;br>
to deliver on that promise.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When I decided to run for president, I knew exactly why I was&lt;br>
getting into this race: to work hard every day for the millions of&lt;br>
Americans who need a voice in the White House.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I made you — and everyone who supported me — a promise: to stand&lt;br>
up for our shared values and to never back down. I'm going to keep that&lt;br>
promise today, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I will be speaking on Saturday about how together we can rally the&lt;br>
party behind Senator Obama. The stakes are too high and the task before&lt;br>
us too important to do otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I know as I continue my lifelong work for a stronger America and a&lt;br>
better world, I will turn to you for the support, the strength, and the&lt;br>
commitment that you have shown me in the past 16 months. And I will&lt;br>
always keep faith with the issues and causes that are important to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the past few days, you have shown that support once again with&lt;br>
hundreds of thousands of messages to the campaign, and again, I am&lt;br>
touched by your thoughtfulness and kindness.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I can never possibly express my gratitude, so let me say simply, thank you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sincerely,&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Hillary Rodham Clinton&lt;/p>

[(Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty.)][2] &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Andrew Sullivan][3] has some phenomenal reactions about Barack’s seeming win up today.  The first is a story that choked me up told by one of Andrew’s [readers][4]: &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My grandfather, 86 years old and a veteran of WWII, just&lt;br>
gave me a call. He was calling all of his grandchildren to let them&lt;br>
know what an important night this was in the history of our country.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Grandpa drove a truck for over 50 years, and he told the story of&lt;br>
how he drove with a team of drivers, 2 white (including him), and 4&lt;br>
black. When they stopped at the truck stops, the black drivers had to&lt;br>
use seperate restrooms and showers, and had to eat in a small room in&lt;br>
the back of the kitchen. Grandpa and his co-driver would eat in the&lt;br>
back with the rest of the team, and while they didn’t speak of it at&lt;br>
the time, they knew it was wrong yet felt powerless to change it, and&lt;br>
believed that it would never change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Tonight, he told me, we have come full-circle. Many people,&lt;br>
especially the younger generation who supported Obama, will never fully&lt;br>
realize the historical import of what happened tonight. But he wanted&lt;br>
his grandchildren to know this story that he had never told us, and it&lt;br>
was the second time in my 33 years that I have heard my grandpa cry.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The other is Andrew’s [reaction ][2]to Barack’s speech he gave last night (you), this morning (me): &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If I needed reassurance that this man is the most formidable force&lt;br>
in American politics today, his speech tonight confirmed it. It was&lt;br>
shrewd – with an artful positioning on Iraq. It was graceful – with&lt;br>
respect for McCain’s service and Clinton’s tenacity. It was brutal – in&lt;br>
turning around McCain’s Iraq visit meme to domestic economic woes. It&lt;br>
was patriotic – in its evocation of Gettysburg and the Second World&lt;br>
War. It was outer-directed: not for Obama the recourse to&lt;br>
self-satisfied identity politics of the kind used by the Clintons&lt;br>
because they often have nothing else. It was moving. I thought I even&lt;br>
saw some suggestions of tears as he remembered his grandmother. It was&lt;br>
also rhetorically more powerful than McCain – not by a small amount but&lt;br>
by a mile. Put McCain’s speech against Obama’s – and this was a&lt;br>
wipe-out. Not a victory. A wipe-out. Rhetorically, they are simply not&lt;br>
in the same league. And if the contrast tonight between McCain and&lt;br>
Obama holds for the rest of the campaign, McCain is facing a defeat of&lt;br>
historic proportions.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One more thing: with McCain’s and Clinton’s speeches, you could not&lt;br>
forget the politics of it. With Obama, you forgot about that at times.&lt;br>
You actually lifted your eyes a little and believed a little and hoped&lt;br>
a little.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Yes, he can. And anyone who under-estimates that will regret it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I awoke at five this morning and timed it perfectly as he was about to take the stage when I got the TV sorted.  CNN had audio but no visual as the signal was scrambled.  Luckily for me BBC carried the entire thing, except for a vital moment during his wind up at the end where the signal died and I cursed to all hell the Somali desert winds that were impeding my political joy. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a related note, the NY Times had this grand photo of the Obamas watching Hillary’s speech.  I think the frustration on Michelle’s face and the stoicism on Barack’s face are more telling than any words I can write.  As I thought more about it I became more and more irate at HRC’s intransigence and utter lack of class.  This night was all about her for her, and a third about her for Obama.  It is over.  She needs to face it and the DNC elites need to ensure that she faces it.  I am frustrated at the apparent spinelessness of the party supremos.  Why are they so scared of Bill’s wrath? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I couldn’t see her comment, I heard Donna Brazille (a superdelegate and CNN commentator) say something akin to, “well, I didn’t support him because he didn’t need me to put him over the top.”  That is utter crap.  You are a middle aged black woman.  Don’t tell me he doesn’t need your support!  The DNC could learn a lot from the discipline of the RNC.  I told Big_Head today when I called because of happiness that the DNC can be maddening with its uber-hippy notions of flaunting of discipline.  Sometimes that is fantastic, but this isn’t one of them.  And, by the way, if I hear one more time that HRC is doing this for her supporters I’m going to stab 48 pencils into the eye of the first person I see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In any event, the man I came late to support is now the first candidate of color from a major American party.  Hooray!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, the [photo][5]: &lt;/p>

&lt;p>~ # ~&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AFRICOM and WAPO</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-06-03-africom-and-wapo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-06-03-africom-and-wapo/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have been fascinated to watch how AFRICOM develops.  &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/31/AR2008053102055.html?nav=rss_email/components">Washington Post&lt;/a> has a very interesting article the other day about how AFRICOM has been received on the continent.  The gist of the article contains two interrelated theorems: (1) that Bush's rhetorical fascination with terrorism has pigeon-holed his foreign policy measures that have little to do with terrorism; (2) that African leaders and American policy makers are like Somali Pirates and French Sailors passing each other quietly in the night with little understanding of the other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the quote that sums up the article is:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Under Africom, one command will consolidate military responsibility for&lt;br>
all of Africa, excluding Egypt. Although it encompasses the volatile&lt;br>
Horn of Africa and the U.S. Navy's forward operating base in Djibouti&lt;br>
and will take over training tasks on the continent, it has no other&lt;br>
dedicated troop components. &amp;ldquo;There are very few scenarios which would&lt;br>
create a U.S. military intervention&amp;rdquo; in Africa, said one Africom&lt;br>
officer who was not authorized to speak on the record. &amp;ldquo;Arguably, there&lt;br>
are no scenarios.&amp;rdquo;
With its headquarters on the continent, liaison groups of 20 to 30&lt;br>
military personnel established in key countries and U.S. units brought&lt;br>
in to help with development and relief tasks, the command was&lt;br>
envisioned as an example to Africans of how their own armed forces and&lt;br>
civilians could work together for the good of their nations.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The trouble was, no one consulted the Africans. &amp;ldquo;Very little was&lt;br>
really known by the majority of people or countries in Africa who were&lt;br>
supposed to know before such a move was made,&amp;rdquo; said retired Kenyan army&lt;br>
Lt. Gen. Daniel Opande. Worry swept the continent that the United&lt;br>
States planned major new military installations in Africa.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;If you know the politics of Africa,&amp;rdquo; said Opande, who has headed&lt;br>
U.N. peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone and Liberia, &amp;ldquo;you know there&lt;br>
are certain very powerful countries who said, no, we are not interested&lt;br>
in having a headquarters here.&amp;rdquo; South Africa and Nigeria were among&lt;br>
them, and their resistance helped persuade others.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Over the past seven years, the administration has more than tripled&lt;br>
U.S. assistance to Africa, to about $9 billion annually, nearly half of&lt;br>
which is spent on prevention and treatment for HIV-AIDS. U.S. military&lt;br>
training for African forces has steadily expanded, and U.S. troops have&lt;br>
undertaken humanitarian missions in several countries — digging wells,&lt;br>
building schools and providing medical care. Africom's budget request&lt;br>
for 2009 is about $400 million.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>But despite the promise of new development and security&lt;br>
partnerships, many Africans concluded that Africom was primarily an&lt;br>
extension of U.S. counterterrorism policy, intended to keep an eye on&lt;br>
Africa's large Muslim population.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I think everyone thought it would be widely greeted as something&lt;br>
positive,&amp;rdquo; the Africom officer said. &amp;ldquo;But you suddenly have wide&lt;br>
publics that have no idea what we're talking about. . . . It was seen&lt;br>
as a massive infusion of military might onto a continent that was quite&lt;br>
proud of having removed foreign powers from its soil.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The United States &amp;ldquo;equates terrorism with Islam,&amp;rdquo; senior Kenyan&lt;br>
diplomat Bethuel Kiplagat said, and few African governments wanted to&lt;br>
be seen as inviting U.S. surveillance on their own people.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations&lt;br>
African affairs subcommittee, thought Africom was &amp;ldquo;something that would&lt;br>
show real respect for Africa.&amp;rdquo; But there was no question, Feingold&lt;br>
said, that the concept had &amp;ldquo;a neocolonialist feel to it.&amp;rdquo;

&lt;p>I was talking to our interpreter the other day about the people who fly in the qat from Ethiopia.  They bring them in on small planes, not necessarily because it is illegal, just because that is the infrastructure arrangement.  They also bring them in from the Southern part of S and have to use the planes presumably to avoid the anti-aircraft guns that the TFG and or the UIC may or may not possess.  But most of these planes are flown by former Soviet Union Air Force pilots. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stereotype was first formed through movies and books of the rogue Russian pilots who will do anything with their planes.  Here it takes it to a new extreme.  They will pack people into planes so tightly that some will have to stand through entire flights.  They will leave the cockpit to come to the back and dig out seats from the cargo hold of the plane and start reassembling the plane while there are passengers sitting in the compartment.  Because, you know on the last flight they had a load of sheep and had to take out the seats.  They will fly their little planes so drunk that they will miss the runway, land somewhere near it and just walk away from their planes and leave them wherever they landed. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have heard all of these stories and have seen glimpses of the stereotypes throughout some of my journeys.  Last night, however, I had my first eye-to-eye experience.  I was in my room and it was a pleasant evening outside.  So I was standing at the window with the screen open enjoying the cool air after a nice thunderstorm.  There are big curtains in my room and they were behind me so I couldn't really see what was happening. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I was peacefully enjoying the cool air and quiet I heard the seat of my toilet fall.  Since it was breezy I didn't think anything of it.  Then I heard another bang but didn't think anything of that either.  A few seconds after the noises I see something move out of the corner of my eye.  I was pretty startled and turned around to see a man pulling the blanket back on my bed and sitting down on it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first I was startled, then I was confused.  Was this some sort of a new turn down service that the hotel had instituted?  Did the staff not know I was here (as I was hidden in the curtains) and come in for a quick snooze?  I said, &amp;ldquo;excuse me….&amp;rdquo; and came out from behind the curtains. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The human sitting on my bed looked up drearily and it was a white guy and so wasn't the staff.  I smelled him before I could make out his face, the stench of his boozing preceded him. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I told the man that he was in the room.  He had his shirt off showing off a massive barrel chest with rock hard stomach (and I don't mean abs….&lt;a href="http://www.benderball.com/">I love my abdominals….I love my belly….I love my abdominals&lt;/a>…this guy loved his food and booze).  He also was barefooted, had a head as big as a lion's, and of course he was wearing blue warm up pants.  AND SITTING ON MY BED.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We began to argue a bit about why he was there.  He got pretty belligerent with me for a bit and then got quite apologetic.  He started to pace around my room and ask me what I had done with his stuff.  I replied that this was my stuff and that he was in my room.  The door to the suite was open and the door to the suite across the hall was open.  I glanced out in the hall and back at him quickly (to make sure that the f-er wasn't going to appropriate any of my stuff) and there was about 18 room service trays in there with tin foil and bowls and cups everywhere.  His TV was on at about 84 trillion decibels. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>During one of his apologetic swings I asked him what his room number was.  He said the room number on the door across the hall, but I could not make him comprehend that the room he was sitting in was not the room that he was given.  During one of his acrimonious swings he told me that he was a great customer here and that this was going to be his room.  I began to think that he wanted to trade rooms rather than just being drunken and disoriented.  During one of his apologetic swings he called down to the front desk, but either it was busy or he hung up on them.  During one of his acrimonious swings he told me that he was a captain and that I should respect him. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I thought, you're a bit old to be a captain.  I also thought, I'm a Captain too Mother F, now get the hell out of my room.  But despite my belligerent tendencies I belayed my sarcasm.  If you wonder why, *see supra.  *Although he was drunk, he probably had fought a time or two in his life while drunk and, HE WAS HUGE. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So after ten minutes of me telling him to get out of my room and him telling me to get out of his room and him swinging back and forth between sorry and angry and me thinking about the nice calm cool air outside and him not able to talk English very well and me not able to talk Russian at all, I called down to the front desk and asked them to send someone up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The nice dudes from downstairs came right up and he listened to them.  After he got out of my room I locked the door.  It had not been locked before, because I was awake and was just relaxing.  So now I keep it lock, to keep the drunken Russian Bush Pilots out.  That's one of the stereotypes about Africa that I'm happy to leave in the realm of popular culture.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now that I'm here in S-land am becoming addicted to web content.  Frontline has all of their documentaries up.  Another great site I've found is: &lt;a href="http://freedocumentaries.org">http://freedocumentaries.org&lt;/a> which has tons of documentaries available for downloading.  Not sure the quality as I've been downloading other things, but will get to some of these documentaries soon.&lt;/p>

guess I’m settled in here now.  I am living in a hotel suite for the time&lt;br>
being.  In maybe six weeks or so I’ll move either into a villa on the&lt;br>
grounds of this hotel or have been talking to a few people here about the&lt;br>
possibility of getting a compound like we had when I was in Salone.  Either&lt;br>
way, the living is pretty decent. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>My suite has a TV with&lt;br>
satellite connection (CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera English and some Dubai channels that&lt;br>
show movies in English and a sports channel that has soccer on a lot), sitting&lt;br>
room  with fridge, a bedroom with a big bed (hard as a rock) and a desk&lt;br>
for me to do some work on. &lt;br>
The hotel is a fairly big&lt;br>
compound and I think I’m able to put human smuggling as a room charge, since I&lt;br>
seem to be able to charge everything else on my room!  There is a restaurant&lt;br>
and a little convenience store where I can get a few supplies.  All&lt;br>
chargeable to my room.  There is wireless internet, although it seems to&lt;br>
come and go.  The water runs and the&lt;br>
electricity seems fairly constant without a loud generator.  So I’m in the&lt;br>
lap of luxury! &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sort of.   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The town is very poor.  I&lt;br>
told Highlands that it is like Freetown without the natural beauty.  It&lt;br>
is sort of in a bowl, surrounded by smallish hills on all sides.  My hotel&lt;br>
sits on one of them and I have a great view of the town.  The surroundings&lt;br>
are very much like when I was in 29 Palms, desert.  Although here it has&lt;br>
rained most days and is a bit cooler than in 29 Palms, and here it is a bit&lt;br>
flatter than it was in Cali.  The infrastructure in the town is somewhat&lt;br>
better than Freetown, at least here most have running water and&lt;br>
electricity.  Some people even have cable TV.  The roads are worse, most are dirt and the few that are&lt;br>
paved are riddled with pot holes.  Luckily we have a Land Cruiser with&lt;br>
good suspension and a driver who has a lead foot (for once that wasn’t sarcasm,&lt;br>
I actually like him to drive faster on the roads b/c we miss many of the&lt;br>
bumps). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is very little to do,&lt;br>
unfortunately.  We went to an NGO/UN party last night, but left at 1130&lt;br>
and were harassed at five checkpoints on the way back.  The police&lt;br>
couldn’t fathom that we would want to be out that late!  So, there may be&lt;br>
some cultural growing to do.  Maybe I’ll do it at the local theater that I&lt;br>
drove by today on my way to the market!  Guess I’m going to get my fill of&lt;br>
reading, writing and working until Highlands gets here, and likely&lt;br>
afterwards. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The people seem very&lt;br>
relaxed.  They actually seem to like that I’m American.  It is an odd&lt;br>
feeling.  They are much less aggressive and much more reserved than the&lt;br>
West Africans (from what I’ve seen).  Today I went to the market to get&lt;br>
some coffee and some veggies and was only asked for money once (by an old lady&lt;br>
who had polio).  In Freetown I would have been asked at least 10,000 times&lt;br>
for money.  They are also less gregarious and a bit harder to joke&lt;br>
with.  We’ll see, I need to figure out what makes them tick before I am&lt;br>
able to really develop a rapport with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My partner is nice.  From&lt;br>
what I can tell he and I are getting along.  At the party last night I&lt;br>
started to meet some in the local NGO/UN community.  It is extraordinarily&lt;br>
small, all things considered.  But they all seemed like the others&lt;br>
I met in West Africa.  I guess it takes a weirdo mind to get into this&lt;br>
work and stay in it.  At least at the party there was a bit of beer.&lt;br>
It is a dry country!!!!! &lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, there is the good&lt;br>
and the bad, but I’m OK.  Once I get my feet under me I’ll be able to&lt;br>
really assess whether I like it here, whether I like this work, etc.  But&lt;br>
for now I’m happy and healthy, which is all I can ask for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In case you were looking for pictures, I cannot&lt;br>
provide them!  My camera has either been appropriated by some customs&lt;br>
official along the way or was left behind for some insane reason.  Luckily&lt;br>
I had recently cleaned off the card!  Not to fret, my graduation splurge&lt;br>
for myself is going to be a nice DSLR that I will try to have someone get for&lt;br>
me and ship over in a month or two.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Energy costs, rather than environmental concerns, have been the main&lt;br>
deterrent to desalination plant expansion. Zander said the NRC panel&lt;br>
convened with expectations that technological improvements could lower&lt;br>
the cost of desalination, but they found that the technology is nearly&lt;br>
as efficient as possible at present. The most a plant can reduce its&lt;br>
energy consumption is 15 percent, the report predicts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I’m not a McCain supporter.  However, I am very very pleased that he was able to secure the Republican nomination.  The backstory is linked to above, but the letter below is prima facie evidence of McCain’s class as a human.  It is shit like this that I highly respect.  Very Well Done Mr. Senator.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dear Chairman Daves,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the beginning of this election, I have been committed to running a&lt;br>
respectful campaign based upon an honest debate about the great issues&lt;br>
confronting America today. I expect all state parties to do so as well.&lt;br>
The television advertisement you are planning to air degrades our&lt;br>
civics and distracts us from the very real differences we have with the&lt;br>
Democrats. In the strongest terms, I implore you to not run this&lt;br>
advertisement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This ad does not live up to the very high standards we should hold&lt;br>
ourselves to in this campaign. We need to run a campaign that is worthy&lt;br>
of the people we seek to serve. There is no doubt that we will draw&lt;br>
sharp contrasts with the Democrats on fundamental issues critical to&lt;br>
the future course of our country. But we need not engage in political&lt;br>
tactics that only seek to divide the American people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once again, it is imperative that you withdraw this offensive advertisement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>John McCain&lt;/p>

&lt;p>NYT profiles the best political commentator on television.  I once saw him point to this big map and circle a part of Florida and say something akin to: &amp;ldquo;This part of Florida right here, just south of Orlando is the home to the Non-Mexican, Non-Puerto Rican Latin population in Florida.&amp;rdquo;  Who the hell knows that?  I rifled quickly through my mental database and could find no evidence, even after growing up in Orlando, to contradict that. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And he does that with every state that he commentates on. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good win for HRC tonight.  Congrats.  One of the CNN guys said it best, &amp;ldquo;this is the best number to keep this campaign going.  Any more and she would have blown him out and the supers would mass migrate to her.  Any less and she would have been forced out. &amp;quot; &lt;br>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When a presidential debate in a nation roiled by two wars, an economic&lt;br>

&lt;p>While in the Marines, Vietnam loomed as the most important historical, cultural, and tactical benchmark.  We all felt that it was the closest &amp;ldquo;real war,&amp;rdquo; and although we valued those who had shot or been shot at at various time since such as GWI, Somalia, Liberia, etc. we kept real heroic thoughts for those who fought in Vietnam and (of course) in Korea and WWII. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>After I saw the tiny bit of combat that I did see &amp;ldquo;liberals&amp;rdquo; (as I used to call what now I call &amp;ldquo;us&amp;rdquo;) were adamant that Iraq was going to become the Vietnam of our generation.  I discounted that notion then.  But have been revisiting it mentally lately.  I will have to write in more detail about this at some other point, but it seems to me that the shadow of Vietnam has created another Vietnam.  In other words it is the fear of being judged as harshly as history judges Vietnam  which created the policy conditions that set us on the path we currently find ourselves. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>One small snippet (there are others) which I use only to illustrate my line of thinking:  much of the historical rhetoric on Vietnam has held that the civilians in DC kept too tight a leash on Westmoreland and as they constantly ratchetted up and down the military strategy the folks on the ground (both Vietnamese and US) were not able to adapt quickly enough and the changes in military strategy were never allowed to develop before they were changed again.  The lesson which I was taught more times than I can count is that if &lt;em>only the politicians had listened to the generals&lt;/em> then things wouldn’t have been messed up long term.  That lesson is good, but when taken to an extreme, maybe not.  Now we have conditions established that essentially mandate that when a general speaks no one should even question him.  Generals are inspired, intelligent, sophisticated technocrats.  They are not generalists.  Their focus is not wide-spectrum policies.  Even if they have interests in that realm, it isn’t usually their job (random king-like post-WWII occurrences aside).  They are &amp;amp; should be focussed on winning the battle on the ground.  The completely myopic focus from day negative one until today on &amp;ldquo;winning&amp;rdquo; in Iraq and how that can be done militarily has created a policy environment where state institution building has taken a second- third- or fourth-seat at conference tables which synchronize US policy.   &lt;a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080501faessay87305/steven-simon/the-price-of-the-surge.html">Many&lt;/a> are only NOW beginning to argue  (although I remember thinking unsophisticated versions of this thought when I was in Baghdad afterglowing from pulling down the statute) that it is precisely this lack of focus on domestic political and bureaucratic institutions that is widely responsible for the ongoing violence in Iraq. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is more here, but between trying to move, trying to move to Somalia, applying for the bar, finishing up my spring semester, and trying to look good for my lady I do not have time to fully explore this, but if I expanded it into a book I would title it: *Misguided by History: The Lessons NeoCons Learned Wrongly from Vietnam.  *&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before leaving, I need to point out that I am heartily uncomfortable with the Sunni Awakening as a policy measure.  When Big-Perm first told me that about it and how it had been the focus of his civil affairs work in the second half of 2007 in Anbar I was concerned.  The more I read about it, the more my concern grows.  My concerns essentially hinge on the US arming and empowering those who have very little stake in keeping a cohesive state.  For instance, from the article above:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Sunni sheiks, meanwhile, are getting rich from the surge. The United States has budgeted $150 million to pay Sunni tribal groups this year, and the sheiks take as much as 20 percent of every payment to a former insurgent — which means that commanding 200 fighters can be worth well over a hundred thousand dollars a year for a tribal chief.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Whenever we do decide to leave, if those incentives still exist then chaos at a maximum and violence at a minimum will be a direct result of our short-sided efforts to reduce US casaulties.  What needs to happen is that we need to take away the incentives to breed chaos and violence.  I’m not sure how that happens, but that is a question for Ambassador Cocker, not for the widely regarded General Petraeus.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/world/asia/28tibet.html?ref=world">Tibetan protests&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2008/03/26/protests-rightly-focus-on-the-olympic-games.php">crackdown by the Chinese&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bal-ed.olympics27mar27,0,6054956.story">backlashes from civil societies&lt;/a> around the world offer me a good opportunity to explore differing viewpoints.  Essentially, I know so little of what is going on there that I hesitate to offer comments.  But the link above struck me because it is very counter–philosophy. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like going to &lt;a href="http://www.globalvoicesonline.org/">Global Voices &lt;/a>because they usually have excellent links to interesting prose and other voices.  So running an article about how the Chinese Bloggers are defending their government and deriding the poor, peaceful Tibetan protesters who only want to get on with their Buddhist meditations adds an interesting twist to my thinking.  Of course there are many sides to this story.  Duh. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I associate Free Tibet Movement with other early 90s civil society ideas (which seemed to fail or remain stagnant more often than &amp;ldquo;succeed&amp;rdquo; however that could be measured) such as Save the Whales and Save the Rainforest and End Apartheid.  My concept of the situation is shaped from voyeuristic understanding of the situation.  I am more focussed on poverty and Africa rather than self-determination and Asia.  At the end of the day, the Free Tibet movement is off my radar screen.  That said I still find it fascinating. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Global Voices piece could simply be exposing Chinese Government surrogates who &amp;ldquo;blog&amp;rdquo; neutrally, or it could be proffering a different view on the situation.  I know not which it is, but still love the fact that it has added an additional, nuanced layer to the debate.  Hopefully to the betterment of the Movement. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the Movement takes this as an attack on its existence rather than an opportunity to engage in a good debate about what it is doing than I challenge it to stop playing by a conservative dichotomized playbook and join the pomo crowd who makes up much of its membership (I suspect).&lt;/p>

for Barack.  I truly hope that his speech tomorrow on Iraq and his&lt;br>
speech the next day on the economy (with its linkages to Iraq) will be&lt;br>
as complex as this one.  This speech, I admit, was not full of&lt;br>
solutions.  It was a world-view dissertation.  For a long time I have&lt;br>
argued that the &amp;ldquo;Barack is vacuous&amp;rdquo;  line is complete intellectual&lt;br>
dishonesty.  I am excited for him to shine. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I have two reactions that (hopefully) are not completely informed by the massive amounts of punditry that I’ve read since watching the speech.  People will likely dissect the speech in every shape and form.  I actually have little to say that will likely be unique about the content of his speech and prefer to analyze it at a pomo remove. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Point 1:  I am struck that &lt;a href="http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-tb.cgi/20061">Barack wrote this alone&lt;/a> and it was not a collaborative effort.  On the one hand I am hesitant to endorse someone who keeps his own company, especially someone who is managing one of the most complex organizations in the world and will never have a complete handle on the issues and the facts and will be reliant on others to distill what is important because there simply is not enough seconds in the day to be able to grab everything.  Too closehold of a management style is disadvantageous in the political spectrum.  Yet on the other hand, the President (though the &amp;ldquo;face&amp;rdquo;) needs to be able to have solidly held beliefs that are formed by a distinctive world view.  Too little of an idea about what one’s views are can be detrimental.  Clinton was magical at being a complete vacuum of world view and basing many decisions upon short-term political gains.  The gist of the Republican argument since the Clinton administration is that they hold to their beliefs and do not shift with the winds of the moment.  Barack seems willing to say anything you can do, I can do….better (he would argue).  Although there is a fine line here, I would prefer to have a President that does not change with the winds of the moment and is willing to keep his own company as long as he is open to dissent and flexible enough to know when to change.  It is like the old christian poem which ends with the &amp;ldquo;wisdom to know the difference.&amp;rdquo; This is where the trust of politics comes into play (trust, I would argue is one of the major normative bases for identity politics which is as unavoidable in modern America as it was in the recent &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/magazine/23kenya-t.html?ex=1356066000&amp;amp;en=c558476ab344449e&amp;amp;ei=5124&amp;amp;partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink">Kenyan elections&lt;/a>).   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>More important, intellectually, than the trust factor (to me), is that Obama is willing to buck the political trend when he feels strongly about an issue.  There was no polling to help refine his views on this issue.  He did not need that.  He has experienced things acutely in his short life that resonate with both of my major iterations.  His expose about white frustration at affirmative action and urban crime were very much how I’ve thought at times in my life.  His discussion of black anger because of a history which has seemed to pit the world against the black community is very much in line with my current views after talking to those who have studied education much more in depth than I have.  Both of these resonated with me in a very real and powerful way.  But yet, he did not need to have some whites and blacks on a committee to tell him their stories.  His story is incredibly unique in that he intimately understands both of these major sides to the coin without having to rely on someone to tell him &amp;ldquo;what the American people think.&amp;rdquo;  Yes, obviously there is a danger here because a politician should &lt;em>never&lt;/em> close off inputs, dissent and alternate world views.  No one that I’ve heard has made that claim against Barack so I am comfortable that an Obama administration would not be closed off.  Yet it seems to be principled in a way that other campaigns likely will not be, precisely because he is able to relate in a way that most intellectuals and elites cannot. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was sitting at my computer watching this on YouTube, I closed my eyes and just listened to the speech and thought, &amp;ldquo;Damn, if we can elect this man I can be publicly proud to be an American again….No matter if I’m in Somalia or Sierra Leone or Holland or Scotland or Chattanooga.&amp;rdquo;  In my opinion, THAT is why we elect a President.  Sure there are policy stances and we want the government to be receptive to our concerns.  Those are supremely important, but for me, that is what I base my legislative voting decisions upon.  Presidential decisions present me with an entirely different calculus because the President has a fundamentally different job.  I’m sure that any of the three candidates will do things that I agree and disagree with, but which one of them will make me proudly tell people I’m American and not make me want to tell people I’m Canadian when I travel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Point 2:  I think that there will likely be continued rumblings about the complexity of the speech and people will likely argue that it is only going to be accessible to elites and that mainstream America will not be affected by this speech.  That is true if mainstream America does not watch and listen to the speech and actually reflect on the truthiness of what Barack is saying.  But there is nothing that stood out to me as particularly complex or inaccessible about what he was saying.  I have been continually annoyed over the years at the lack of complexity in political discourse.  Many have written books on the dumbing of America.  Go to Amazon and I’m sure that you will find hundreds.  I like Obama not so much because I agree with his message (although that obviously helps) but more because I respect his willingness to engage in complex dialogue with his supporters and detractors alike. Culturally I agree with those who decry the lack of complex political debate and I become concerned as to how long our &amp;ldquo;greatness&amp;rdquo; (whatever that is) will be sustainable if we continue to patronize people rather than force them to think critically about issues and form their own opinions.I think that changes in media dissemination (mainly meaning the internet, etc.) both help and hurt. Although there is increased access to something like a major policy speech by a candidate, there is also increased shrillness both for and against it and thinly veiled for and against coverage. The point is not that technology has helped or hurt our culture, it is that if there is a continued cultural reliance upon other’s analysis rather than source-level inquiries and critical thinking then I question where we shall end up. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>To bring the argument back around on itself (hopefully without being circular), this is precisely what Obama does in this speech.  He has formed his own opinions based upon his experiences and his understanding of the facts that do not come across as colored and polished in the same way that most others (black or white) would come across giving a similar speech.  He talked for 40 minutes straight and rarely looked at any notes, yet was eloquent in a way that made me believe that he truly understood what he was saying.  I feel (no matter whether it is true or not) that he had formed those opinions himself based on his thought and not Mark Penn telling him what the American people want to hear. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intellect should not be a dirty word and critical thought is not&lt;br>
something that people in small liberal arts colleges engage in over&lt;br>
hipster beers or free-trade coffee.  Critical thought simply means&lt;br>
forming your own opinions on matters based upon a reading of the facts&lt;br>
as you think they exist.  Yet, these seem to be dirty words.  Not sure,&lt;br>
but, like I always say, I’m all about Dirty Deeds, Done Dirt Cheap. &lt;/p>

[No Longer in Race, Richardson Is a Man Pursued][2].  It isn’t a secret that before he dropped out, I was hoping that Bill Richardson would make a good showing.  Now that he is out of the race (no pun intended), I have been wondering whether he would be attractive to the candidates, and if he was in what regard. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Seems that both candidates are courting him.  Not sure to what extent they are lobbying for his endorsement, for his superdelegate vote, or for him to be a running mate or cabinet level position (Sec State most likely). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I, and to a certain extent, Big_Head have been lusting after an Obama – Richardson Ticket for about a year now (or, alternatively a Richardson – Obama ticket).  This would make much sense for Obama.  In my mind it would make more sense than the Obama – Clinton &amp;ldquo;dream ticket&amp;rdquo; that many pundits speak of.  In the Obama – Clinton situation, you get all of the policies that are essentially the same.  You get experiences that are not that different.  And, most importantly, you get no additional bonuses (Clinton supporters are HIGHLY unlikely to not support Barack) with a bunch of turnoffs (all the moderates who have been known for a time to be anti-Hillary. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>An Obama – Richardson ticket would seem to me to present the opposite.  No one seems to be anti-Bill in the way that many moderates and conservatives.  There seems to be a contingent of conservatives that are likely to migrate to Barack if they are suitably anti-McCain…which, BTW, I don’t really understand but have heard many tell me personally that they would migrate Barack’s way now that John is the Republican nominee.  Further, Richardson can ADD to Obama’s base if he was on the ticket in the way that Clinton would not really be able to add. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clinton holds a very partisan Democratic base who I do not see migrating away if Barack is the candidate.  Clinton’s base has never been noted to be moderates.  Barack has been winning those since Iowa, and has continued to.  Richardson brings experiences that will bolster the ticket (especially in the foreign policy realm where I would admit Barack appears to me to be a bit weaker than McCain).  Richardson also will be able to identify with Hispanic moderates and help Barack win that HUGE vote in the general.  Hillary has done OK with the Latin vote to date, but I do not see it being the same without the identity politics that would come into play if Richardson was the running mate. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we’ll have to see how it plays out.  All of this is (obviously) predicated on Barack pulling it out March 4 and afterwards.  I think that is increasingly going to be realized.  But, again, we never know!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Iraq matters – a lot to voters.  But Iraq shouldn’t matter.  No matter what the candidates say to pander to their base each of them is going to do virtually identical things on Iraq.  Iraq is complicated, but it isn’t that complicated.  We know what we need to do now, that is clear.  Despite pleas to &amp;ldquo;End the War&amp;rdquo; that is essentially an ephemeral campaign promise. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sweet.  We’re going to the Situation Room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Iraqmap_2][2]][2]&lt;br>
Anyway.  The reason that they will all do the same thing but be able to say completely different things is because of the nuances.  They are simply talking the nuances, but this is how it will most likely play out. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.theglobaleducationproject.org/mideast/info/maps/iraq-map.gif">http://www.theglobaleducationproject.org/mideast/info/maps/iraq-map.gif&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a terrorist threat in Iraq.  We knew that the time that they would be coming for us.  To me, at the time when we were invading this was the most convincing argument.  I’ve said before, I’ll say again that although it doesn’t really justify the war in my mind, at least I was happy to go there to provide the fly trap. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, I have problems with that, because whereever there is fighting there is collateral damage and now Sunnis in Western Iraq are paying the price for the neocon idea of better over there than here. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that there is a terrorist threat, we need to keep fighting them there.  Al Qaeda is sending its best fighters into the loosely populated areas of Western Iraq.  Those missions that the young Marines are carrying out in the western deserts are vital to our national security, because those fighters do have backing that enables a long enough reach to threaten vital interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the point that Republicans play up and Democrats gloss over.  Neither Obama nor Hillary nor McCain nor anyone (except maybe Ron Paul) is going to stop the terrorist hunting missions in the West. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Baghdad.  Located in the virtual geographic center of the country Baghdad is a conundrum.  It is as close as a melting pot as Iraq has, and certainly one of the more cosmopolitan centers east of Jordan.  What happens there is connected to what is happening in the West, but only loosely.  They inform one another, but there is little tight causal connection.  What is happening in Baghdad is tribal tensions that have built up over millennium colliding with the realities of politics colliding with patronage networks that require bolstering or maintenance.  The issues there are raw political ones that happen in any post-conflict scenario. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the bombings are to get power in the parliament; some of the bombings are organized crime who is fighting other organized crime for territory; some of the bombings are terrorist and ideological based; and I’m sure that other bombings are the same.  So not all the bombs that get reported are the same.  Yes, the bombings have reduced.  That is because the surge is working.  At least it is working in Baghdad, where it needed to work because that is the center of gravity for Iraq and it must retain some modicum of stability if Iraq is going to be able to figure out how to solve its other problems.  Rumsfeld was just as wrong as he was right.  A small elite force could topple Saddam’s regime.  We did it beautifully.  But without any planning, without enough troops, without sufficient oversight of general’s things soon spiraled out of control.  The only way to regain momentum and control in Baghdad was to flood the streets with soldiers.  That reduces the capability of insurgents and organized crime and backhanded, violent political operative’s ability to operate.  This is what is causing the reduction in violence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution here must be resolved by the Iraqis.  They need to be forced into political reconciliation.  They need to be forced into policing organized crime.  They need to take the lead on rooting out the insurgents that escape our corridor around the Western Desert area.  We need to help them in all this, but this has to Iraqi driven, the US can only do so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the aspect of Iraq that the Democrats play up and the Republicans glaze over.  Both parties are going to keep significant numbers of troops in Baghdad for a set period of time and then force the Iraqis into figuring it out.  At the end of this set period we are going to begin to draw down our troop structure.  When Iraqis begin taking over Baghdad we will see significant reductions in troop strengths.  But no one is going to pull the Marines out of western Iraq.  Not for a while yet. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of Iraq.  The rest of Iraq is just as nuanced.  Drugs, Crime, Terrorists, all of these will seep across the borders, making it easier for them to come to Europe.  The Europeans don’t want that.  We don’t want that.  The provincial solution is to help the Iraqi’s secure their borders.  We are doing this to a certain extent and for the most part will continue to do this.  I see little change here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So at the end of the day Cut And Run = 100 Years in Iraq = Retreat in Defeat.  At the end of the day they are all realists and are all going to do the same thing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wonk Out</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-02-06-wonk-out/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2008/2008-02-06-wonk-out/</guid><description>&lt;p>[![Benazirbhuttocfr][2]][2]&lt;br>

This is what the creator said about this video.  I’m not an artist, I do other things, but I agree with almost everything he says.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I was sitting in my recording studio watching the debates…&lt;br>
Torn between the candidates&lt;br>
I was never really big on politics…&lt;br>
and actually I’m still not big on politics…&lt;br>
but 4 years ago, me and the black eyed peas supported Kerry…&lt;br>
And we supported Kerry with all our might…&lt;br>
We performed and performed and performed for the DNC…&lt;br>
doing all we could do to get the youth involved…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The outcome of the last 2 elections has saddened me…&lt;br>
on how unfair, backwards, upside down, unbalanced, untruthful,&lt;br>
corrupt, and just simply, how wrong the world and &amp;ldquo;politics&amp;rdquo; are…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this year i wanted to get involved and do all i could early…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And i found myself torn…&lt;br>
because this time it’s not that simple…&lt;br>
our choices aren’t as clear as the last elections …&lt;br>
last time it was so obvious…&lt;br>
Bush and war vs. no bush and no war…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this time it’s not that simple…&lt;br>
and there are a lot of people that are torn just like i am…&lt;br>
So for awhile I put it off and i was going to wait until it was decided for me…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then came New Hampshire…&lt;br>
And i was captivated…&lt;br>
Inspired…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reflected on my life…&lt;br>
and the blessings I have…&lt;br>
and the people who fought for me to have these rights and blessings…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and I’m not talking about a &amp;ldquo;black thing&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
I’m talking about a &amp;ldquo;human thing&amp;rdquo; me as a &amp;ldquo;person&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
an American…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That speech made me think of Martin Luther King…&lt;br>
Kennedy…&lt;br>
and Lincoln…&lt;br>
and all the others that have fought for what we have today…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>what America is &amp;ldquo;supposed&amp;rdquo; to be…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>freedom…&lt;br>
equality…&lt;br>
and truth…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and thats not what we have today…&lt;br>
we think we are free…&lt;br>
but in reality terror and fear controls our decisions…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this is not the America that our pioneers and leaders fought and&lt;br>
died for…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and then there was New Hampshire&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it was that speech…&lt;br>
like many great speeches…&lt;br>
that one moved me…&lt;br>
because words and ideas are powerful…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It made me think…&lt;br>
and realize that today we have &amp;ldquo;very few&amp;rdquo; leaders…&lt;br>
maybe none…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but that speech…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it inspired me…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it inspired me to look inside myself and outwards towards the world…&lt;br>
it inspired me to want to change myself to better the world…&lt;br>
and take a &amp;ldquo;leap&amp;rdquo; towards change…&lt;br>
and hope that others become inspired to do the same…&lt;br>
change themselves..&lt;br>
change their greed…&lt;br>
change their fears…&lt;br>
and if we &amp;ldquo;change that&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;then hey&amp;rdquo;..&lt;br>
we got something right…???…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1 week later after the speech settled in me…&lt;br>
I began making this song…&lt;br>
I came up with the idea to turn his speech into a song…&lt;br>
because that speech effected and touched my inner core like nothing in a very long time…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it spoke to me…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>because words and ideas are powerful…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just wanted to add a melody to those words…&lt;br>
I wanted the inspiration that was bubbling inside me to take over…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so i let it..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wasn’t afraid to stand for something…&lt;br>
to stand for &amp;ldquo;change&amp;rdquo;…&lt;br>
I wasn’t afraid of &amp;ldquo;fear&amp;rdquo;…&lt;br>
it was pure inspiration…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so I called my friends…&lt;br>
and they called their friends…&lt;br>
in a matter of 2 days…&lt;br>
We made the song and video…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Usually this process would take months…&lt;br>
a bunch of record company people figuring out strategies and release dates…&lt;br>
interviews…&lt;br>
all that stuff…&lt;br>
but this time i took it in my own hands…&lt;br>
so i called my friends sarah pantera, mike jurkovac, fred goldring, and jesse dylan to help make it happen…&lt;br>
and they called their friends..&lt;br>
and we did it together in 48 hours…&lt;br>
and instead of putting it in the hands of profit we put it in the hands of inspiration…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then we put it on the net for the world to feel…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are truly inspired..&lt;br>
magic happens…&lt;br>
incredible things happen…&lt;br>
love happens..&lt;br>
(and with that combination)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;love, and inspiration&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>change happens…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;change for the better&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
Inspiration breeds change…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Positive change&amp;rdquo;…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no one on this planet is truly experienced to handle the obstacles we face today…&lt;br>
Terror, fear, lies, agendas, politics, money, all the above…&lt;br>
It’s all scary…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Martin Luther King didn’t have experience to lead…&lt;br>
Kennedy didn’t have experience to lead…&lt;br>
Susan B. Anthony…&lt;br>
Nelson Mandella…&lt;br>
Rosa Parks…&lt;br>
Gandhi…&lt;br>
Anne Frank…&lt;br>
and everyone else who has had a hand in molding the freedoms we have and take for granted today…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no one truly has experience to deal with the world today…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>they just need &amp;ldquo;desire, strength, courage ability, and passion&amp;rdquo; to change…&lt;br>
and to stand for something even when people say it’s not possible…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>America would not be here &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; if we didn’t stand and fight for&lt;br>
change &amp;ldquo;yesterday&amp;rdquo;…&lt;br>
Everything we have as a &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; is because of the &amp;ldquo;people&amp;rdquo; who fought for&lt;br>
change…&lt;br>
and whoever is the President has to realize we have a lot of changing to do&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m not trying to convince people to see things how i do…&lt;br>
I produced this song to share my new found inspiration and how I’ve been moved…&lt;br>
I hope this song will make you feel…&lt;br>
love…&lt;br>
and think…&lt;br>
and be inspired just like the speech inspired me…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that’s all…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s all come together like America is supposed to…&lt;br>
Like Japan did after Hiroshima…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that was less than 65 years ago…&lt;br>
and look at Japan now…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>they did it together…&lt;br>
they did it…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;We can’t?…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are you serious..?..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>WE CAN!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes we can…&lt;br>
A United &amp;ldquo;America&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>
Democrats, Republicans and Independents together…&lt;br>
Building a new America&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can do it…&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;TOGETHER&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is the original speech which inspired the song, it is art in its own right.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Both candidates showed off the intricacies of their handle on the policy.  Both candidates were eloquent, prepared and insightful. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won’t cry if Hillary wins.  And, BTW, I won’t threaten to move to Canada if McCain wins as on my major issues of international reengagement and the environment they are all three virtually in alignment.  Although I worry about what McCain will do to the Supreme Court when Stevens or RBG croaks and that that will have long term deleterious effects for our country.  Even if you are a conservative you must know that will not be good for the country. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, I was inspired by Barak; I was reassured that he can be wonkish plus still give me optimism.  For calling myself a progressive, I’ve come around slowly on Barak due to concerns about this issue, but also just because it is difficult to believe. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>For so much of my life politicians have been somethings that really haven’t impacted on my life, and if they have it has not be positive.  I feel disenfranchised from the entire process.  While Big_Head has been in love with political process for a while, I’ve come around slowly.  It has taken this election to engage me.  Now I pray at the alter of John King’s bibliographical mind and crazy hands on that freaking board on CNN that I love. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But more than that I’ve come around to believe.  To really want someone to win, not just shrug my shoulders, and certainly not shake my head. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that when people get passionate about politics, especially left-wingers, they fail to understand how things really work in Washington.  I think for the most part Barak and Hillary will be able to accomplish very similar things in Washington.  Both will take aggressive stances on progressive issues, and with a Democratic congress will push through some things and will see some other things fail.  Both will do approximately the same thing that McCain will do on Iraq and will likely take very similar foreign policy stances – in reality (no matter what any one says on the trail to pander to their bases).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So on the one hand the problems and solutions are so complex that there is a limiting  mechanism that kicks in after inauguration.  I am interested when people really debate what a President’s position is on many of these issues, as if the Executive didn’t have to go to Congress.  Most of what is being talked about in the debates, no matter who wins, is going to have to get pushed through Congress.  It is not like if Hillary wins we get universal healthcare the next day.  The President can only do so much on domestic issues.  That aside.  At the end of the day, for me, their relative collapse on the issues cuts towards Obama. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure there is the thing about Hillary and the war, and maybe that will resonate with some people, especially core partisans.  She is getting demolished by the press for the answer she gave about Iraq.  But those people are playing partisan politics via the media.  I thought her answer was straight-forward and honest, it was eloquent, pragmatic and reasoned and I whole heartedly disagree with those people that have been turned off by that answer.  I thought what she said was on point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, that isn’t what I care about.  I care about hope.  And I feel that I’ve found it in Obama.  I’m engaged, and, for once, I’m optimistic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is much more analysis in my head but this should suffice for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the dem’s debate finished, I kept flipping through my Gazillion channels to find more punditry as John King was cut off too quickly for my likes.  Flipped through CSPAN, and there was a Senate Foreign Relations Hearing about what the HELL are we going to do in Afghanistan.  It was UTTERLY fascinating!!!!  Afghanistan is so messed up right now.  If you want to know about it, read the Foreignpolicy.com article below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/node/8014" title="It seems Europe is determined to lose in Afghanistan | FP Passport">It seems Europe is determined to lose in Afghanistan&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the major problems that I see occurring time and again is the lack of judicial sector reform.  I think that post-conflict transitions are going to soon be in a place where my aggresive ROL reforms that I’ve been formulating in my head will become international best practices.  We need to train police and judges and prosecutors and defense attorneys better after a country &amp;ldquo;cleans up&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means).  For now that is all I’ll say as I’m still formulating most of the theorem. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tonight in a random occurrence I decided to watch Franti’s I Know I’m Not Alone.  And something became clear to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m may not be peculiarly good at any of the things I have done to date.  But I am peculiarly good at one thing:  blending in.  I know few others that I’ve met that can say their favorite three roles of the (at least 5) lives they’ve led are: Marine, Hippy and Lawyer.  And maybe I’m one of the few that can talk to the Marines, the Hippies in a way that will really affect things for a lot of people. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I guess that, in a way, she was right.  Maybe, I do LIKE going places I may not come home from, and here is why.  To them, that *IS *home.  Can you imagine that?  I can.  And that is why I have to go, to talk to the Marines, to talk to the Hippies and to talk to the Lawyers.  Get those people to agree and there is a powerful force to turn their homes into something that feels as wonderful to them as your home feels to you.  Who is going to help give them back their homes so their Mom’s can worry about them like mine worries about me?  Only those who can bridge gaps.  And if I have a talent it is likely to be that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mom, don’t worry.  I’ll come home to you.  But only after I help some others find their’s.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I know that it is trendy in the UK to bash on Gordon Brown.  I agree with his critics, mostly.  However this Guardian article points out what things he does seem to get entirely correct. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two particular things that I like about his stance:  (1) his willingness to open up the power structure to a few more voices in recognition of their growing importance; (2) his (apparent) understanding of the intricacies of post-conflict transitions. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the first point.  It seems to me that the time is coming where it is unavoidable that the &amp;ldquo;winners&amp;rdquo; in WWII are going to have to cede some of their relative monopoly on power.  This will create a shift in international politics as the center of gravity shifts from somewhere around the mid-Atlantic to somewhere else.  Brown is lobby for India, Brazil, Germany, Japan and an African State to be named later to get permanent seats on the Security Council.  Realists in America and Russia have resisted this and it is likely that they will continue to resist, at least through the end of the Bush administration which seems to understand little about the world outside of their mansions.  But it will be interesting to see if we can get an administration into the White House with a different notion of international politics how it will play out.  An arrangement such as this will complicate negotiations when action needs to be streamlined and quick, but I think that the SC is fairly impotent as it is and the addition of a few voices and the recognition that moving forward we need to integrate these voices (on top of the addition of Germany and Japan will put to bed much of the WWII winners/losers stuff) into the discussion outweighs additional difficulties in negotiations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the second point.  I have been thinking for a while about a task force to go in under a UN mandate that is more than only delegations from DPKO to help in post-conflict transitions.  I have been wondering, essentially, why this hasn’t happened, because to my ignorant eyes it seems like a fantastic po-mo solution.  Brown’s idea is this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Today, on the final day of his tour of India and China, Brown will&lt;br>
announce plans for a UN crisis prevention and recovery fund, worth&lt;br>
$200m (£102m), which would put judges, police and fire service staff on&lt;br>
standby to support countries immediately as they come out of conflict.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And I think that it is very forward thinking.  Sovereignists will likely argue that it is and internationalization of the rule of law and essential services that will take away too much authority from the state and propagate brain-drain and a welfare culture among developing countries.  Done wrongly, they are right.  However, done correctly they could be wrong.  We are seeing in Kenya now that much of the violence (although tribal based) is based upon land redistribution issues.  Sending in a small team of judges to rule ON KENYAN law, but untainted by tribal allegiances may be able to make a huge positive contribution to resolution of the core problems which are causing the violence.  The teams must be careful  when establishing their mandates as I see a big difference in sending judges in to rule on land redistribution issues and meddling in something completely politicized (like the legitimacy of the election results).  Something of this magnitude will have other effects such as politicizing decisions of when do they  go into a country, what do they do, etc.  But the hopes of cross-cultural experience and cultivation of institutions may outweigh the downsides in my mind.&lt;/p>

I remember one time when Evergreen and I were in the Marine Corps.  He was so tired and it was so dark outside that he heated up a bag of peanut butter to put in his cheese ravioli bag of treats.  It was so disgusting that he had to go hungry or eat it, considering the circumstances (we were on one meal a day for the exercise and all exhausted and constantly hungry) he ate it, but I will always remember the look on his face when he turned to me and said in his Texas draw, &amp;ldquo;Casey, put this one in your toolkit, always check if the bag is peanut butter or cheese cause if you get this one wrong it’ll costya.&amp;rdquo;  The story is mainly funny to me because of the look of utter destituteness that was on Evergreen’s face when he took that first bite and embarked on the slow realization of what had happened to him, and the realization was slow because of how absolutely exhausted and hungry we all were after a long night of patrolling or whatever we had been doing all we wanted to do was sit down and have a bit of a meal before we started the next day (all this happened just before dawn) of the same grueling stuff.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>So now, I give you all one.  Never freeze the European Captain, because unlike American Captain, it freezes.  Not really sure why, but it does.  I am neither hungry, nor thirsty, nor exhausted, nor destitute like Evergreen was in that story, so maybe this isn’t terrible funny, but it IS informative and gives me an excuse to pose a picture of the good Captain.&lt;/p>

It seems, to me, that the other thing that is happening is that it keeps my bookmarks clean.  Anally retentive people’s ears perk up at this.  I can just go to mySpace and find out about organizations rather than having to open each in a separate tab in my firefox browser (i find it amusing that the firefox browser tags itself as a misspelled word). 
Have just seen the MySpace Impact Awards.  Apparently MySpace gives these away every quarter, or month or something.  It is a $10k grant, but more importantly (for most organizations) is the free advertising that MySpace will deliver to its 40Zillion users.  The criteria for winning are supposedly:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Committee will select three (3) finalists from all entries eligible&lt;br>
for the Grand Prize that are received during the Contest Submission&lt;br>
Period based on the discretion of each of the judges, based on the&lt;br>
following judging criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):  25% relevance to&lt;br>
the month’s category, 25% use of MySpace toolset to promote the cause&lt;br>
(i.e. good profile design, incorporating multi-media, active engagement&lt;br>
with the MySpace community, etc.), 25% breadth of reach and appeal, and&lt;br>
25% fit with the culture of MySpace.
I included the criteria because it is interesting how subjective it all is.  Hipsters judging hipsters.  Nevertheless.  They have six main categories, they seem to rotate every month or quarter whenever the award is given:

Last week [Jacob Zuma was elected as head of ANC.][2]  He won this election over the sitting president, Thabo Mbeki, who he has had troubles with in the past.  Zuma used to be Mbeki’s vice, but was fired in 2005.  Last week he has wrested the leadership of the ANC from him after a very acrimonious campaign for the leadership of Nelson’s party.  So today, BBC reports that there are rumors that Zuma will be [indicted on corruption charges][3]. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Love of corruption is the root of all evil in my eyes, but I’m conflicted here.  Maybe he did it, in which case then things need to be reevaluated.  Maybe there should be a new election for head of ANC.  But even if he did, and there was a prosecutorial decision in 2005 not to prosecute him, then it just feels like blackmail. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are many interesting political dimensions to this.  One is that South Africa is looked up to throughout most of Africa as the (relative) bastion of good governance (see, e.g., &lt;a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200712200230.html">this&lt;/a>) in the same way that Nigeria is held up as the bastion of what not to do (see, e.g., &lt;a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200712190100.html">this&lt;/a>).  At least for the Anglophone countries this largely appears to be the case.  But South Africa’s importance goes way beyond simply an example, it is THE key to all of Southern Africa, if not most of sub-saharan Africa.  Despite Nigeria’s desires, the key regional powers in the AU from the sub-saharan countries are: well, South Africa, and to a lesser extent Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria. &lt;/p>

The 2010 World Cup is to be held in South Africa and is thought of widely as a way to focus attention on Africa in a very positive light for the first time in a long time.  The entire continent seemingly feels ownership over these games in a way that could not be the case if they were elsewhere – in the developed world.  So, what happens if the next year and a half goes badly politically for South Africa?  The entire continent may suffer from a failed opportunity.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Maybe I’m making more of this than is really here.  If the ANC does implode because of an internal power struggle, maybe that shifts the domestic political dynamics but does not really affect the status of the country.  Like, I say, keep an eye on it. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Posner.  O Posner.  You may be smart, but you certainly are ignorant on many things.  When critiquing something that is internationalized perhaps you should pull your head out of your US only ass and look around the world.  The HDI is not used for anything in the developed world.  It means little to the developed world, because ranking industrialized democracies is only for pride sake.  What is the number 10 country going to do but get laughed at by numbers 1-9.  All of them have a standard of living that is vaguely unapproachable for the citizens of the countries who are ranked (no matter the ranking system) less than 75. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>My favorite part of this piece is graph:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I cannot myself see the value of the Human Development Index. Not that per&lt;br>
capita income, life expectancy at birth, and level of education as proxied by&lt;br>
adult literacy and school enrollments are unimportant; a ranking of each of&lt;br>
these aspects of human development might be a good first step in identifying&lt;br>
areas of weakness that a society might wish to devote additional resources to&lt;br>
improving. It is the combining of the indexes and announcing that the&lt;br>
combination offers a ranking of nations by the degree of their &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo; as&lt;br>
distinct from narrowly defined &amp;ldquo;economic&amp;rdquo; development that strikes me as&lt;br>
dubious, and indeed as senseless. The obvious objection is to the equal&lt;br>
weighting of the three indexes, and to the omission of a host of other important&lt;br>
dimensions of development, such as housing quality, pollution, tax rates, adult&lt;br>
life expectancy, crime rates, unemployment, inflation, quality and variety of&lt;br>
goods and services, economic growth, and quality of education–though including&lt;br>
them would exacerbate the weighting problem, and some involve serious&lt;br>
measurement problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>First let me point out what this vaunted judge and law professor’s major problem with the HDI is: it is the combining of the indexes which troubles this self-proclaimed intellectual.  He goes on to say that he is also troubled about the lack of other factors which could be factored into the overall development index, but all while saying that he does not think that there is a difference between economic development and human development.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of my female friends absolutely detest this man for saying that there is an efficient amount of rape.  His point is fair enough, but does he have to say things in that manner.  I now know how they feel.  This piece absolutely enraged me for its complete lack of ignorance of the world.  It makes me ashamed to have attended law school.  It makes me ashamed to be an American.  Why do we continue to be so god damn ignorant of what lives outside our border? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was hip, in development circles, to criticize the methodology of how the HDI was calculated….five years ago.  (And fair enough, it is also hip in law school to criticize Posner if you are even remotely left leaning.)  But never have I heard it criticized from a uniquely developed country perspective where the critique is essentially for developed countries vis a vis other developed countries the methodology is a failure.  He doesn’t even get into the methodology for how the soft indexes are calculated, and I’m glad because although I’m certain that this extremely smart man could comprehend what was happening that he would have something completely enraging to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, to something else.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This holds vast promise for developing countries which do not require the massive infrastructure realignment that developed countries will require to widely-adopt biofuels.  Yet somehow we keep focusing on internal combustion gas and diesel vehicles for developing country.  It is one thing when there is a welfare relationship.  It is another in the majority of developing countries where there is a mix of new and used vehicles imported.&lt;/p>

think-tank for wonks that don’t want to do real work.  My cynicism&lt;br>
aside, the paper is fantastic.  Titled, The Pentagon and Global Development: Making Sense of the DoD’s Expanding Role, the paper seeks to address some of the good and challenging implications of the current trend in US foreign policy circles.  The Provisional Reconstruction Teams have been held up as an icon of inter-agency coordination and US commitment to rebuilding &amp;ldquo;war-torn&amp;rdquo; countries integrating the good governance best practices developed by aid agencies the world over.  Recently, I have been very intrigued by the idea of &lt;a href="http://www.africom.mil/">AFRICOM.&lt;/a>  I have been wondering how it is all going to play out and what the command will really end up doing.  It is these types of questions which the paper addresses very artfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This paper was a very interesting read since I used to be a Marine, want to be in development and peace building, am American and hope to be able to back up my claims as an internationalist. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a long time now I have questioned what I was hearing coming out of Iraq.  The public debate has been extremely flat.  It began with the rebuilding and stability debate.  Do you wait until there is stability to rebuild?  What happens when the instability was spawned by an appearance of unwillingness to rebuild?  Then for a while it moved to an even more flat debate:  pull out (and risk regional collapse) or stay (for how long and at what cost)?  Although I have to doubt that these were the questions that were being asked in senior circles, and I generally endorse asking simple questions as a backstop, if the debate really was like this behind closed doors I want my tax money back.  The point is that these are very simple questions that present a public with a false dilemma.  I have a hard time believing that these are the only two options.  There are a ton of smart people in this world that work very hard and think long and hard (see supra….) and this is the best that we can come up with? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The discussion in this paper proves that my fears of idiocy at the top are not completely realized.  The military has realized that there is some that they are able to do in not-completely-resolved-security-situations that do not present a simple black and white dichotomy of instability or stability, rebuilding or not. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I was studying to become a Marine Infantry Officer I will forever remember my dad looking me straight in the eyes and telling me that he wasn’t scared about me going to war, what he was scared of was some &amp;ldquo;flaming liberal&amp;rdquo; sending me off to be the world’s policeman.  I wonder now how the idea of doing a simple NEO (non-combatant evacuation operation) in Liberia would appeal if it was a true choice of that or Iraq now?  What currently scares me more than my former colleagues being the world’s policemen (the line between military and police is historically, functionally, and psychologically a thin one) is my former colleagues being the world’s governors.  In November 2005 the President signed DoD Directive 3000.05 integrating &amp;ldquo;Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction Operations&amp;rdquo; as a core mission for the Pentagon. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This frightens me for four reasons: (1) the lack of relative expertise and experience; (2) the right institutional biases for war fighting may be the wrong institutional biases for state building; (3) the instincts that are bred into military commanders are for authoritarian leadership; (4) the (continued) impression that it gives to the rest of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(1) Few will argue with me, and according to the paper even those in the Pentagon wouldn’t argue with the assertion, that the Pentagon is ill-positioned vis a vis State to embark on state building.  The experience of the State is focussed almost exclusively on policy level implications of decisions.  It is where the experts in development trends are kept; it is where those with years of experience in how to integrate the concerns of local populaces with the overriding policy objectives with the systemic constraints are kept.  Although the military is filled with Officers who are used to making decisions based upon a complex matrix of data, and I would be the last to question their intellectual capability, I guarantee that few Officers (even JAGs) in the Pentagon know what the bast practices for administrative capacity support for judicial sector reform will be. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>(2) While I was a Marine I learned a ton of valuable leadership lessons that will be with me for the rest of my life.  Patience was not included in those.  Long-term thinking was not included in those.  Second and third order thinking of unintended consequences through a wide-angle mental lens was not included in those.  Yet these are some of the most integral components for state building.  I remember thinking once that it was ridiculous that it took us three months to build up in Kuwait before going into Iraq.  Part of it was pre-combat jitters; part of it was exasperation with my subjective and objective situation; part of it was that I was culturally conditioned to pack light and move fast and once you pointed me where I was supposed to go I was to figure out how to get there and at the end of the day I would have filled any gaps that needed filling and that mission would be accomplished.  This focus on mission accomplishment is hazardous in state building.  Policies may be wrong; avenues embarked down do not always have an outlet.  Yet vesting state building with military commanders who are bred to think this way will present the US administration with challenges.  They are culturally disposed to say Yes Sir and get the job done.  But what happens when the job doesn’t need to get done after a bit of investigation? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>(3) My Marines listened to me.  I listened to my commanders.  Except for those times where I was almost brought on insubordination charges, but that was a different story and in my defense he was going to get MY Marines fucked with his utterly idiotic tactical decisions.  What I valued when my hair was shorter was efficiency and speed.  I didn’t want debate about how training should be conducted or how the headquarters unit was going to displace.  I just wanted my Marines to do what I said.  Now what happens when you temper me with time and give me a bit of wisdom along with my gray hairs and tell me that I’m suddenly in charge of developing the governance sector in this province in Afghanistan?  If I’m given the option of two philosophies of governance: (1) a tribal chiefdom where 1 individual is in charge and I can coordinate with him; or (2) a  tribal council where I am forced to bargain and forced to cajole and forced to figure out a way to consensus, which of these do I choose?  I choose the former every day.  And maybe that is the correct choice, but maybe it isn’t.  When you multiply my impact radius by many provinces then you have the Cold War all over again with US Military upholding corrupt authoritarian regimes who are our tentative allies in the (FUCKING) &amp;ldquo;war on terror&amp;rdquo; but yet terrorists to their own people. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>(4) This must be the theme of the last two weeks, the US is turning its view inward but keeping its actions outward creating a narrow-minded giant careening through a world it understands little, leaving nothing but destruction in its wake.  No matter whether the fears that I have expressed supra are realized or not, the simple self-fulfilling prophesy nature of most foreign policies is really what is at issue.  No matter if military officers really are the ones performing state building around the world, or if they are being smart and integrating in a supporting role to State, the rest of the World is going to think that the Military is running the show.  This appearance by the rest of the world that the US is becoming even more militarized (when they look at the bloated DoD budgets and whatever other benchmarks they use) is going to remain true in their eyes.  Find me (historically) a militarized state that was a positive force for good in the world and I will recant, but I simply cannot think of one. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>This whole deal is being sold to Congress as with the same linear narrative we’ve heard time and time again: &amp;ldquo;You’re Un-American if you don’t give the troops all they need to fight terrorists.&amp;rdquo;  Now, for the moment, let’s set aside the fact that our simple minded foreign policies have cost us in the Billions.  Let’s just focus on the ongoing, and to the extent that I can tell, ONLY narrative of the Bush administration.  &amp;ldquo;Fuck you, I’m Fighting Me Some Fucking Terrorists.&amp;rdquo;  Not only do I fail to find any positive narrative there, I fail to find any narrative at all.  What is positive here?  Where is the hope?  Where is the vision?  I find nothing in this narrative of value. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure, Aid will continue to be doled out because of strategic concerns of the donor country.  Under this aid philosophy it is really of any import what the host country does with the money since the money is given to the host country as a quid pro quo.  This isn’t going to go away any time soon.  Yet there are continuing trends in the development community to reinforce success (a term that any military commander can endorse) and retreat from failure.  Where a receiving country has not shown the predicates of good governance they have been given less money, thus donor nations get their most poverty reduction bang for buck by focusing moneys on those governments willing to begin alleviating the poverty in their country.  The self-defeating aspect of the trend identified in the paper is that it will reallocate US donor money from the latter category to the former. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most frustrating thing to me about the trend identified in the paper is the equivocation of the administration about the whole deal.  They seem to grasp the major ideas: bad governance = poor, frustrated people; them an idea arms and training = terrorists.  The root cause of the entire equation is bad governance, lack of opportunity and a void of real, balanced education.  But yet in implementation shit like this happens:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Notwithstanding this rhetorical commitment to a holistic, integrated response that takes account of the economic, social and political sources of instability int he region, the program to date has been dominated by military considerations.  Although U.S. government players agree that the [counter-terrorism] strategy should focus eighty percent on development and governances activities, and only twenty percent on military effort, actual budgets have been closer to the reverse, making it difficult for the program to address underlying, chronic sources of underdevelopment and poor governance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There is a big part of me the questions if we are just priming ourselves for a meta-struggle by arming and training potential belligerents not to overthrow the Sandanista government but to overthrow our own government, seated in Washington because of our perceived Neo-Colonial Designs in Africa and elsewhere.  Anyone who thinks this as farfetched, take a detached look at the what will determine &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/37068.pdf">Strategic Suceess&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; for the newly implemented AFRICOM. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, my cynicism about the Bush Administration aside, there is value in some of this.  First off, the increased focus is positive in whatever way it comes.  Second, if the State Department can regain its traditional institutional standing vis a vis the Pentagon by convincing Congress to fund them on par relative to Defense then things could really explode for failing states.  Again, from the paper:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;To ensure a balanced U.S. approach to stability in Africa, the White House and Congress should insist that any policy integration that occurs at AFRICOM should reflect the firm leadership of the National Security Council (NSC) and a more adequately resourced State Department, supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development and U.S. embassies and USAID missions on the ground – and with the U.S. military playing a supporting role. . . .  The proposes solution of expanding DoD authorities, however, may create as many problems as it resolves, by undermining State Department leadership in foreign affairs.  Going forward the White House and Congress should seek to redress the misalignment between resources and authorities by going in the other direction: by increasing funding for the State Department, USAID and other civilian agencies to meet these urgent needs.  In principle, for example, there is no reason that the gaps . . . could not be met through greater (or more flexible) funding within existing State Department aid windows.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We’ll have to see how it all plays out.  But first, to the ’08 elections.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have been reading &lt;a href="http://chrisblattman.blogspot.com/">Chris Blattman’s blog&lt;/a> on development for a while, and today he posed a question about the admissibility of evidence.  He was legitimately questioning whether, as a legal or policy reason, drawing made by &lt;a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/politics/article3121175.ece#2007-11-02T00:00:01-00:00">children in Darfur &lt;/a>(such as the one presented here) should be admitted if they ever get &lt;a href="http://www.icc-cpi.int/cases/Darfur.html">Harun and Rahman&lt;/a>. &lt;/p>

Georgia was [AMAZING][2].  Highlands and I went there this past summer and I really fell in love with the people, with the environment, with the food, with the wine, with most everything there.  It is disappointing that there are many [allegations][3] of extensive human rights violations by the country and that there is the (real or not) perception of rampant corruption in the country.  These allegations have led to [massive protests ][4]in beautiful old Tbilisi.  There are huge possibilities for good in this country and I hope that the President, Saakashvili is smart enough to be able to quell this thing without having to resort to Soviet era tactics of repression.  I will be an unequivocal supporter of him if he can figure out a way to address the core of what the protestors are saying (his administration is a bastion of cronyism and the opposition’s voice is being suppressed using state resources). &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Big-Head and I had an entire business model worked up for a 501(c)(3) that would do this where the benefits would be local and engaged by the community.  Unfortunately due to a variety of factors we’ve lost the momentum on this and we’re not going to be the ones that can do it.  However I hope that there are people with more time and expertise than me who are willing to implement such a community building schema. &lt;/p>

Koroma sure talks a good game.  I’m a bit cynical, but yet hesitantly optimistic at the same time.  So far no reports of violence during the cabinet changeover, but the hope mandate will likely extend for more months, if not through the middle of next year.  You can hear Koroma’s interview for NPR (BBC in the US…sort of) at the link below.&lt;/p>

in case you’re an ostrich in a human’s body, or my dad, [radiohead has put out a new album][2], called in Rainbows.  it is only downloadable on the internet at this point.  it will come out in CD stores at some point in December, which basically requires you to ask WTF is the point of that.  nevermind.  the interesting thing about this is how they are doing it.  they have decided that there is no price point.  someone can pay anything they like from 1 pence (you pay in pounds…) to as high as you want.  they charge a 44 pence charge on your credit card, so the lowest you can pay is probably about $.90 depending on the exchange rate on a given date.  Nevertheless that is ridiculous.  I’m not going to tell you what I paid, but it was similar to what I pay for iTunes albums.  I will be interested to hear what kind of information they get out of it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the real point here is that the album is rich.  and i don’t mean to speak to its pecuniary interests.  it seems to me, after two not-incredibly close listens, that it is the continuation of a cohesive narrative arc beginning with the bends and running through OK directly to this album.  although it seems to integrate some parts of the kid A/amnesiac sidebar, as well as a lot of the things i enjoyed from hail to the thief.  it seems different than those two albums.  maybe i’ll be editing this later, not sure and recanting on my words.  but for now, that is my thought.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Conscious that I’m treading in shark-infested waters, especially with my family: I’m not vehemently anti-death penalty.  But I am death penalty. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not so much for the cruel nature of the punishment.  I don’t think the act itself it is normatively worse than keeping someone in prison for their life.  It is cruel.  But I, personally, feel that it is no more worse than many other ways that retributive punishment enacts &amp;ldquo;societies vengence&amp;rdquo; upon an individual. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m anti-death penalty because I think that (1) it has little to no additional deterrent effect, (2) it is intellectually bankrupt and morally anarchic, and (3) it costs too much. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I fail to see what additional deterrent effect that it has over and above life imprison.  We don’t see more or less Murders in Texas than we do in California.  The empirical evidence is simply conclusive that people are going to murder and having the legal authority to be able to sanction a heart for a heart has no statistical effect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Come on.  Are we really that uncreative?  I know many people will claim that the point of the criminal justice system is to vindicate victim’s rights.  I am usually a big proponent of this philosophy.  Restorative justice and deterrence are, traditionally, my two favorite justifications for even having a criminal justice system at all.  Well, those and incapacitation, but I have divergent opinions on incapacitation with regards to the domestic and international fora. That aside, I fail to see outside the heat of the moment passions why a victim would care specifically that someone die.  Yes there are so many holes in that statement that an infant could argue through it.  That said, I return to an argument explored above.  There has been no great public outcry by victim’s families in the majority of states in the US who do not have the death penalty.  If it was really that poignant to victim’s families that the perpetrator die than I think you would have strong pro-death penalty rallies.  It isn’t like Republicans (now I fail to see why this is, necessarily, a traditionally conservative political platform, but it has been drawn under the umbrella of being a Republican without a doubt) have no ability to organize a campaign they care strongly about.  See Pro-Life.  Further, isn’t an eye for an eye Old Testament and turn the other cheek New Testament?   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>And,lastly: It costs more to try someone in a death penalty case than in a life imprisonment.  It costs more to the degree than on sum it costs more to kill someone than to imprison them for their life.  Yes, that includes the costs of imprisoning them for life.  I will find the statistics later. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somehow Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Burundi, Gabon and Mali are very close to a complete abolition of the penalty.  And here we are.  Although I think it is a dubious legal argument, it is an extremely strong public policy argument: &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A total of 133 UN member states, from all regions in the world, have&lt;br>
abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Only 25 countries&lt;br>
carried out executions in 2006, 91 percent of them in just six&lt;br>
countries: China, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Sudan and the USA. Those that&lt;br>
chose this most cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment are&lt;br>
increasingly in the minority.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Is that the list we want to be in?  In all of Africa, the most violent continent in the world there were only six countries who legally sanctioned executions as a criminal penalty in 2006. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/09/bono.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/10/09/bono.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, and since coming to law school my analytical abilities and knowledge of the both the problems and possible solutions have been slightly refined.  I am very, very ignorant on this topic, but I have been able to form philosophical views on a few third-world poverty issues and back those up with real reasoning, something that I couldn’t do on the sunny sunday afternoon in Aspen with the mountains behind me and my deck to sit on, smoke and think while the TV behind me blared Green Day and Bruce Springsteen and other left leaning celebrities who didn’t really know what they were arguing for except that they were getting widespread coverage. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing that I now think is that there are countries it is worth saving.  That statement has a lot of nuances to it, I realize, but suffice it for here because I have to go to class soon, that Liberia is one of those countries.  Take the time to tell the IMF that Liberia is worth saving if you agree with what is written by&lt;a href="http://blogs.cgdev.org/mt/mt-tb.cgi/981"> this dude&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This should not be read to be an indictment of Bono’s analytical skills, cause everyone that knows me knows that I totally want to be Bono.&lt;/p>

I am a big supporter of The Gambia for somehow convincing everyone to include the &amp;ldquo;The&amp;rdquo; in their name.  They also (apparently) have nice typical West African beaches. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>However there are some messed up things going on there.  For one it is one of the most repressive dictatorships in West Africa.  For another their sex worker industry is patronized by old, dirty people who apparently strut around would lithe young Africans for a weekend at the time and then disappear.  Lastly, the tourist areas are completely shut off from the people. The dictator, to ensure his tourism revenue, does not allow the normal populace go near the tourist areas.  IT IS THEIR F’ING COUNTRY….makes me mad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7033715.stm">they’re accusing AI people of spying&lt;/a>.  That isn’t the way to make friends…especially with Britian who sends you most of your tourism revenue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The world bank is launching a competition to figure out how to light africa with  something other than little kerosene lamps.  They will choose 10 to 20 of the competition participants and give them something like $200k to pursue their plans further.  Not sure what will happen after that, but hopefully something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lamps were serene in their simplistic beauty.  You would turn a corner in Freetown and see the flicker of small kerosene lamps lighting up the rows of kiosks of people selling biscuits and fruit and cigarettes.  But the lamps also broke your heart because you knew that that was the only source of light besides the sun that these people had.  Meanwhile Westereners are going blind under the force of our neon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another heartbreaking antidote is that sometimes you would see kids outside right on the narrow streets doing their homework because the lights from the passing cars were the only way they could get something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the WB can figure out how to provide cheap lighting that is off the grid (or on a very local grid) that would be fantastic.  But the big if is who is going to finance this.  There are 250 M people here spread over much of a continent…the problems are so vast i sometimes get vertigo when i start to ponder them.  But one bite at a time, maybe the elephant will get eaten….maybe.&lt;/p>

More good environmental news from BBC.  The worst part is that the gorillas are getting killed in the great lakes area for their meat and for other things.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Heading to Austin this weekend for &lt;a href="http://aclfestival.com/default.aspx">ACL&lt;/a>.  Quite stoked to see Bloc Party and Indigo Girls.  Don’t fuck with me I’m serious.  I once had a professor in undergrad who moved the final because Dave Matthews was playing, and when he announced this he said that if the Indigo Girls were playing he would have canceled the finals because he loved them so much that he would want to ensure that we went to see them.  Now that’s fan devotion.  Of course Dylan will be there.  I think he will be a gamble, either really good or really bad.  White Stripes and Byork should also be good.  Will hopefully listen to some COW Bell action with LCD Soundsystem, although I hope they play at night as they would not be good to see during the day.  Other highlights: Arcade Fire, Gotan Project, Clap Your Hands, Ghostland Observatory and it goes on and on.&lt;/p>

I’m very nervous, but hopeful.  It is now 1830 in Freetown/Salone and BBC has not (yet) reported of any violence.  This isn’t terribly surprising to me.  I think if violence gets propagated it will be by whoever loses this run-off, which will not be known for a while. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The sign on the very last picture is at the &amp;ldquo;top&amp;rdquo; of Kroo Bay slum and at the &amp;ldquo;bottom&amp;rdquo; of my street, King Street.  I used to &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/underwater/2007/03/i_little_trip_t.html">walk/drive&lt;/a> (after starting dating Highlands and her car) past that sign a couple of times a day.  It is nice to see the Krio again.  I really, really miss Africa in general, Salone in specific.  How soon can I get back?  Highlands gets to go back for a month, she leaves on monday…..&amp;ldquo;LUCKY.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

The DA in Miami has added more counts of torture to Chuckie’s indictment.  His trial is set to begin in Miami in January 2008.  I find it cute that father and son will begin their trials at about the same time. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Chuckie is Charles Taylor’s son, he was the former President (dictator) of Liberia who was one of the most infamous warlords ever.  The African President from &lt;a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lord_of_war/">Lord of War&lt;/a> was based (loosely) on Charles Taylor.  Chuckie was born in Boston but raised in Orlando area, and is roughly my age.  I wonder if I ever ran into him at the &lt;a href="http://www.altamonte.org/development/projects/images/AMC.jpg">Altamonte Mall movie theater&lt;/a>. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>When we left the country to go to Azerbaijan (Which is another story entirely, that autocratic, authoritarian, repressive state took our Lonely Planet guidebook and in general I have very little good to say about Az, except that many of the non-government people we met were quite nice.) Russia &amp;ldquo;bombed&amp;rdquo; Georgia.  The bomb was a dud that landed in some farmer’s backyard about half-way between Tbilisi (the capital) and the border with Russia.  There were a lot of odd things about that that I thought at the time but cannot currently remember.  Nonetheless it was sketchy at best. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Saakashvili, Georgia’s president, was supposed to meet with Putin in order to quell some of the tensions, (at least ostensibly) but I am not sure whether that happened or not.  Whether it did or not seems immaterial to this inflaming further tensions between the two.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is this band that Highlands and I saw this summer which we both loved called &lt;a href="http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;amp;searchlink=BAJOFONDO&amp;amp;sql=11:hcftxqw0ldse~T0">Bajofondo Tango Club&lt;/a>.  I have described them elsewhere.  They were Argentine and fabulously crazy.  This bank, Gogol Bordello, does to Russia what Bajofondo do to Argentina:  rock its world with a fusion of traditional rhythms and sounds with new beats and sounds.  Gogol is more rock inspired where Bajofondo is more dance inspired, but I think that is more a reflection of the specific musical leanings of each region rather than any specific choice.  There is not much overlap between the two bands that I can type out, however there is a certain parallel of energy between the two when you listen to them. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>spent monday with a friend in miami and then drove to orlando.  almost instantly after stepping off the plane i acquired a cold that has just now left me despite od’ing on airborne.  spent tuesday in orlando with my mom and then drove on wednesday to chattanooga to see my uncle.  then drove to nashville thursday morning for a meeting with my mentor and orientation for my journal.  crashed thursday afternoon with a massive headache.  spent friday pulling miles of boxes out of my storage unit.  spent saturday constructing and placing the furniture and big stuff in.  spent sunday arranging, decorating and returning all the stuff that i’m not going to be able to keep here to the unit.  then today i started classes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>have a fairly light class load this semester which is good as i’m working on two independent projects which are going to take up much of my time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>urbanization (and other factors) is being blamed for a dramatic increase in the population in sub-saharan africa.  the problems with this should be self-evident.  poverty in this region is incredibly rampant and governments cannot use the few resources (mainly involving agricultural land which is lacking region wide, despite is prevalence in western africa) to feed and build their economies at the current population levels.  fertility rates are much higher in africa than in the other world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>traditional responses to population control have been to develop the country in concert with gender-equality measures.  the thinking is that women who are working will have less time to make babies as they have other things to do.  there may be something to this as in most industrial democracies women have much lower fertility rates.  yet, in africa people have been trying to develop the economies of the continent for years and they’re still in the position that their in economically despite those efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>another traditional response has been to force condoms, but this has very little likelihood of success as most african’s see it as the white people telling them not to have sex and they don’t really use the condoms.  it has worked for aids awareness, but not for population control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>china just killed babies and outlawed procreation.  i don’t see that happening either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so, while listening to this i must admit that a horrible, cynical thought was creeping into my mind.  i thought, well if the health system stays as awful as it is in most countries i don’t see a crisis cause so many people die.  maybe it was a big conspiracy to suppress populations. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>to my surprise the commentator said the exact opposite of what i was thinking.  he said that we should put even more emphasis on reducing infant mortality rates (which was the opposite of what i had been thinking during his analysis of the problem).  he argued that this would allow people to self-regulate in that they would know that they were going to have surviving heirs to take care of them in their old age without having to make five babies to get one to survive and have a good, long life.  i agree with him as it is positive and forward thinking….maybe a bit unrealistic in the short term, but that epitomizes my life anyway!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Africa’s challenge today is that while the era of dictatorship has&lt;br>
apparently come to an end, African countries do not as yet have&lt;br>
indigenous institutions and leaders that promote cooperation among the&lt;br>
citizens. Developing such institutions is a difficult and costly&lt;br>
business that takes a long time. It is made even more complex by the&lt;br>
fact that firstly, the re-democratisation of African countries from the&lt;br>
mid 1990s was brought about to a significant extent by interventions of&lt;br>
Western donors rather than primarily by pro-democracy actions of&lt;br>
African organisations or parties. The main exceptions which prove the&lt;br>
rule being Uganda and Rwanda, and possibly Nigeria.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another of my favorites, and how he opens the speech:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The world has done just about everything it could do to help Africa to&lt;br>
develop but has very little positive results to show for its efforts.&lt;br>
While most of the world, especially Asia, is forging ahead in the&lt;br>
development stakes, Africa is marking time at best, and marching&lt;br>
backwards in some instances.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>ok back to proofreading.&lt;/p>

Rumsfeld decision is the executive issuing an executive order that CIA interrogation techniques, if conducted for the purpose of eliciting intelligence are per sae legal.  there are a few nuances in the order, first the techniques must not violate the McCain Ammendment against torture or dismemberment (but according to most human rights decisions this leaves a wide berth).  secondly, the techniques must not be conducted with the purpose of degrading the human.  well, shit, that just about guts the protections that the Hamdan decision offered to detainees at Guantanamo (and hopefully by extrapolation to other detention facilities, although there is no jurisprudence on point with regards to that issue — yet). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>two men with conservative pedigrees which few could attack have written an &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/25/AR2007072501881.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns">OpEd in the Washington Post calling out the Administration&lt;/a> for this lack of deference and showing how wrong the decision is based upon common international legal interpretation principles. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i understand that we need to keep the country safe.  i have no quibble with national security scholars who dicker over specifics, but this is a bridge too far for me.  by simply saying that the purpose of the interrogation is paramount in any determination we are gutting the protections found in Common Article 3.  full stop.  the CIA will always be able to argue that it is interrogating for the purpose of eliciting intelligence, in fact it is all it does and even in the most degrading of treatments all they have to do is to ask a question (no matter how obvious or mundane) and then claim that the purpose was to gather intelligence.  once they get through the wicket then they are enable to do whatever they want per the text of the executive order. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it seems that the administration is digging a hole to bury itself in needlessly.  there are other ways to protect yourself without stooping to tit for tat reciprocity. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Now the woman known as either Ellen or Ma on the streets of Monrovia has added another thing to her growing CV in the mind of me. She has &lt;a href="http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnL18112308.html" title="News | Africa - Reuters.com">joined&lt;/a> the &lt;a href="http://www.eitransparency.org/">Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative&lt;/a> set up by Tony Blair in 2002 which will progress transparency in the extraction of natural resources.  The website says this about EITI:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) supports&lt;br>
improved governance in resource-rich countries through the verification&lt;br>
and full publication of company payments and government revenues from&lt;br>
oil, gas, and mining.  The Initiative works to build multi-stakeholder&lt;br>
partnerships in developing countries in order to increase the&lt;br>
accountability of governments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good governance is a precondition for converting large revenues from&lt;br>
extractive industries into economic growth and poverty reduction. When&lt;br>
transparency and accountability are weak, the extractive industries may&lt;br>
instead contribute to poverty, corruption, and conflict—the so-called&lt;br>
“resource curse.” The EITI is an important step in defeating this&lt;br>
“curse.”&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The links between good governance and the ability of a government to alleviate the poverty in their country are &lt;a href="http://www.typepad.com/t/trackback/2401758/20081356">nearly synonymous&lt;/a> and i’m writing a long paper on them right now.  Suffice it for here to say that when countries have good governance not only do they spend what little money they have &amp;ldquo;well&amp;rdquo; in the sense that they spend it on things that will help in the short-, medium-, and long-term to alleviate poverty, not only are they traditionally less corrupt, but they also get more money from donors.  these three things usually create a symbiotic causal linkage whereby donors will see exponential returns on their money in the form of poverty reduction. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>that is all for now.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the act of sending peace-keepers with an EU mandate i find inherently fascinating.  this is a fundamental (in my mind) difference from sending peace-keepers with a mandate from the UN or a regional international organization of which the affected country is a part of.  this is neither the OAU or the UN (chad is a member of each and therefore has ceded sovereignty to those organizations), but this is the EU acting with Chad’s blessing, but in a forceful way, creating peace and policing borders of a state which is not a member state of the IO’s. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>historically, at least since post WWII, the UN has been the organization with the mandate to maintain and restore the peace.  it has retained that mandate, but it has been watered down due to inefficiencies in the system, the lack of engagement by the powerful countries on the security counsel, and simple international politics and power-games.  at least in africa what has filled the gap have been regional international organizations.  for instance in western africa there is the economic community of west african states or &lt;a href="http://www.ecowas.int/">ECOWAS.&lt;/a>  ecowas started (like the EC) as a regional economic organization and eventually blossomed into the realm of peacekeeping when it sent the ECOWAS Military Observation Group or ECOMOG into Liberia (and subsequently other member states).  the ECOWAS member states argued in 1991 just before ECOMOG went into Liberia, that it was in the economic interest of the member states to build and maintain peace in each country of the member states.  similarly, the &lt;a href="http://www.africa-union.org/">OAU&lt;/a> and the &lt;a href="http://www.thecommonwealth.org/">Commonwealth&lt;/a> have also performed peacekeeping missions inside member states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>again each of these makes sense to me as the &amp;ldquo;targetted&amp;rdquo; state has signed up for a given international organization and has a say in what they do.  the EU deployment to chad is different in that it is more like a bilateral partnership with the US, the UK, or the like.  but how can the EU which is a multilateral organization create bilateral partnerships without the member states of the multilateral organization either: (1) having a say in each and every decision which is wholly impossible especially in a peacekeeping mission with too many decision points (i say this in contrast to signing a services contract where the decisions points are up front and then maybe at renegotiation), or (2) the member states outsourcing decision making to the peacekeeping force itself or to the international organization.  the latter is what happens in the US where the individual states have outsourced all foreign policy matters to the federal government. see &lt;a href="http://coalitionfordarfur.blogspot.com/2007/07/chad-eu-must-agree-to-strong-mandate.html">this&lt;/a> for a discussion of the mandate that the EU will likely/should have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>europe is definitely not to that point, (despite how flattering it would be for them to go that far) but i question how far it will get along the road before the policies of the member states become divergent.  it is easy for the member states to agree on the norm against genocide or crimes against humanity.  it is another thing if the EU wants to adopt a nuanced foreign policy position with regards to Russia’s response to &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6902046.stm">Britain kicking out the Russian Diplomats&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i don’t know where it is heading, and of course being american i am not so much of a stake holder, but it is interesting to watch nonetheless.&lt;/p>

[this][2] has promise.  i’ve heard about it before, but this article in the nytimes breaks it down nicely.  essentially, it uses the sun’s heat to formulate steam to turn generators to produce power rather than using photovoltaic cells which are inefficient and terribly expensive (although the prices are going down quickly and may go down further the more that they are made). photothermal cells produce heat by focussing the sun’s rays onto a specific metallic point. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/18/17thermal600.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/07/18/17thermal600.jpg&lt;/a>

&lt;p>one thing that has always concerned me about solar that currently&lt;br>
concerns me is that there is a massive amount of heavy metals and heavy&lt;br>
chemicals to process the heavy metals that are required to produce&lt;br>
photovoltaic cells  i don’t know that much about the photothermal cells&lt;br>
but they appear to be mirrors more than anything.  if that is the case&lt;br>
then they may be a bit more enviro-friend to make rather than only&lt;br>
enviro-friend to use. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>now i lived in the desert for four years, i’ve felt the power of the sun on metal (most times accidentally, because i’m a klutz) and i know how hot it can get things  the question i have had about this technology since i first heard about it on a podcast about a year ago is whether it would be powerful enough to turn generators enough to have a decent capacity per land use acre.  it seems that it is, as this farm the NYT’s reports on has a higher capacity than even the largest photovoltaic farms.  this capacity is seemingly low…64 megawatts…when compared to an average coal-fired or natural-gas-fired plant which average over 500 megawatts. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>however this concern can be mitigated if the business plan of huge, centralized power plants transmitting power over massive geographical scapes (with the attendant loss of electricity over each mile of power line transmission, which if i remember correctly from my undergraduate coursework is something like 2% or so per mile), to something more localized.  there is a lot of work being done on this that i’ve read and if i can scrounge will post links to, but many scholars are researching whether it would be more efficient to put lots of small energy generating devices around a region rather than centralizing.  it may be more costly for the energy companies as they would have to service more locations, but it may not be as the smaller devices may break down at a slower rate and be less expensive to maintain, also they may be more reliable as redundancies could be placed into the system in more locations with more flexibility.  also there may be environmental benefits by spreading out whatever pollution is created.  nevertheless i’d put a photothermal farm on my roof.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the most heartening statistic in the entire piece is that the photothermal cells are producing electricity at about 12 to 14 cents per kilowatt-hour where the national average is 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  although that may be after subsidies (it wasn’t exactly clear), they are also subject to inefficiencies due to the nascent status of the technology.  so it seems likely that if the subsidies were tapered off the costs may remain the same or even decrease as it becomes cheaper to make the farms and as they understand the technology more and can tweak its efficiencies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>over time my feelings about africa turned from an infatuation into something like a better understand more akin to love where faults are recognized rather than painted over and beauty becomes completely subjective. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>one of the jobs that i researched at the beginning and would have considered doing throughout my waxes and wanes of desire to stay (but wouldn’t have done in the end as i came to europe for other reasons) was to monitor the elections that were originally supposed to be in july and have now been pushed back to august.  i emailed the carter group as well as the national democratic institute to see if either of them was monitoring the elections (nDi was) and if they needed help/volunteers/interns (they didn’t at the time, but that was early february).  ever since i arrived it was a hot button issues and whenever i was talking to saloneans and i ran out of topics like the weather and the fact that i was white but not likely to be able to sponsor their education in london through the graduate level and world news, i would turn to politics.  they were always happy to engage in a nice political debate and to give you their perspective on the political landscape as they saw it.  it was funny how authoritative they would speak about it.  i have since realized how &amp;ldquo;african&amp;rdquo; their speeches were.  they would nearly always begin at the beginning and give me the entire landscape with all its attendent complicating and simplifying factors from the 1968 elections up to the currently scheduled election, the traditional lines of support and the various tribal and chiefdom factors as they applied traditionally and currently.  one thing that struck me is how simple, yet complex within a given culture and situation, the game of politics is.  it is very straightforward and seemingly easy to play.  yet one must still remain within the systemic and cultural constraints, and these often provide the complications. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the international crisis group has just yesterday published a &lt;a href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/home/getfile.cfm?id=3016&amp;amp;tid=4942&amp;amp;type=pdf&amp;amp;l=1">report&lt;/a> about the upcoming elections.   if you are interested in a western synopsis of the above, granted without the flair of the happy krio accent and grandiose hand gestures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>there are three main candidates: solomon berewa, charles margai and ernest koroma.  berewa is the current vice-president, leader of the SLPP and current frontrunner.  he generally represents a semi-compentence with a bit of international credibility, yet he has essentially been running the country since 2002 and so represents the status quo to many saloneance.  margai is the old gadfly who has been buzzing about salone politics for years, formerly SLPP and currently the leader of the newly formed PMDC.  he seems to have much to prove and overly eager, there is something about him that seethes corruption to me.  koroma is the wild-card and head of the APC.  no one seems very sure of him, although he is a bit younger than the others they all represent (to most saloneans i spoke with) shades of gray.  no one brings any true hope or really engages the imagination of the people.  this is a shame on all levels i can possibly think of.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>as for the weekend, i did nothing and it was fantabulous.  i did meet with one of my mentors which was great.  we are hopefully going to be working on some good projects this fall, the nice thing for me is that they may link to what i’m doing now.  it will be quite nice to not be starting from step one, as per the norm in law school.  it will be nice to be able to dive deeply having much of the introduction stuff out of the way.  but for now i’m working on my paper from SL titled:  Sleepy Justice: Sierra Leone’s Lack of Self-Help in Judicial Sector Reform…or something similar.  I’ll post it when it is presentable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>last night i finished packing in my idiosyncratic, logical-but-only-to-me, methodical way.  then i put on some nice music and stood on my balcony watching my last salone sunset.  like so many others it was underwhelming.  the sun faded into clouds, but if you looked to the east the nice purples developed and if you looked to the west, above the clouds, you could see the pinks and oranges.  it makes a nice metaphor for my final week here.  so much excitement, disappointment, frustration and sadness wrapped into each moment.  it wasn’t the finality of leaving a beautiful place that got to me, it was everything else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>on sunday 22 people died in a helicopter crash, but the only friggin’ reason that the damn bird was flying was because the owner of the heli company bribed the transportation minister after the last fire to let his company keep on flying.  two days ago the manager of the reservoir company which supplies the water to freetown was driving into freetown and saw some men filling their fire truck with public water to sell to lebanese and expat compounds.  they were stealing his water, and he is the one blamed whenever there is a shortage of water in freetown.  this practice is pervasive in the firemen community, apparently.  when the engineer stopped and told them not to do it, they beat him. to death. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>in a lot of ways it is time for me to leave here.  i feel that i have exhausted the good that i can do at this level of power which i currently possess.  i also feel, exhausted.  it is difficult, madening, and just tiring to live here.  but i love it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the people are wonderful.  this morning martha was crying as i popped in my friends car buoyed by the prospects of my final adventure, undaunted by her tears lingering on my shoulder from our hug moments before.  i sat there and thought about the moment for a bit before i pulled out of my compound for the final time.  to me this has been an adventure, an exercise.  to saloneans, this is their life.  it breaks my heart.  a heavy cloud of sadness decending from the threatening rainclouds over my psyche. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>yesterday i drove with some friends through a tropical drenching with waterfalls all around tossing mud and trash onto streets and bridges making it all but passable.  the car had no a/c so the windshield was completely fogged at times, but people sauntered gingerly, just trying to keep their nice shoes from getting too mud splashed in the torential downpour with umbrellas to keep their beautiful, bright, colorful clothes pristine.  it blows my mind how long suffering these people are with their current state of existence. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>to me it is not surprising that there was a war, i’m only surprised that it actually ended and that it didn’t begin before it did. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i drove up to leischeter peak this morning after leaving my compound for the final time.  i liked the circularity of it.  brett and i were driven up there on our first real day in salone.  it has a gorgeous view of the entire city, but when we arrived the harmatan winds had left the city opaque due to sahara dust.  today, because of the rains, the clarity hurt my eyes.  there were things that you couldn’t see, from the viewpoint you cannot see many of the larger slums throughout the city, and the beauty blows your mind.  the only sounds were birds and the clinks of people far below me whose only occupation is to break big rocks into smaller rocks…for something like $5 a week. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>up there i reflected upon how much i have learned here.  living one of the poorest countries in the world is doable.  you can create certain things if you know how to do it, you can host a party, you can get your car fixed, you can order catering.  you just have to know how to do it.  i finally feel like i reached the tipping point where i know how to do nearly everything that would need to happen, or at least i know who to talk to to get the number of someone that can do it for me.  it is a good feeling to feel settled and at ease with your surroundings.  it is surreal that those surroundings are not a new city or state in america, but rather one of the poorest countries in the world. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this is it, this experience was a gamble.  if i had come to salone and hated my existence here all my pontifications and career decisions up to now would have been for naught.  but i have loved it here, and all those have been crystallized.  it is what i want to do.  here is why:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>last night i was sitting on the concrete surrounded by eight young african men all talking in krio.  i understood most of what they were saying, and they didn’t even bother to translate or keep me in the loop.  i laughed at their jokes.  i gave the approriate krio exclamatory statements.  i felt a part of their community.  two of my old gaurds had come by along with some others that were not currently on duty to farewell me.  we were just sitting.  one of them had a portable cd player and was playing a cd i gave him, the most famous salone artist: emerson.  the fifth track on the song is titled, miss you.  it is about giving a lover a second chance, fairly non-complex lyrics.  they one by one fell silent until one of the young ones stood up and did a little dance to the song.  then he asked me whether i knew what the song was about.  i lied and told him no.  he told me the first part of it and then said that it meant something to him, that they were all going to miss me.  then i quoted that part in krio where the singer says that the lover should give him a second chance.  i meant that at some point i’ll be back.  they all laughed and then kept on taking the piss out of one another.  i will remember that moment for a very long time. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>now, for the next adventure.  sweet salone, i bid you adieu.  let’s do this again sometime very soon, but for now i need to go do some other things.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>urs and i made a weekend trip to liberia.  other highlights which you will have to ask me about over a drink: missing the helicopter and taking a speed boat at mach two in 5 foot seas at oblique angles to the trajectory of the boat in order for 25 minutes in order to make our plane.  almost being forced into an impromptu inspection of a liberian immigration detention facility. food and beverage smuggling. &lt;a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;amp;click_id=68&amp;amp;art_id=nw20070604113522453C836170">avoiding taking&lt;/a> the helicopter which crashed and killed 22 other people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but that is not all i have to say about that.  there were a lot of differences for only a forty minute flight.  one definite difference is that the people there are colder.  i told urs that i felt like the smiles didn’t come as easy as they do to SLeans but when they came they were bigger.  they are a bigger people, overall, that the SLeans for sure.  and maybe due to the proximity of the war, but they feel overall more militant. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it was weird there the dynamics between the whites and the blacks that i observed.  overall it seemed that the whites were almost subservient to the blacks.  it wasn’t exactly a power dynamic realignment, it was more like business humans schmoozing with government and in this case it was amplified b/c the business people were white and the ministers, etc. were black.  but it was odd to see, and good to see that almost everywhere we went blacks were a majority.  you may think, well, duh, you’re in africa.  but in SL it is not like that.  most every place where the expats go they go in droves and there will be very few black people there.  it is hideous and annoys me to no end, and i try to avoid it but sometimes the avoiding is harder than the capitulating.  i have rarely seen a SL minister or high-ranking official, even in the nice places.  and in only a few minutes in the mamba point hotel in monrovia i saw two ministers and two senators and a few congressmen.  so had i stayed longer and not left for drinks at the marine house on the us embassy compound where a friend of mine had been ten years before during some massive unrest, i’m sure i would have seen more.  we saw charles taylor’s wife at the grocery store.  i have never seen anyone of import in SL.  never.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but the white people there seemed odd to me.  more hardened than here. less save the world types and more…different.  i was trying for some time to put my finger on what it was and i still cannot.  i think that the white people there also have a hard life and many of them do not have the freedom that we have here in SL to mingle.  also you saw a lot more old people there. not the white people so much but dignified african gentlemen and ladies.  it was good to see how elegant they looked, but it was also good to see that either they have eradicated a lot of diseases or their healthcare system is marginally better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the city itself is slightly more developed in my opinion than freetown.  the power is about the same, but the water situation is better (it is easier b/c of the lack of hills) and the transportation infrastructure is miles ahead.  construction infrastructure and construction itself is vastly more improved than here in freetown where they are still constructing with manpower and wheelbarrows, there they had he3avy machinery and a certain taste in architecture which you will not find elsewhere.  also the port is a freeport and is operational, there is an industrial sector which is about ready to come back online and the sanctions on their diamonds have just been lifted and on other products it is about to be lifted.  so they are well-established to make leaps and bounds of improvements if they continue their current trend.   &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the last tanglible difference was how much more urban it felt.  there was one beach bar in monrovia, but only one.  here there are many.  freetown in comparison is more like a laid-back beach community and monrovia was more like a city that is going places and has things to do.  the streets were wide but moveable.  the clubs were not open air but where inside and the music was less african and more american/european.  monrovia had more sectors or more planned urban design than freetown. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>so that is my review of the difference there were others that we realized, but those are the main ones worthy of note.  now i must work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i leave on thursday night to go to amsterdam and then down to the hague.  i should arrive in the hague friday afternoon.  i’ll be there through the summer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first story is about a light.  A small little light, not hidden under a bush oh no.  I used to tell the first part of the story at dinner parties as I thought it was a nice picture of lost in translation, but then I realized that it wasn’t lost in translation and felt really bad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we first moved here the lights in the kitchen didn’t work.  In order to cook we had to leave the door to the refrigerator open to light the kitchen.  There were a lot of problems with this, not the least of which is that the refrigerator is only on during the night anyway and whatever is in there tends to partially cook during the day and so will only stay good for a very short time.  In addition the little of cool air that the food gets in the evening is compromised by having the door open.  Another in furiating thing is that the light coming out of the fridge was not very bright and it was still quite dreary.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few nights I put my foot down.  Generally I like to think that with a little extra effort you can achieve a decent standard of living, and so along those lines I told our &amp;ldquo;landlord&amp;rdquo; that we just needed a light in the kitchen.  It was of no moment to me that she has a cook who she treats like shit and we cook for ourselves, I wasn’t bothered by the fact that she was never in there.  We were and she needed to provide a lamp for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So she conceded to buy a lamp and she told Ibrahim to go out the next day and buy a lamp.  Backflash a few days.  The light in Brett’s room wasn’t working and he had asked Ibrahim to buy a small reading light for him.  So Ibrahim had recently bought this little reading light for Brett, one of those small things that you clip onto the books.  But Brett’s also had a stand and you could plug it in. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the landlord asked Ibrahim to buy a lamp for the kitchen he bought another of these little reading things.  It didn’t light the kitchen as well as the small light in the fridge, but at least we didn’t have to leave the door open to the fridge and let our food further spoil!!!!  I used to tell this story as a funny bit to illustrate how easily things could get lost in translation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then a bit later I walked out of my compound and was heading down the hill to congo cross (the big intersection) to catch a cab and go somewhere…posh, i’m sure, and as I passed one of the little shack-villes i saw that there were seven people sitting around one of these little lights. it clicked for me then that it wasn’t lost in translation, this was what they knew.  Ibrahim didn’t know any better, I think.  To him that was a lamp to light a room. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It broke my heart for a lot of reasons. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second story ends with the following phrase: so at least now I’ve had my alone, car broke down, no money and no phone in a third world country miles from no where story.  You’ll have to ask me that one over a beer! &lt;/p>

&lt;p>i thought that it would then be ridiculous to stay here and just sit on my bum all weekend when everyone else that i cared about was upcountry having fun.  so i decided to go.  the only question was how the hell to get up country to meet them.  they had a car that blazed our identity to anyone who knows just a little bit.  the license plate is blue and has a nice code which reveals our identity to all who know.  yet, they were already in bo the second largest city in sierra leone.  and i was six hours away in freetown.  i put my white boy-ness aside for a bit and thought that africans are doing it all the time.  so i went downstairs to talk to my guards about the who/what/when/where/why.  they told me that if i got on the poda-poda bus at like 4 in the morning i could get up to bo by 8 or so.  i decided it was all systems go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>woke up at four in the morning on saturday to begin the adventure.  hopped on the back of a motorcycle taxi to go downtown to the place where the buses are.  met up with some folks to find out the correct bus.  at about 5:30 the bus finally got underway.  they sit us five across, so i did not have enough room to get the money out of my pocket to pay (later in the morning).  for the first part it was quiet as everyone was sleepy.  but it was still like every movie i’ve ever seen with the one white human on the developing country bus.  i was smooshed in with all the africans who were going to see family and what not.  it was loud and hot and bumpy and hot and dusty and hot and smelly and hot.  it was great!  i had my bag on my lap and just gaiped through the entire five hour ride.  got up to bo about 1030 in the morning, hopped on a different motorcycle taxi and met up with my friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>all along the ride i was surprised at how open everything was.  freetown is really really congested, but once you get outside of freetown there is so much space and air.  the space feels larger due to all the deforestation (but that is a different post entirely).  feng shui aside, it was beautiful countryside.  will put up picts when i can get some bandwidth.  the little villages we passed along the way were neat and orderly.  the houses were all in lines not helterskelter, there was zero trash lying around, the cooking pits and wells and toilets were all clearly dilineated, even to my eye as 60 kph on a bus with dust covered windows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we trolleyed off in the car after i met up with them towards kenema.  on our way we saw all these kool villages and decided to stop at one.  these villages were the real deal.  i mean it was AFRICA.  it was authentic.  it was real.  it hasn’t changed in centuries.  they live in clay houses.  first they build with sticks cut down from medium-sized trees with machetes a lattice-work and then they fill in the holes with mud.  it is like building with bricks, but not.  they put on a roof of palm fronds which doesn’t really work in the rainy season.  we sat around in their community center chatting with them about the seasons, voting preference, voting knowledge, how to farm corn, what it is like to have cobras biting your chilren when they are supposed to be learning their three R’s, the perils of having people use the toilet wherever they like, the intricacies of soccer in the bush, proper cutlass (machete) technique, stories old legends and other topics which i cannot currently remember.  there were a few men eloquent in english and the rest sort of stood around and listened.  we toured the place and took tons of pictures.  they have, in this village of less than 200, a mosque and a church.  they pay for their own teacher as it is too far for the kids to walk to school.  they grow rice and beans and corn and other vegetables and coconuts and mangoes and papaya.  they cook as a community.  it was crazy. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i would have stayed there all afternoon just talking, but we had other things to do.  rolled out and rocked up to kenema town.  there wasn’t much of a place to park, except for at the radio station.  we got out and of course tons of africans piled out to see the aputus (white people in mende). since we continually pay the complexion tax and get charged more for everything we buy i figured we should turn in some of that so i asked if we could get a tour of the radio station.  they were happy to comply.  so we got a tour of the little kenema radio station which broadcasts for a quarter of this country the bbc feed and other local programming.  the station manager gave me some good leads on good, older SL music. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>we walked around in the stifling heat, sweating.  saw crazy, sketchy diamond dealers, a few other notable things.  then we rocked out of town to see this catholic mission.  it was beautiful and wide open with lines of coconut palm trees planted in orderly fashion, old buildings in a college like campus environ.  the beautiful hills were backset and the beautiful people were foreset.  it was wonderfully relaxing.  we all thought it would be brilliant if freetown had a place where you could go, sit outside in the shade on a blanket and read a book or take a picnic too.  but alas, freetown is too crazy for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then we wanted to see some diamond mines.  it was the ostensible reason for the trip, so we decided to do it.  we hired a motorbike taxi to lead us out to this famous place, tongo fields.  but first a sidebar.  there are two types of mining that are done in SL, the first is alluvial mining.  this is the sifting of the river that you saw in blood diamonds, over the years the diamonds work their way to the surface and then flow down the rivers.  this is done by two man crews.  the second is called kimberlite mining, this is the more traditional &amp;ldquo;mining&amp;rdquo; where there are veins which are diamond rich and the company has to bore down into the earth to get it.  this is industrial with caterpillars and dynamite etc.  if you want to read more check &lt;a href="http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/2001/pac-sie-jan00.pdf">here&lt;/a>.  tongo fields which is outside of kenema town is the largest kimberlite vein in SL.  after talking to person after person we worked our way out to tongo fields, past a couple of alluvial, artisinal mining pits and many artisinal miners.  we first had to go to the main diamond office, it was the certification people who are in charge of ensuring that the diamonds are certified as conflict free.  they work for the government.  the first guy took us to his bosses house.  the boss was having a bbq in the back yard with some friends.  there were a few beers around and a deer head on the fire pit.  i’m not kidding. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this guy took us to another guy who worked at the koidu holdings diamond mine (the big, industrial one).  that guy took us to the gate. we talked to the security gaurds and then to a policeman and then to another governmental certification guy and finally to the chief of security for the entire mine.  we weren’t able to talk our way inside, neither were we able to bribe our way inside. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>so we got back in the car as we wanted to return to bo before nightfall and had a long way to go.  had a low tire on the way home, but filled it up and luckily it held air so we kept going and made it back to the &amp;ldquo;hotel&amp;rdquo; in bo.  it wasn’t bad, similar to a shitty roadside hotel in nowhere’sville ar-kansas.  had a bit of dinner which was two small fishes bbqed over coal pit and some rice and a little salad which will likely fill me with typhoid virsuses.  then, having been up since four in the morning, i was too exhausted to stay awake to debrief for the day so i fell asleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the next morning we got up with the intention of just driving home; little did he know what adventures lay before him.  after a breakfast of toast and a fried egg and some butter we piled in the car.  this day it was my day to drive.  there were three of us who wanted to drive, urs drove the first day, jason drove the second day, and it was my turn the third day.  lynn didn’t want to drive and brett doesn’t know how to drive manual.  idiot. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>first we toured, quickly the city of bo, including a stop to put in some diesel in the tank of a land cruiser that we were driving.  also had to fill up the tire again which was still holding on, but had gone a little low over the night.  then we got a wild hair that we wanted to go see the grave of one of the warlords that was indicted by the court here and has recently died.  he is a legend and a very controversial figure b/c most SL’s think that he was the only thing that kept this country together and most of them wonder why he was indicted by the court.  that, also, is another post entirely.  but in the part of the country where we were the court is NOT liked one iota.  and here we were rocking out with a vehicle that might as well have our employer’s name posted on the side like the NGO’s that rock around here.  we figured it was stupid so why not. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>in bo we hired another motorbike taxi to take us out to this village that was &amp;ldquo;eight&amp;rdquo; miles away (read 38) down this bush road.  he led and i followed in the tank down bush road after bush road.  at one point the bush grass formed, essentially, a tunnel that i was forced to go through.  if i can get the video up here i will.  the grass was smacking the car on both sides and i have zero clue what the hell i was supposed to do if there was oncoming traffic.  luckily the only thing we saw oncoming was a few men on bikes loaded down with water and fuel jerry cans. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>we drove down the roads and got to the village where we had to turn off.  we rocked up to the police station and talked to some elders of the village that were standing outside the station, then we drove down a couple of houses to talk to the paramount chief (read..essentially…major of the county), this was the guy who replaced the legendary warlord.  after a little talking to a bunch of people and exchanges of gifts and a beer we piled an ex-combatant nephew of the warlord into the passenger seat and then surrounded ourselves with four motorbikes loaded down with the warlord’s followers for the three mile drive up to his grave.  it was a four-wheel-drive road up into the hills and it was brilliantly beautiful. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>we finally got to the warlord’s village and took pictures with his brother at his mausoleum.  then hightailed it out of there.  the nephew, who lives in freetown, asked a couple of us under his breath what our &amp;ldquo;real mission was&amp;rdquo;.  we’re pretty sure that he knew who we worked for but didn’t say anything to anyone else, or if he did, they didn’t care.  we dropped off the nephew at the bottom of the hill to continue their ceremony of the five year anniversary of his father’s death party/gathering that we had interrupted when we rolled up.  he said we were the first white people since the burial to roll out there.  very interesting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then the road, if possible, got even more hairy.  we passed by this town really, truly in the bush called yele.  there was an SDA mission there with a primary school and a secondary school.  they were actually quite large.  i thought maybe i could stop and meet someone from andrews or southern, but decided against it.  we got up the road farther and stopped in a village to confirm that we were going the correct way and asked them how much further to this one town…of course the answer was only a few miles.  SLeans are good at some things, but they are AWEFUL at distances, everything was 5 miles…even when it is 30 miles!  anyway the guy said yeah it is just up the road five miles, you go past the ferry and then you’ll see it.  i started to pull the car away and then something clicked…ferry?  so i reversed and asked him what he meant about ferry and he said that it was a town named ferry.  my heart slowed down.  that would have been too much adventure.  my foot was already getting tired from constantly shifting up and down.  i know, i know, i’m kind of a pansy, but this was 6 hours into a long bush drive where the longest i was in one gear was only a matter of minutes. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the road becomes impossible and suddenly we come up to a bridge that we think has a huge hole in it.  but it was only our perspective, actually there were logs covering the hole.  so jason got out to inspect and he thought everything was OK.  i thought, hell the drop is only 15 feet if it collapses.  everyone gets out of the vehicle save me.  i remember wondering as i drove slowly onto the bridge whether the tank had airbags or not.  luckily i never had to find out, the logs held the tanks and i got across without incident.  that, to me, was the most sketchy thing about the bush roads, what if one of the bridges we were crossing every five minutes went out.  i mean we had 4WD, but still….anyway we get on up through village after impossibly small village…all deserted b/c it was sunday and most of them (we think) were at church. then we pass through a larger town with a market, i go around a road block, down a gorge and suddenly there is a river and there is no bridge over it.  the FERRY!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the ferry is essentially a huge wooden barge and there is a cable that runs from one bank to another that the barge is clipped too.  there are men who man the barge and they manually pull it from one side to the other by tugging on the cable.  so they tug across to ourside and then the tank, us and some bike dudes drive/walk/ride onto the barge.  then the rest of them pulled her across the river…wait till you see the picts of this!  i’m not even to the hairy part of this oregon trail journey yet.  on the other side they couldn’t get the landing ramp fitted onto the bank correctly b/c there was a gigantic hole which i wasn’t going to be able to drive the tank across!  but eventually they got some logs situated and jason (who by the way works in northern canada as a manager of oil rigs and is here visiting lynn (his fiance) for a few months as they cannot really work right now while the land is defrosting) supervised it, so i felt better.  across the tank went and then up the hill.  4Low baby!  then we had good roads all the way back to freetown, rolled into town to a gorgeously clear day where the bay was glistening with the nice sunset. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>FABULOUS!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>the king &amp;amp; the texas</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-05-18-the-king-the-texas/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 May 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2007/2007-05-18-the-king-the-texas/</guid><description>&lt;p>two notes on music.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>one of the things which we were discussing is a fear that we share which is why haven’t our views been implemented before.  it got me thinking about a poem by one of my favorite poems, &lt;a href="http://www.taylormali.com">Taylor Mali&lt;/a> called &amp;ldquo;Running a Race&amp;rdquo;.  I transcribe the lyrics below, please forgive me if the line breaks are a bit off as I’m manually doing the transcription.  His CD is available on his website or the songs are available on iTunes.  Highly! Recommend!…&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>No one knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No one knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Running a race to nowhere lookin’ to share a little love along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Running a race to nowhere lookin’ to share a little love along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Running a race to nowhere lookin’ to share a little love along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Running a race to nowhere against who and not sure why, but already miles, tired, confused as to where my motivation is supposed to come from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Millions of generations before me fought unsuccessfully for the same beliefs I now stand for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With hands &amp;amp; feet bonded, speaking through duct taped lips, in an unknown language, tongue-tied with mouth full of assorted jelly bellies&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wondering how many battered voices is it going to take to make a word, a sentence, a phrase, a manifesto, to make a difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gallons of tears collected, but not enough to make a flow, my river is better defined as a puddle of piss on a sidewalk corner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But a girl has to start somewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Crying for my puddle’s preservation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Realizing that it is easier and cheaper to live in the dark, but that the brightness and warmth from lying naked without sunscreen at twleve in the sun is a pain I prefer because&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can see the ones who feel the same and are unashamed of their naked existence, trapped in their own respective concerns, blinded by the brightness, desperate in an unknown space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wishing only to grab hands with one who does to another, creating a bond formed because of this shared experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Comforting me, while I do to you, joining us in solitude, simply by the fact that –&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isolation only exists in one’s thoughts. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isolation only exists in one’s thoughts.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main thing that I ping off of is the stuff at the beginning, rather than the latter.  The communal stuff, to a certain extent, I feel that I have found.  It is not so much hands to hold it is the frustration that the holding of hands needs to occur in order to divert the river’s flow from where it currently is to where millions of others wish that it will go.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>in a city like this with a massive unemployment problem, transportation may not be as important as a highly employed population, yet those that are employed have problems getting around.  throughout the past entries i’ve made oblique references to poda podas [pronounced with a long &amp;ldquo;o&amp;rdquo; and a short &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo;].  these are mini-vans that have been stripped and replace with bench seats in rows.  they rarely have doors on them and they are brightly painted with slogans.  usually on the back windows they have &amp;ldquo;city boy&amp;rdquo; in a smattering of bright colors.  on the sides and usually below the windows in the back will be the name of the &amp;ldquo;company&amp;rdquo; that runs the poda poda, usually some variation on the &amp;ldquo;A &amp;amp; T Tours&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Touba Tours&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Sesay Tours.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the front above the grill and below the windshield are more slogans.  these, we think, are the trademarks of the particular poda poda (like naming your boat &amp;ldquo;occupational hazard&amp;rdquo; – which is a jimmy buffett song and my favorite boat name).  the slogans range from &amp;ldquo;fear me&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;fear judgment day&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;allah is great&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;all good things come in time.&amp;rdquo;  they usually have a religious theme (as that is the only thing that allows many here to retain some modicum of hope). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>where the side door usually is there will be a guy hanging out and screaming repeatedly and as fast as he possibly can where the damn thing is headed so you’ll be walking down the narrow, poorly (and british) designed streets and you’ll hear &amp;ldquo;lumlylumlylumlylumlylumly&amp;rdquo; and then probably will get honked at a couple of times.  some of the drivers trick out their poda podas even more with flashing bulbs and fancy horns. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>most of the populace packs themselves in these for a couple of cents per leg of their trip.  you see these things roll past with literally (i know i’m prone to exageration but i’m not here) over twenty people per poda poda.  all of them sit passively, accepting whatever fate (delivery, braking down, robbery, etc.) awaits them on the journey -  usually dressed beautifully and not sweating half as much as the white boy walking on the street with all the air in the world cooling him off. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there are a few big buses, but i’m not sure what they do.  there is no other system of mass transport in this city.  it is ridiculous in my mind that people have to pack in these damn poda podas.  at least they provide a lot of jobs for the driver and screamer for each vehicle, but this city essentially only has four roads for the majority of the town and why there are not regular bus routes i have no clue.  it certainly would help mobility.  if the roads were better designed bikes could also be used much easier.  it is hilly here but less hilly than sf or other hilly towns i’ve been to in california and elsewhere where people bike consistently.  so i don’t particularly get it.  bikes may be a large expenditure, sure, but i’m surprised there isn’t a bike NGO here started by some portland bike crew…there seems to be an NGO of every other flavor that i can fathom…all of them and no positive progress, mind-blowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but us rich white people?  we take charters.  poda podas are also called cabs or taxis.  charters are what we know everywhere else as cabs.  the notable things about the cabs in freetown is that most of them are driven by ex-combatants.  one of the attendant annexes to the announced peace accord (the last one of the four or two, depending upon how one counts) contained clauses that accounted cabs for combatants.  so due to this most of the time we are being driven around by ex-rebels.  makes one feel safe.  most of the time it is fine, but there have a been a few experiences, late and night with a hooker in the other front seat, me and maybe some others in the back seats looking the driver playing Salone music through shitty speakers at full volume, usually the driver is toking on some weed…i get these surreal visions of this is what is would have been like for these guys during the war…although they would have been walking and carrying an AK rather than driving, but essentially it is the same.  maybe i’m imagining, maybe i’m overly romanticizing war, maybe when the moon glistens off their black skin and bulging muscles some latent homo-eroticism arises out of my subconscious.  i don’t know.  it is fleeting, but odd.  there are a few other times when i get these surreal visions of &amp;ldquo;this is what it was like during the war&amp;rdquo; (minus the carnage), sometimes when i see someone on a dirt bike riding helmet-less and be-sun-glassed at a torrid pace through the freetown streets it happens, sometimes when we are out and i see the small big men with their women and their people it happens.  i usually have to do a double take to realign my reality to where and when i am.  after that i’m ok, but there are times when it hits harder the causes and and realities of why the war began, why it lasted so long, why it was waged the way that it was waged….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>self-righteous paragraph: all of this stokes my theories of development at &amp;ldquo;all costs.&amp;rdquo;  opportunity is what most people i’ve talked to hear want.  all else comes secondary, and if they are my age or older they’ve resigned themselves usually to a lack of opportunity but want to see it for their children.  i want to do what i can to provide these equalized opportunities allocated on a meritocritous basis for these taxicab drivers and poda poda screamers and crazy people who dare to ride their bikes to their shitty little jobs so that their children may have a chance to be a doctor or lawyer or teacher or something equally as prestigious.  whatever.  i can pat myself on the back all i want, but the bottom line is to make some positive difference in whatever my sphere of influence may be and today, so far, i haven’t so now i need to stop typing and start doing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>maybe two weeks ago some friends of ours told us of an album launch at the YSC (young sportsmen’s club).  thinking that it would be interesting i tried to get a big group of people to go.  i also invited fouday, one of my gaurds, the youngest of them, as i thought it would be a nice night out, although i conceded in my mind that he may be stygmatized by hanging out with white people, i sidelined that thought b/c i thought at the end of the day maybe i can buy his muslim ass enough sodas that he’ll be so sugar-high that maybe he won’t care.  plus it is the whole, i’m white, i want to do good b/c i feel guilty when i think about my life back home, scenario which i have found myself in more times than i can count…almost to the point of cynicism…almost.  that aside, we had a group of people to go to this thing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i had actually met the singer, Paps, at a beachside bar only a few weeks after i arrived.  brett and i went down there for a few beers and met a sort-of-friend and her two friends, one of which is this white brit 24 y/o guy and his friend, a singer: Paps.  The brit has now sunk his lifesavings (whatever that can amount to at 24) into getting Paps album off the ground. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this was to be their big night.  they had booked the place, they had booked, essentially, the entire Salone music scene in order to come out and support Paps’ album launch and then Paps was going to perform.  we got there and it was packed with locals sitting on delipidated chairs on this terrace overlooking tennis courts/basketball courts.  i met fouday and we all went in.  the entrance fee was five thousand leones and the CD was ten thousand, essentially $2 and $4.  we didn’t have to buy the cd’s, but see prior paragraph for why we all did! &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there were about seventy-eight opening acts.  at least it felt like that.  it was so interesting to see.  very communal.  people would come out to &amp;ldquo;sing&amp;rdquo; (why in quotes to come) one song, half a song, two and a half songs.  people would hop up on the stage when they would get excited or a lyric was funny.  people would cross deck and come out on other group’s songs.  we heard, essentially, the entire Salone sound track – every song which we hear every night we go out (there aren’t that many, as this place isn’t that big). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>none of this was much different than watching &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chappelles-Block-Party-Unrated-Widescreen/dp/B000FMH8RG/ref=sr_1_1/102-1712276-6191336?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;qid=1178625457&amp;amp;sr=1-1">dave chappelle’s block party&lt;/a> on showtime, laying on my nice green couch with a beer in hand…except for the sweat and the smells and the bar-b-q chicken which are spicy as hell (frying is expensive).  what WAS different than watching that is that here they only had two mic’s.  one had to stay with the MC for much of the time, but in a pinch it was passed to the performers.  the performers were always messing with the mic, for a minute i couldn’t figure out what was going on.  only after the second performer did i realize what was going on.  these guys didn’t have enough money to produce a backing track so what was happening was they were merely lip syncing.  the fiddling with the mic was them turning it off when the song started and on when it finished so they could talk/dedicate/whatever.  as opposed to when it happens in the states out of laziness or unqualification to be a performer, here it was endearing as these people probably would have loved to have people spinning the backing tracks behind them like the performers on Dave Chappelle’s special, but that simply wasn’t a possibility.  here the only option that they have is to &amp;ldquo;perform&amp;rdquo; by lip singing.  they would a capella from time to time which would be a live performance and i could tell thes few that did this were qualified and had great voices/could rap/whatever. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this experience put into sharp relief something that i had heard before on a BBC special about the history of Sierra Leone music.  Salone used to be a bastion of jazz and blues like much of the rest of west africa: mali and senegal are known for their musicians.  mali claims to be the real birthplace of the blues and senegal claims to be the afro in afro-cubano jazz, etc.  salone used to be very intrumental focused like the rest of west african, lots of drumline, crazy beats.  but since the war began this has changed for a couple of reasons (according to the BBC analysis).  one was the rampant poverty.  prior to the war there was rampant poverty, but there was a priveledged &amp;ldquo;middle-class&amp;rdquo; that was relatively better off than the majority of the populace.  i make no claims to the benefits of this type of system, however instrumental music did flourish under that system.  after the war everything was equalized, equalized downward.  everyone became poorer and suddenly it was much harder to find the $ for instruments.  the second part of it is that all of the archives of Salone music and all the musical instruments that the invaders could find were burned during the Freetown invasion in January, 1999. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the third thing that I think, this was not in the BBC analysis but is only from my superficial observation, is that b/c of the war there was a massive hardening of this society.  gang rap became a standard b/c of the psyiological responses which the rebels were able to create in their footsoldiers and thus they enticed them to fight by giving them drugs and playing tupac.  of course it is much more complex than this, but i think that american gang rap and less militant forms of hip hop took root here in a way that other west african societies seems to lack (outside of liberia which is supposedly very similar to Salone in this regard) due to the necessities of a hard civil war.  it was a coping mechanism as well as an enabling mechanism for the young and not so young soldiers.  at least it makes sense to me that that may be the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so hip hop became the standard and now what happens is that many performers record their voice tracks a capella on whatever they can find whereever they can find it and then send the tracks abroad for some producer they’ve never met, but only emailed, to put backing tracks to.  after a round or two a cd is produced and mp3′s are emailed back here for someone to burn onto a CD. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Know-Im-Not-Alone/dp/B000G8NX9G/ref=sr_1_2/102-1712276-6191336?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=dvd&amp;amp;qid=1178625377&amp;amp;sr=1-2">have heard&lt;/a> that musicians in iraq are making music along similar lines, but there the major concern isn’t so much the money as the socially imposed lack of freedom to assemble in anything other than one’s house as well as the rising fundamental muslim extremism who takes issue with hip hop generally and their music specifically. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>nevertheless i think that a more competent than i sociologist could publish a good paper following these trends.  but for now, here is Paps singing about corruption in Salone.  if you want his CD please tell me and i’ll buy here to support the artist and bring it home with me.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>i found my place, though, in the oddest of locations: dakar.  i know that many of you may be quite over my raving about dakar, but deal with it.  this place (picts coming soon right now there are technical difficulties) is amazing.  it is a little bar with a tiki hut thing in the middle of it with a small stage on the front right and just tables everywhere.  they are so relaxed about everything…the artists, the staff, the patrons.  brett at one point jumped on stage with a band and started playing the marraccas along with the band in the most arrogant and stupid and hillarious display of white-boy-ness that i’ve seen in….a long flipping time. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>although the environment was not closed and was not velvetty and was not terribly smokey given that it was open air and there were palm trees growing in the veranda/patio/open air area, the music made it almost complete.  the first night we were there we listened to &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;amp;sql=11:wpfqxqt5ldfe">orchestra baobab&lt;/a>.  they had this tenorman that i wanted to sire his children, he was so chill, so beat, so amazing.  the band was powerful with afro-cubano roots and a lot of straight jazz influence, it was improvisational, serene and over the top in its grandiosity. the second night we listened to &lt;a href="http://www.waflash.net/">waflash&lt;/a>.  she was seductive, a billy holiday of west african beats.  wonderfully relaxed, sexy environs for a nice sunday evening listen.  then the last night we heard &lt;a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;amp;sql=11:diftxqwhld0e">cheikh lo&lt;/a> who is one of the god fathers of senegalese music.  he is a drummer and a singer.  he is a rasta.  he had this nice band. he played straight senegalese music, straight west african tunes. he had crazy native dancers with him that did stuff i’ve never, ever seen the human body do. he was the spiritual leader of his entire crowd.  i drank a soda with him at via roma at 5 in the morning after his show. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>listen, listen, listen to these people.  they are all on itunes.  also the most famous godfather of them all yousou n’dour is on itunes as well.  buy all of their music. it will blow your mind. i know it is copywrite infringement and i don’t care. below is a song that could turn the grinch into mary poppins as far as i’m concerned. it is by yousou n’dour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/underwater/files/track_12.mp3">Download track_12.mp3&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>on the final night we were in dakar we were walking from just for you, the main music venue where we saw all of these people, aka my jazz bar to a place called: the jazz bar which was around the corner.  there we had heard some decent reggae and had heard that this old guitar dude was supposed to go on late…on our way i found this house half way between the two on a nice quiet street. i want it. it has joined this house in the keys that i fantasize about owning whenever i pass it as one of the houses i would give most anything to own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>dakar is THAT good. now back to talking about where i currently am: crazy, crazy Sierra Leone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1749.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1749.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isle de Goree has, at various times, been a defensive position protecting the bay where the port of Dakaar is and/or a slave exporting island.  Most times the slave traders would take slaves to islands off the coast of West Africa and then barter with the transportation people there on the island.  This was safer than doing it on the mainland as the slaves couldn’t escape back into the jungle.  Also the traders didn’t know exactly when a new ship would be coming to pick up a new load of people to take away to historical and continued oppression and exploitation. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1750_2][3]][3] So all along the coast of West Africa there are these islands.  Isle de Goree markets itself as one of these, but in truth the garrison on the island is small enough that it could only have held a small number of people, therefore the modern historical perspective on the island is that it was a slave trading post, but always a minor one. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1750_2.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1750_2.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you get to the other historical role for the island.  On the island there was a colonial era fortress, WWI cannons and WWII shore guns, all coexisting in various spots on the island.  The colonial one faced the shore, likely because their range was short and they’d want to get the ships as they were approaching the port before wasting their ammunition.  The WW guns with their further ranges were facing out to see. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![4382455][4]][4] Currently the island is a tourist trap for people wanting to reconcile the history of slavery.  But many of those people, myopic in their pilgrimage miss much of the modern beauty of the island.  Now it is full of art, which is mostly located one end of the island.  There is this one hill on the seaward side of the island that has this huge hill, it is where the WW guns are facing out to sea. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/4382455.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/4382455.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you come to the bottom of the hill you see all kinds of painted wall art.  Beautiful primary colors in traditional senegalese motifs.  It was, by far, the best art I’ve seen in Africa.  As you wind your way up the switchbacks on the side of the hill you transition slowly such that at the tip, intertwined with the bunkers of war and the desolate, abandoned guns is the junk art. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1743][5]][5] Along the way you meet may rastafarians and other truly hip people that live on this island.  Most of the guys who make the junk art at the top of the hill live in the bunkers under the guns and they all have one teacher: the professor.  The professor sold me a piece of work that is going to go to Brian. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1743.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1743.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is the most truly beat place I’ve ever been, Isle de Goree.  I have often wondered if Kerouac and Cassady and the rest were alive today where would they be?  Would modern transportation possibilities have altered their fascination with America and their intention to dominate it by seeing all of it?  I’m not sure. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1754][6]][6]I think that at a minimum it would have tightened their cycles such that everything would happen faster, they would have gotten bored faster since they would have been able to see many things quic ker.  So I think that many of them may have focussed outside the US.  But maybe not.  Nevertheless, if they did, I think many of them would have dug the beat characters that I found on the Isle. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1754.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1754.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if I could just find a willing art dealer in the states I could start my own import business of Senegalese art.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>~ # ~&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK, well there is lots to say.  Many of the stories from the trip are embedded in the pictures in the album.  I will give the highlights of each day here if you are really interested…Will flush out a couple of the themes in here through the next week!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 1: Arrive, harassed at airport as per norm, put foot down with harassor, cab ride to hotel, drinks at posh lounges.  Approached by many beautiful women who spoke no English.  Not interested in engaging in the services of the oldest profession.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 2: Get up to nice breakfast of Patisseries and COFFEE that wasn’t instant.  Wonderful eggs, a bit of great cheese. Head off for the markets, heartily disappointed, almost pickpocketed.  Find a quiet Chocolaterrie, drink a Yogurt milkshake thing. Happy. Walk to an art gallery. Finally find African art worth more than a one second glance. Stare at a beautiful exhibit of faces of West African artists, poets, sculptors, etc. Find a pub have a beer. Back to the hotel for siesta. Watch sunset over Daakar on our terrace eating good cheese on proper baguette and drinking Senegalese wine.  All of this sentence is highly recommended save for the word Senegalese…take that word out of the sentence and the scene would have been close to perfect.  Dress for Thai garden.  Eat to a chant of frogs. Find jazz at Just for You (first of three nights out of four in Daakar to be here). Listen to Orchestra Boubab. Realize that I’ve found the jazz place I’ve searched for my entire life. Beyond happy. Rhum. Dancing under some tree on the beach surrounded by people who speak no English save for my friends. Bed at about 6.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 3: Arise (finally). Eat. Go to Isle de Goree. Amazed by the craziest, hippest, most wonderful artistic community I’ve ever seen. Run out of money but promise to return to buy art. Eat at a romantic place with Brett as my date and Urs and Rosio as our double date. Wish highlands was there with me. Return to the mainland, return to Just for You. Listen to a crazy Senegalese version of Billy Holiday/Nina Simone. Realizations of Day 2 re: this place are fully confirmed. Bed at a reasonable 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 4: Arise. Hassled/Haggle. Four hour long-distance cabbie drives us to Saint-Louis in the northeast corner of Senegal. Check into hotel where Frenchy airmail pilots stayed a long time ago.  Eat amazing lobster ravioli in a pink sauce. Find good live music in a random courtyard where someone was selling beers. Turns out they were Gunean and not Senegalese, I didn’t hold it against them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 5: Walk around the island. Take tons of pictures. Siesta by the pool. Read. Eat a marginal dinner. Find average live music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 6: Walk over the bridge to the fishing village side of the river. Take lots of pictures of kids. The crazy thing was how excited and happy and non-hassly they were. Once you took their picture they only wanted to see themselves. I was happy to oblige. Walked through the markets smelled wonderful treats such as skinned goats hanging in the heat surrounded by flies. Ate Boubab root. Not awful. Walked to Mauritania. Walked back to Senegal. Took a horse-cart to Mauritania. Felt like Jesus as I entered Boiyo. Then I was harassed by the border guards. Wondered if I would get my passport back without bribing anyone…didn’t, but I did get my passport back. Horse-cart back to Senegal. Watch boring soccer game. Eat something memorable, except cannot quite remember right now. Hear this crazy acapella guy who would create soundscapes by looping sounds that he had made and layering each on top of the other.  He was crazy. And magnificent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 7: Walk over to the mainland side of the river. Very middle Class over there. Take a Senegalese Poda-Poda. Crazy. Eat african food. Almost get taken for a ride by a taxicab driver until he screws up. Buy antique Mauritanian daggers without considering whether I’ll be able to transport them across international borders. Meet African German teacher who is in love with one of his students.  Walk back as the sun sets. Do some yoga. Eat. Drink. Relax. Read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 8: Drive back to Daakar. Settle in. Eat. Drink. Back to Just for You. Cheik Lo is playing. We stay. This guy was the most truly beat guy I’ve ever met. Crazy! All above is confirmed. Meet insane traditional Senegalese dancers and their choreographer. Go to Via Roma to hang with them. Music is beyond loud, all the Senegalese are dancing their dances. Us white people were sitting there.  To bed at 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 9: Brett woke me up by moving his bed around on the linoleum floor to find his shorts at about 10. Hungover but not too badly. Breakfast alone. Meet up with others after wandering around lost looking for their posh hotel pool to meet them. Finally find them. Place is crazy. Surrounded by white people. Felt weird. Left after a dip to Isle de Goree. Two main artists remember and were pleased at my return. Buy MUCH artwork. Fantasize about becoming a Senegalese importer of art as I watch the sunset from the hill on the island while sitting with a bunch of rastas and not talking for an hour or something. Back to Daakar. Dinner at crazy African place, realize Sierra Leonean food isn’t so bad in comparison to traditional Senegalese food. Back to lounge bars for a quiet night. End up in bed at 5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Day 10: Up at 6:30. HUNGOVER. Don’t really remember the cab ride, or checking in. Start coming to on the plane. End up in Sierra Leone. My friends took the ferry (slow), I took the helicopter as I needed a bit of space from them. Come off the helicopter with bags in hand, satisfied with my adventures. Struck that SL sort of felt like home.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>senegal, from what i can tell, is a mecca for tourists who desire adventure, good music, good food, maybe a pick-pocketing here and there, cafes, bookstores and the beach.  i crave all of the above.  but mostly i’m looking forward to being able to run up my credit cards even higher!  here i am limited by a completely cash based economy.  there, i’ll be able to ruin my credit rating further!  sa-WEET. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>but malls in africa are different. there are two markets in freetown. i have written about those earlier. i guess what i’m describing in this post is more like the grocery store. but, for the most part, everything that my soap boxing deals with is applicable to grocery stores. except for the fact that i do, in fact, go to those without bitching and moaning like a child who doesn’t want to go ski.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>almost every evening i walk out the gate of my compound and down the dirt road towards king street.  sitting along this road is lance.  he sits in his second story balcony looking out onto frazier-davies dr (which is the dirt road, off king street). usually if i go early they are praying, his building is sort of an all-purpose store, mosque, residence.  it is odd that lance is rarely not outside.  when it is dark it is even more odd, b/c he will just be sitting there.  i often wonder what old lance is thinking about.  regardless, he is always friendly to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![240207_1659][3]][3]king street is narrow and fairly steep. when two cars pass each other, you want to have nothing to do with that. the ditches are deep on either side of king street and sidewalks are a luxury that only the cotton tree foundation (some sort of an educational NGO, but i personally think is a front for some tax right-off from the developed world as it is the nicest house on king street but none of my guards or the locals that i now know in the area have seen anyone going into the cotton tree foundation complex…they also keep it lit up like a beacon of misplaced hope at night, which is pleasant for me as there are no street lights on king street.) can afford.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/240207_1659.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/240207_1659.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the tenuous part is not only the fact that the ditches are really quite deep and filled with sewage, but also the fact that when it is really dark and the taxicab drivers are incompetant and always have their brights on, so the effect is that your night vision is constantly getting fucked with and when you look down to see where the ditch has gone to now you cannot see your feet b/c the rods and cones are dazzled by the brilliance of the taxicab driver’s incompetence. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![240207_1701][4]][4]king street is steep, but not too bad. if you make it down to the bottom (~300 meters) you reach congo cross.  congo cross is the marker by which we tell all cabbies how to get us home.  everyone knows it.  during the freetown invasion of 1999 the bridge over the congo river was the demarcation line where the nigerian troops that were ostensibly defending the democratically elected government (for better or worse) made their stand.  most things west of that bridge stayed relatively safe (save for some minor insurgent activity), and east of that bridge it was completely and utterly fucked. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/240207_1701.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/240207_1701.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in utter freetown style, however, the congo cross roundabout which everyone knows as congo cross is a mile from where the bridge actually goes over the bridge.  the roundabout has some creepy statute on it, which i’ll have a pict for you shortly.  it is also the worst designed roundabout i’ve seen in a long time.  i think they may have imported the DC urban planners to create that flippin’ round about.  traffic is continually congested along king street heading down towards congo cross (see first pict) and if i head home on the seven o’clock transport (which, lately, has been more rare) when i walk down king street there is a line of polio victims asking for &amp;ldquo;small, small.&amp;rdquo;  usually i have a little something, but more usually when i return i give them something tangible, like bread or fish. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![240207_1703][5]][5]congo cross is a festival of sounds. people yelling, cops &amp;ldquo;directing traffic&amp;rdquo; (which is really an excuse to get the cabbies to give them money), whistles, horns, beeps of the pimped out cabs and &amp;ldquo;poda poda’s&amp;rdquo; (more about this freaks later), kids running around and laughing, usually people are singing in one of the seven churches that are within earshot of the roundabout. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/240207_1703.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/240207_1703.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i usually start by going all the way across the roundabout to bah the egg man, usually i have to spend a few minutes joking with his friends ibrahim and cherry pie (my nickname for a name that i cannot pronounce, plus the day i first met him he was wearing a red shirt, and he hates the nickname, becuase it sounds too effiminate to him…therefore i continually do it…often time accompanied by a little rendition of the song). from bah i buy most of the staples, eggs, crackers, bisquits (the british version, not the southan version), etc.  then i start working my way up the street to the left.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>next stop is aunty may who sells me my grapefruits and mangos.  she likes to try to stiff me, jokingly giving me half my change and then pretending to walk away. she turns around, however, too early…this is b/c she is old and only has enough energy to take the joke so far.  she is always one of the most appreciative traders about the fact that i come down with my own bag and i don’t need a &amp;ldquo;plastic.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![240207_1704][6]][6]next stop is usually alex, the bread man.  the bread here is really good, but you have to buy it fresh as they don’t use any preservatives, so at most they will keep fresh for a day or 36 hours from when i buy them.  though younger than i, alex has a gigantic tumor on the side of his head.  it looks like a portobello mushroom growing out of his right cheek.  i’m not sure what it is, but when joe comes (another story entirely, but JOE IS COMING…end of may) i’ll introduce them. maybe, but doubtfully, there is something joe could do for him. jared, likely could do something for him, being that jared is a face surgeon and all, but not sure jared can or would want to come.  alex is a quiet man who unfortunately has his stall sited at the end of the row of traders. not sure why i started buying bread from him, but i like him and whenever the others try to sell to me, i just shake my head…by now they know not to even ask.  i’m loyal to ole’ alex…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[![240207_1705][7]][7]after alex i have one more stop. the kwality store (yes, it is spelled phonetically). the kwality store is run by mohammed, who is a lebanese. there is a lebanese mafia around here that runs most of the high level trading (which is why i prefer to do as much shopping at the local stalls as i can, and only like to go to the real grocery stores for things i cannot buy at the stalls, like cheese and pasta and decent shampoo…this way my money stays in the country AND doesn’t fund hezbollah). i’m ok buying from mohammed though because he just has a small store, not gigantic.  from mohammed i buy any canned goods i need (especially tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, which aren’t as good out of the can, but won’t give me typhoid) and bottles of water and sodas.  every night i buy my gaurds sodas. prince likes &amp;ldquo;GinGA BEEr&amp;rdquo; which he nearly screams, because he get so excited about it. prince likes these strawberry shake things. ibrahim and francis are boring and take cokes. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>after that then i trudge up king street loaded down with the day’s worth of groceries and happy. i love talking to the people. i love the way at first they were confused about this white boy who actually walks around, but now they are getting used to my visits. i love how the people that aren’t used to me like to call me &amp;ldquo;white boy&amp;rdquo; and i say, &amp;ldquo;wow, you are quite observant&amp;rdquo; and then the people that do know me laugh….see mom…sarcasm IS the international language!  when i get up to the white international school sign (see pict 5) and take a left i’m usually sweaty and itchy (there are so many toxins in the air that whenever my pores open i get a bit itchy). b/c there is no air in the kitchen by the time i finish cooking and eating i may have stopped sweating….but not always.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i work now.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>before i knew the backstory, i viewed this mainly as another skunk-on-the-make album, more tomcatting tunes from the mack daddy of alt-rock/soul. his persona — which, from what i know of him, extends into real life — is that sort of self-pitying compulsive lover-boy who alternately agonizes over and revels in his evilness. fairly irresistible on record; doubtless a nightmare to deal with in reality. but, as someone once said, &amp;ldquo;half the records in my house are made by people i wouldn’t &lt;em>let into&lt;/em> my house.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>all is well in africa.  tunes are cranking.  work is cranking.  i’ll have a nice story for you today or tomorrow.  last night we went to this bar that reminded me strikingly of key west, and i’m not sure why.  it was more than the reggae.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I was in the Marine Corps, we had a saying that there were no bad Marines, simply bad leaders.  It is was a bit self-deprecating of Marine officers to take all the blame for psychotic Marines and their actions, but it is one of the many things that make the USMC such a great organization.  We tempered the saying when we were around the Marines who were trouble by calling them &amp;ldquo;leadership challenges.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![140207_0804][3]][3]since i’ve been here my dreams have been riddled with USMC references.  this, i’m sure is due to a lot of things.  not the least of which is the larium which turns my dreams most nights into a kaliedoscopic cinema that i never experience without drugs. usually, i rarely think about the marine days.  in a lot of ways i have closed that part of my life off.  there was a lot to it.  it made me, for better or worse, the human i am today. but i’ve moved on mentally and philosophically.  and yet i keep dreaming with references to those times and those feelings that i experienced during my nine year interaction with that institution.  much of it, i’m sure is that i’m an intern at a war crimes tribunal working a case that is in the pre-trail stages.  all i do all day long is read about war. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/140207_0804.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/140207_0804.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![160207_0813][4]][4] but there is another reason, i think as well.  that is that i’m forced to use a lot of the leadership techniques that i developed as a marine officer.  the help around the house is not that much different than an infantryman and, frankly, dealing with my &amp;ldquo;staff&amp;rdquo; (for lack of a less pejorative term i’ll rest on that term) feels the same.  i think those three things all cut towards having lots of USMC references in my dream-scape.  but i’ve rattled too much, now to the introductions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>first there is martha (spelled, pronounced like a rasta would say matter…ma-TA).  she runs the entire show.  she cleans, washes, coordinates everything.  a couple of months before we arrived she had a baby.  after she got pregnant her b/f left her.  she, apparently, didn’t care.  she was just so happy to have a child on the way, b/c before this latest b/f she was married for a few years and could not concieve.  she was shunned by her family and his. finally they got divorced, citing the lack of children as the primary reason.  so when she became pregnant, finally, she felt vindicated of everything people had spoken about her.  she told me that she didn’t even care when her b/f left her.  she named her daughter blessing.  i named her story, bible-esque.  blessing is quiet…i have yet to hear an african baby cry, not once, they seem to have the silent resolve of everyone around here bred rather than beat into them…and cute as can be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![240207_1706][5]][5]next there is ibrahim, our caretaker.  we have settled on a supervision scheme wherein i’m responsible for supervising the outside the house guys and another housemate is responsible for the inside the house ladies.  so far, it is working out fine.  ibrahim is not a bad guy, but he is lazy.  again, no different than all the marines i knew.  he pressed me at the beginning of when i took over supervision of him. when i called him out and corrected him, he fell in line just fine.  i am very clear and precise with him. i don’t ask a lot out of his cognizance. and it is fine.  we haven’t had a single issue with him not being around or available or not meeting a deadline since i’ve taken over responsibility.  a little hands on goes a long ways. ibrahim has a wife and a three y/o son, but he stays many nights at the house.  he is honest and i would trust him with nearly anything i own, which is good b/c he carries a keyring full of every key to every door in the house!  he speaks quite good english, and sometimes has to work as my krio interpreter.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the next pict is of patricia.  patricia is the cook for one of our housemates.  she doesn’t cook for brett and i, but we are thinking of hiring her for a little while.  our housemate is leaving for a few weeks to return to the states and patricia is the only breadwinner for her family that has three boys.  unfortunately her husband was recently laid off due to lack of work (i’m not sure what he did).  her boys come with her as they go to school down the street.  they are 11, 8, and 6.  also very cute and respectful little dudes.  i get a kick out of them.  my main interactions with patricia are as my krio (pronounced similar to creole, only faster and lazier) teacher.  every morning she teaches me some new krio or reminds me of what i forgot that she told me the day before. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>finally we get to &amp;ldquo;the boys.&amp;rdquo;  unfortunately i only have a picture of one of the boys, fouday (pronounced &amp;ldquo;foodie&amp;rdquo;).  that is him sitting outside the gate to our compound reading his textbooks and waiting for me to come back from the market with his coke.  we have three night gaurds that rotate.  each night only two of them are on. we have one main day guard, and one that comes during his days off.  the day guard i rarely get a chance to talk to, as mornings are usually filled with me telling ibrahim what i need him to do during the day and other errands.  the night, guards, however i’ve gotten fairly close to.  they call me school teacher, b/c they say when i’m talking to them i adopt these speech patterns that remind them of a lecturer.  it is the only way i know how to talk so that they can understand, though. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>fouday is in college studying to be an accountant.  he is a wily little one, but friendly and trustworthy.  frankly he is the only one of the bunch that has any initiative.  he was the second person in his constituency to register to vote when that started earlier this week.  he is in school every morning and works for us at least five nights a week.  he tells me he has a girlfriend, but the others aren’t so sure as no one has been able to see this young lady before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>francis. oh francis.  i wish i had a picture of him, as he is a piece of work!  francis is the most emotional non-french-man i’ve ever met. in fact he might be the most emotional man i’ve ever met.  when he talks, he talks EXACTLY like a southern baptist preacher talks. exactly. and yet i can never understand what the fuck he is saying.  he has the most distinct krio accent of any of them.  i still can usually only make out the gist of what he is saying, so most of his nuances are lost on me.  francis’s twin sister just passed away two days ago and he will be up-country for a couple of days for the funeral.  she died giving birth, and the baby is currently living, but mama has passed on.  it is really sad and horrible.  but it is life here.  francis told me earlier this week (pre-sister’s death, when happy francis was with us) that he was reserving who to vote for in the election until god spoke to him.  he said we have no president, god is our president, only He can lead us…or something to that effect, again, the nuances are usually lost.  i thought that he hadn’t been told by his preacher who to vote for yet…but will be soon! francis is very religious (obviously). he is also very superstitious. his father is what is called a paramount chief of Bo district, in the eastern part of the country (here they divide up the chiefdoms, which are presided over by chiefs (think counties) and then districts, which are presided over by paramount chiefs (think states) and has seven wives.  francis is one of 19 (i think) children of his father. 19. shit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and finally there is prince.  prince is shorter than the other guys and he always wears this chicago bulls winter cap. i always tease him about how hot it is here and why the hell is he wearing that hat.  prince was really quiet when we first arrived. in fact the first full night i was here i went out to visit with the guards and he was reading Gone With the Wind under a light near the gate.  he didn’t really talk for the first two weeks, but now he is opening up.  he and i talk about the stars.  he comes from a village in the northern part of the country.  he told me about eclipses and how nothing good comes after them.  he told me of the few african constellations. he finished Gone with the Wind and I gave him a book that I brought over about the CIA setting up the Shah in the 50′s in Iran.  he really likes it so far. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>well that is it for now. the introductions are made and now i can speak about them without making the requisite backstory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>at first i was unsure if i was simply experiencing the pangs of homesickness, but i realized quickly that it wasn’t that.  the sense of loss was for something that may or may not have ever existed. a time, a place, a series of events that may have been real or may have been imagined.  my feels were not so external to be able to characterize them as homesickness.  i became unsure if it was so internal as to be my three month, cyclical existential crisis as to what the fuck am i doing with my life.  it is too early for that to be the case, i just went through it.  it was somewhere in between external and internal catalysts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i missed something, there was a distinct sense of loss, but for what? i couldn’t tell, or at least i couldn’t identify it.  everything was mushed together: a crushed pot-pie of thoughts and ideas, of visions and plans.  some will come to fruition and some are lost.  some things were more poignant than others, some problems seemed to crush me and some seemed acceptable or at least cope-able.  then i started wondering about the foreboding nature of the conclusions i was drawing based upon my thoughts.  nothing is that fatalistic, good can still be accomplished.  sometimes it may require a certain amount of subrogation, nevertheless i guess that is what is supposed to happen.  action and inaction, are different sides of the same coin, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it struck me, as i rode with some friends in a small boat down to the beach that i visited five weeks ago, how little time i’ve spent here.  sometimes it seems like a long time, but mostly it feels like i just arrived.  objectively i’m a quarter of the way through my original contract, which ends the end of june.  i wonder how in the hell i’m 25% completed?  i just arrived.  i’ve been here such a small amount of time.  my feet are barely dry from the states.  where has it gone? i still cannot get access to some of the dataBases at work, and yet i’m tracking towards some sort of return at some point in the future. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the boat was not always up to the waves thrown at it during portions of the hour and a half trip and a few of the Brits (good, sea-faring people that they are) felt it necessary to put on life jackets.  yet, i wondered why they felt it was necessary to don them since shore was no more than a 100 meters away, 200 at most.  i refused. the waves weren’t that big, but the boats here ride low to the water and so maybe the magnitude gets magnified.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i read for a while at the beach and could not focus on the now for thoughts of the past.  it was a history book and i could not help but think about the parrallels to &amp;ldquo;our current situation with that camel fucker in iraq,&amp;rdquo; as well as other current situations on a world-wide scale.  why do we get involved with things only to fuck them up?  why do we stubbornly stick around and take all the blame from the media when most of may be accurate and, yet, most of it is truly reactionary? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i became tired.  tired of my book, tired of my uncertainties, tired of wondering, tired of planning, tired of caring so damn much about too many fucking things without being able to express or do anything about any of it, tired of making myself feel guilty about everything done and undone and redone and not-done, tired of feeling good and bad about myself, tired of looking forward and back and down and up, tired.  so i took a nap and got sunburned.  which is ok and — likely — symbolically accurate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i came home and later went to the one place where i can have introverted moments.  a small hotel within walking distance of my house where no expats go.  african big men from around the sub-region come to smoke cigars and talk geo-politics.  i wondered when i left if they would think i am a spy.  which would be awesome.  maybe i now have a tail and don’t know it.  which would also be awesome.  i sat and watched the sun set to my left and began again to wonder about the seasonal and daily oscillations and whether i’m destined to continue or whether i can ever actually get them under control.  i wondered if anything was ever going to be able to be reconciled within my head?  would my desires (long-term, medium-term, short-term) ever align?  or have i created a situation that has judged me guilty and set me on a continually self-perpetuating cycle of … of what?  i don’t know, but it all cycles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i walked home and thought about the tension, do i look up?  everyone around here keeps their head up.  not sure if it is because they are so used to carrying things on their head, or if the social norms dictate that you not look down, or if it is a pride thing.  yet, at home i always watch were i’m going on a more specific and less general level.  this has been a skill that serves me well here where the ditches are random and deep and filled with sewage, where the potholes will break your ankle, even while walking, and where the puddles are likely filled with parasites of unthinkable (to me) voracity. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>and yet i don’t know if i’m supposed to look down at where i’m going or up at where i’m going?  am i supposed to look behind me or look ahead and wait for a car or a light to illuminate the shadows of those walking behind me? is it easier to assess their probability of picking my pocket by pretending to not pay attention while keeping aware of their presence, or should i really turn around and assess from a proper perspective?  but at any rate it is usually moot because they couldn’t really care less if i was there or not and they just pass me as i walk at my new-found Africa pace, which is to say…slow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i stopped along the way and helped some men push a dead taxi cab a long ways.  they were amazed that i did it, but thankful for the extra set of legs which were not as strong as their’s, but helpful to some extent.  it put a few things in perspective: the exertion (it was a long ways).  yet, i cannot quite put a finger on what perspective or what things they were.  at least i could see a bit clearer, the fog wasn’t so deep.  i thought of my heritage and how pushing cars and visions of my dad have affected both my perspective and my trajectory.  have i chosen this perpetual longing for something unattainable, or is my climb up the sand dune not my choice, some wierd conflagration of nature and nurture combined to explode in my head like a chemistry experiment gone bad? i certainly could have chosen not to help them push the car, but what would my heritage think about that?  is it better to regret doing or to regret cowardice or to regret both or to not regret at all? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>today? today i cannot concentrate and feel the fog is pervasive. i have been asked questions, serious questions, and am getting them all convuluted.  all of the answers are swirling and i am having difficulty putting together which answer fragment goes with which question. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>maybe i just need some ritalin.  that seems to cure everything, right?  maybe i just need to figure out my entire life.  maybe i just need to stop caring.  maybe i just need to realize that tensions will always exist, without them life would be much more boring.  or maybe, that like two fingers squeezing a slimy watermelon seed, pressure is the only way to move forward, and i should revel that when the fog clears a path may be slightly clearer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In some ways it may be easier to hide and protect a witness in a developing country.  The lack of a virtual or real paper-trail may make certain things, such as identity creation, easier.  The lack of credit cards and the imposition of a completely cash based economy also enhances anonymity.  Without having to change credit cards and bank accounts and deeds to property and all the other bread-crumbs of identity that a normal person in the developing world leaves throughout their virtual and real travels, it is easier to make someone reappear.  It may raise eyebrows if someone pays for a plane ticket in cash in the US; whereas, here it is impossible to pay for something with a credit card.  That said, once authorities get the new identity created, it is likely about the same in either a cash-based or in a credit-based economy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Around here compounds are frequent.  This, again, enhances an authority’s ability to protect “insider” witnesses who are genuinely worried about reprisals for their cooperation with investigations and trials.  In a situation where there are not many compounds, emplacing one may raise more eyebrows than in a place like this where everyone who can afford it lives in a compound and everyone who cannot lives in a shack.  There is no in between.  Either you have a wall topped with razor wire or broken glass, with bars on your windows, massive locks on your doors and guards at your gates or you live in a shack hopefully near the streams so you can do your washing easily.  When I was a child riding my bike around and saw a walled place, I would find a way to look inside.  Here the compounds are so frequent that I cannot imagine that I would have bothered to care as a Sierra Leonean child.  This prevalence of security areas makes it easier to protect someone. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in some ways the absence of a real infrastructure and large middle class make it easier for authorities to make someone disappear (in a good way, not in the other way).  Yet there are other ways which make it more difficult to make someone disappear. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>To a certain extent the developing world’s connectedness has created a situation where it is dislocated from its real environment and surroundings.  At home I rarely, if ever, talk to my neighbours or know the people I’m passing as I walk around.  Here I’m forced to learn the faces for security reasons and because it is construed as rude if I do not remember them from the last time we chatted.  Because I’m an anomaly and because everyone looks at the white boy who walks to the market every night and remembers my name, I feel socially compelled to remember as many of their names as I can.  My lack of anonymity stems from more than merely my skin color, though.  It also comes from the fact that here people have absolutely nothing to divert them.  I see the same people every night when I walk to the market because they, unfortunately, have nowhere else to go, and thus, are semi-imprisoned in their own surroundings. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lack of movies, TV, electricity, book stores, parks &amp;amp; concerts means that people are left to talk — communicating and gossiping is about all you are left with when the other diversions are absent and your work is finished for the day.  The lack of the diversions simultaneously restricts the options that local people here have to talk about.  It is a running joke in my office that Americans talk about movies too much, but that is all we know; here all people know is other people.  This human connectedness, I think, may make it more difficult to provide useful and true witness protection.  It may be easier to create a persona by moving to a different locale in the third world.  The problem is that secrets, once out, spread through the bush quicker than Page Six could ever hope to move rumours about celebrities. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>People love their news here.  It is likely their only source of diversion or break from the monotony of their normal workaday.  There are radio stations.  During the evening you can hear the five stations blasting through cheap, imported radios wherever you are in Freetown.  During the mornings you can see the cheap newspapers sold by the men who have very little else to do with their lives for US$.30 or so.  These newspapers are habitually and blatantly wrong about so many things.  Here, I think that the media can be easily cajoled.  Because corruption is so rife the people with an end in mind can further that by paying off newspapermen.  A little money goes a long way. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where there is a dearth of reliable or contradictory evidence than, of course, people will take it at face value.  People do that in the states where they have much better access to “alternative” media outlets.  In terms of witness protection, this likely cuts both ways.  I think that whoever gets their hands in the pockets of the newspaper editors in the city of relocation first will be the ones who will be able to control whether it makes it into the media that this person has arrived in the city (with a picture), the reliance on media may prevail and it may be extraordinarily easy for the seekers to find the individual.  If the authorities can pay off the newspaper first so that there is no mention of the sought-after witness then the lack of alternatives may prevail and it would be fairly easy to retain the anonymity. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what is the answer?  Maybe the answer is different here than in developed countries.  My notion of witness protection in the US is, concededly tainted by Hollywood notions, but it seems to me that you achieve a new identity and then assurances of that anonymity by becoming part of the masses.  By just being another schlub who drives a Ford Explorer and goes to work five days a week, the mall on Saturday and the golf course on Sunday no one will ask questions.  The people who may be looking for retribution will not really be able to ask a lot of questions if someone lives in a medium-size city and varies where he or she shops and goes to.  The lack of human connections makes it much harder to track someone down by human intelligence measures.  In distinction to this, in the developing world maybe you have to remove someone from the masses.  These people exist here and no one really knows who is behind the blacked out glass.  I think that the trick boils down to removing the witness from the scene entirely and not allowing him or her to be seen by many people.  The curiosity factor is high, but generally people cannot be bothered to care if you don’t give them a reason to do. &lt;/p>

Africa&lt;/p>
&lt;p>.  I would hedge for a couple of reasons.  The first is that, of course, I’m not stranger to beaches.  Something would be hard-pressed to pass up the beach on the Navy Base in
Key West&lt;/p>
&lt;p>or the beach near Sunshine Key or 1000 Steps in
California&lt;/p>
&lt;p>.  The second is that, I’m not even sure what that phrase means.  Usually I hate getting wrapped around minor semantical differences.  I really am not bagging on the verbiage choices, what I mean is that I don’t understand how one could even make the claim?  What would one base it upon?  Sand/Surf/Beer/People/No-People/Views? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1265][3]][3] It is amorphous, because each of these things seemingly has an ideal on the spectrum that a beach, were it personified in a blog, should strive for.  White, sandy beaches. Clear Water.  Consistent good weather.  But there are other categories which the ideal cannot as easily be classified.  It depends on whether one wants people around or deserted in order to classify an ideal.  It depends on whether one wants a bar and restaurant on the beach or not in order to classify an ideal.  Nevertheless this beach was pretty damn kool.  Around the corner from where this picture runs out was a little lagoon that was gorgeous.  I went around the corner and there was a woman walking topless with her back to me.  I turned around to be polite and as I was turning saw her boyfriend.  I felt bad for interrupting their quiet time. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1267][4]][4]So I went and played among the rocks that you can see at the far left of this photo, all the while singing a Jimmy Buffett song, &amp;ldquo;I’m a tidal pool explorer….from the days of my mis-spent youth….&amp;rdquo;  After I saw them returning to the main area of the beach I went to explore.  I saw a hut with a grass roof that was not built by Disney for ambiance but was really functional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These two little girls were very cute.  They came and sat next to us for a while and just looked at us.  Later we asked them what they were doing, etc.  They wanted our beer cans so they could melt them down into pots for cooking.  It was the second time this past week that I was asked for cans in order to melt them down for a pot.  A friend was wondering if it is a smart thing to melt these down for pots, wouldn’t one get poisoned slowly with all the additives in the aluminum cans.  I replied that here they likely crave things that can kill you slowly, b/c there are so many that can kill you quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1273][5]][5]For one thing we were the only white people on the beach (or as the locals pronounce it: BEEtch, which half the time I think they are calling me a bitch, a nice repose from the normal honky or white boy accompanied by a hissing sound that here is equivalent to hey, or excuse me, or a wave in america).  For another thing the water was clean and the surf made swimming a joy.  I think that the salinity of the water here seems different, at times it seems more salty and at others less salty.  Likely this is just a perception thing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1272][6]][6]The [area around Freetown][6] is a peninsula.  We have been going to the series of beaches that is along the southern part of the peninsula for a while now.  We went to the closest one first and have been working our way out further and further.  This week we went to Kent, Sierra Leone which was the farthest out.  It was the end of the line so to speak.  Our systematic beach-ride-mooching has left one beach yet to visit.  Likely we will go there next weekend.  That beach is the most famous beach in all of Sierra Leone, River Number Two.  We’ll have a review for you soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1279][8]][8]S/L still has the lowest life expectancy of any country in the world.  Mainly this stems from much of the country having very little access to healthcare in much of the country.  Even in Freetown access is extremely limited for much of the population.  Although people can get themselves or their unhealthy loved one to the clinic, there are major issues with the cost of health care in this country.  For instance, I am concerned that if I get sick it will blow my entire budget.  I have heard unconfirmed reports that a night in the Chinese run hospital will cost around $300.  Now, i’m not living on a complete shoe string here, but without real health insurance getting typhoid and getting laid up in a hospital for three nights like one friend did could be disasterous.  Think about the person who lives on $80 a month. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1266][9]][9] On top of the cost is the actual care given.  There is no level one trama facility in the entire country.  So GWB can forget about coming. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a friend, Sam, who is the executive director for a coalition of faith-based health clinics throughout the country.  He has told me that in order for this country to &amp;ldquo;develop&amp;rdquo; (whatever that means will depend on one’s perspective) it has to have better access to health-care.  Duh.  But I’m not really sure how you do it.  The problems extend from the infrastructure to the care-givers (who I’m told generally cannot be bothered to help sick people) to the cost and the web grows from there.  But maybe it is low on the government’s wishlist, it seems that when you cannot get any power through the lines to your capital city maybe the people’s political platform is slightly skewed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you have medical skills and want to make a massive impact, come visit Sam…he’ll put you to work!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/100207_1802.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/100207_1802.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but i still didn’t have a clear picture of what the hell was going on.  when we got there the tour guide told us that it was really a rehabilitation center for chimps who had been orphaned and then kept as pets.  usually they were found by people or the authorities and usually they were malnourished and neglected.  apparently the charm of having your own ape wears out fairly quickly for the expats and locals that pay $40 for one.  $40 can you imagine?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the center quarantines the chimps for three months and then slowly integrates them into the five distinct social groups they have on the campus.  the eldest group is in a 15 acre enclosure.   the youngest is in a 5 acre enclosure.  there are a couple in between.  the place seems to take good care of their 85 apes with three squares a day and the like.  the standard joke around is that the chimps live better than the average sierra leonian.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i have posted the pictures, but i don’t really have any analysis for you.  the place was interesting to just watch.  i would have prefered if it was really a national park, but maybe next time. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![100207_0011][3]][3] in other news we went to a party up at the european council.  in these smaller countries the EU is establishing, essentially, consolidated embassies for the EU countries.  it makes some sense, especially in post-colonial countries.  although there is a possibility for it to salve some colonial wounds, i think it actually salts them.  here there is the british high commission and the EC.  those are the only embassies i’ve seen from europe.  i think that it serves to reinforce the colonialism here b/c the EC is small and out of the way, the BHC is large, magnificent and in the middle of it all.  anyway, the picture above is from that party where they had a burning pile of liquor where you would dip your finger in it and then put your firey finger in your mouth.  it was hot.  and then my friend claimed she didn’t see it so i had to do it again. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>[![Imgp1156_1_1][2]][2]&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/imgp1156_1_1.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/imgp1156_1_1.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i have been asked to post some pictures of where i live.  consider that done.  we have four (total) flatmates that live in an old, square house that looks out over the ocean.  i have shown you the views from my personal balcony before.  this first picture is of the living room.  the furniture is old, and not really that comfortable, but it looks quite nice i guess.  at least i was impressed upon first viewing.  there is a large cabinet that houses our small tv and tempestuous dvd player. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>off to the right of the picture is where the dining room and kitchen are.  off to the left of the picture is where the main entrance is (looking down the main entrance from the landing is picture number 2).  last pictures are of my room which is at the top of the stairs, first one on the right.  it is kind of small and when i first moved in everything seemed to break at first touch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1155_1][3]][3] the first time i went to check the water in the shower the hot water handle fell off, it fell off, it fell, the f*ck, off.  [it is from a comedy bit] then after that the a/c went on the fritz which i think was due to bad generator fuel or maybe not.  i would turn on the a/c with the little remote that we have and the fan would slowly turn on, but then after a few seconds when (i think) the compressor would kick in, i could hear the generator start to drag decently (it is just an old diesel engine) and then the a/c would beep and the red light would not be lit.  so i would have to turn it back on again.  after about 28 times of turning it on and it turning itself off then the thing would finally stay on for a bit.  also there was no mosquito net or hangers or shower curtain in the room when i moved in.  now i can understand the mosquito net, maybe that is a ‘personal’ item.  but to take the hangers and the shower curtain?  that’s just dirty.  so for the first night when i moved in i made a mess in the shower area b/c there was hot water coming out of the handle and there was no shower curtain.  eventually that all got under control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/imgp1155_1.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/imgp1155_1.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Imgp1165_1_1][4]][4] then only a matter of days after we got that fixed i wake up to a gigantic pool of water in the bathroom.  i’m telling you, it is a mess.  of course it was a sunday, and no one was working.  so i just mopped it the best i could and then waited it out until monday morning when they could get someone out to fix it.  i couldn’t tell at the time, but it must have been the bidet because when i came home that night there was a huge amount of chaulk around it and there has been no more water.  i haven’t yet used the bidet, b/c i’m american and incompetent.  however a new, little pool is forming around the sink from where the return pipe goes into the wall.  so i think that one is coming. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>[![Imgp1153_1][5]][5] i was also asked what my diet has been like.  i’ve stayed veggie. but it has been really hard. the seafood looks out of this world. usually fruit for breakfast, rice and salad for lunch and then pasta with spinach or beans or something similar. more carbs than i would like, but i’m doing yoga pretty consistently and regulating my portions so i stay a lean mean typing machine. lots of fruit, but very few veggies. salad is hard b/c of the typhoid water, etc. you have to be extraordinarily careful, especially with leafy greens. tomatoes are not too difficult, although we don’t have a very sharp knife in the house, so peeling them can become onerous. drinks? lots of tea and a bit of coffee, and of course beer. the wines are either horrible or wonderful. hit or miss, like much here. there are lots of lebanese around, so when we go out the middle eastern food is generally very tasty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yesterday I wrote about the gaps in the climate change debate.  This document was written in February, 2006 and is the Prosecutor’s response to requests that he look into the Iraq situation.  He lays out his legal authority and his decision space in a very nice, non-lawyer-friendly manner.  And then he says, thank you but no. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, there were no requests that he investigate US actors in Iraq, becuase the US and Iraq are not a state parties to the ICC.  In order for the ICC to prosecute something one of three things has to happen.  (1) The action was perpetrated by a national of one of the state parties. (2) The action was perpetrated on the territory of one of the state parties. (3) Either the territory where the action took place or the nationality of the actor must concede jurisdiction on a case by case basis.  None of those things happened with regards to the US actors in Iraq.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, with regards to the Brits and Aussies who are, actually, world citizens and a part of the ICC, their nationals were subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC.  That means that the prosecutor had the power to investigate their soldiers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now all this is a prelude to my point.  I am intrigued by what he says.  He says that there was a basis for a reasonable belief that crimes were commited, but that the gravity of the crimes was low enough that he was not going to pursue an investigation.  Everyone gets so wrapped around the axel on Iraq, and rightly so, it is a quagmire.  However, it is telling when he says that the number of victims of crimes in Iraq totals in the dozens (less than forty total).  In the three cases where he has actually pursued full investigations (two of which led to indictments and one has a case starting soon) the number of victims totals in the thousands or millions.  This disparity is so huge and is completely missed by the media.  We spend so much of our media attention on Iraq and other things (NaSA love triangles I hear is currently popular for infotainment) and so very little on the real humanity of the situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is about all I have to say about that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I pulled three quotes from the Genocide convention that I think are relevant to the discussion. (1) “Being convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge, international co-operation is required, . . .” Chapeau.  (2)  “The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.” Art. 1.  (3) “Any Contracting Party may call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action under the Charter of the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Art III.” Art. 8.  In my mind, on the face of these three quotes, this means that all states that are party to the convention are under an obligation to prevent it and to punish it, but not to intervene in situations where genocide is occurring.  It seems that that duty rest with the international community.  Perhaps there is a duty to assist the international community in the sense that if the UN asks a state to send peacekeepers to a given country then they should comply with that request as part of their duty to prevent and punish.  I will return to the multilateral approach in a bit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unilateral humanitarian interventionism seems to me a recipe for disaster. In fact, it seems to me that only in a very limited set of circumstances is unilateralism not a recipe for disaster.  In the conflict here in&lt;br>
Sierra Leone&lt;/p>
&lt;p>, there were unilateral interventions and there were multilateral interventions.  Many here felt that ECOMOG, despite the many atrocities that they committed (which were fewer than the RUF/AFRC, but many more than a western or UN force would have committed), was a legitimate intervention force.  Now it is hard to pin down why people thought that.  I am not sure whether they thought it was correct because they thought the AFRC/RUF were worse, or they preferred the “elected” Kabbah government or because they felt that the international community embodied in this West African regional IO was a legitimate force.  Likely it was a mix of all three of those variables.  NATO in Kosovo, despite the objections at the time, may have only survived because it was a multilateral force. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am not sure all my history is correct, but I think that when the Marines went into&lt;br>
Somalia&lt;/p>
&lt;p>at the very beginning we were alone.  Whether that was the initial thrust of an overarching multilateral plan I am not aware.  I do know that we were the first in and the rest of the world, including the UN came later. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The history aside, if legitimacy for humanitarian intervention can only come from a multilateral force does this make sense?  There are definite advantages to a multilateral approach: legitimacy derived from the UN and the SC, a healthy debate on the topic, leverage with other states in the region.  However, there may be advantages to a unilateral approach as well: speed and tempo can be achieved by the unity of command, especially with regards to regional interventions the intervening, foreign troops may be more culturally-sensitive to the “target” country. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a couple of things that trouble me about a unilateral intervention.  The first is fairly realpolitik.  But what are the intervening state’s interests.  It seems to me that if the international community allowed a unilateral intervention to occur then really it would be one step away from allowing an invasion.  Countries in the region would merely incite under the table a genocide, and then intervene to set up a friendly government or continue to occupy “for the protection of the occupied people.”  &lt;em>See Syria/Lebanon&lt;/em>.  The second one is despite the hang-ups that most of my Marine friends have with the UN, a unilateral approach may be less efficient.  Now, I would not argue that it would be inefficient for US Marines to go into&lt;br>
East Timor&lt;/p>
&lt;p>alone and secure that country and keep the peace there for a temporary amount of time before handing over to another body.  I would not argue that it would inefficient for the Brits to do something similar.  But outside a handful of countries that have the capacity to get a fighting force efficiently to other parts of the world, it seems to me that a pooling of resources would be more efficient.  Lastly, genocide is a crime against humanity.  In my mind that means that the world community should be involved.  Even if it was a genocide against an ethnic group in one country and that ethnicity controlled in another country, it is still a crime against the entirety of humanity. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that by taking it out of the hands of individual states the Genocide convention probably does it properly.  I mainly believe, for myself, that the &lt;em>best&lt;/em> reason is the last that I have listed above.  Placing the decisions in the hands of multilateral bodies means that genocide remains a crime against the entirety of humanity.  A state or non-state actor who perpetrates genocide should feel the entirety of the weight of humanity against him or her.  This is likely to be the most efficient deterrence that can be created.  I must caveat my deterrence argument with the thought that the entirety of humanity must be ready to act when genocide occurs, something that heretofore has not happened. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I do not believe that the institutional allocation should shift terribly towards the international, I think that in certain ways the current&lt;br>
US&lt;/p>
&lt;p>isolationist approach is costing us much more than we are gaining out of.  While&lt;br>
Europe&lt;/p>
&lt;p>continues to spend money on social services consistently fostering good will throughout the world and&lt;br>
Asia&lt;/p>
&lt;p>spends money on education and infrastructure building (especially with regards to technical infrastructure) we flounder with a bloated defence budget.  This is a different topic entirely, but the point is that by becoming less isolationalist and more multilateralist we will save money that can go towards social services in our country or another or can go to the people directly in the form of tax relief (depending on one’s political proclivities).  It seems that many think that leadership can only come in the form of doing what you want when you want.  This is a medieval king’s approach to sovereignty.  Leadership can come in the form of example.  I will continue to advocate for engagement and leadership by participation until I am have been disproved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is much more here, but I should work now.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>hello.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this weekend was pretty amazingly long.  in a good way i guess.  except for i had a lot of work that could have been done, but i never got around to it.  it is mitigated by the fact that none of it was actually due this weekend, i just wanted to get started on it.  that can happen later i guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the weekend basically began on wednesday when we hosted our own welcome aboard party and some friends came over for american game night.  we played catchphrase (the bastard child of taboo and hot potato) and beer pong (the bastard child of many college greecians). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![030207_1343][3]][3] thursday we went out to copacabanas (written about earlier).  on friday we heard from a friend that the embassy was having happy hour at atlantic.  atlantic is a large club on right on the beach that is usually the friday night hang out.  we had been there last friday night and it was filled with british military boys (who are here to train the SL military and police and have been for years) and locals.  this night, when we walked in, there were approximately eight people in the entire joint.  all of them were us embassy workers and none of them knew us.  but we saddled up to the table.  after an oddly awkward exchange with some people the ambassador asked my friend and i to sit across the table from him and his wife. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/030207_1343.jpg">http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/030207_1343.jpg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![040207_1430_2][4]][4] so there we were, rapping with the ambassador and his wife.  they were almost iconic in their precision to my vision of an ambassador and his wife in a poor african country.  smart, insightful, bubbly, a vision of all the good things about our country.  they had met here in sierra leone while in the peace corps in the sixties, fell in love and have been globe trotting together ever since.  we ended our experience at atlantic by grabbing a taxi to paddy’s.  paddy’s is a famous place and the place that is the model for the amalgam of the beach bar ‘profiled’ in the film [blood diamond][4].  the owner of paddy’s has been knighted by the queen of england for, essentially, providing hookers and beer to brit expats and military trainers here throughout the war and reconstruction years.   but apparently none of its ‘famous’ patrons were there on friday nights…&lt;em>see&lt;/em> &lt;em>supra.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[![Imgp1174_2][6]][6] saturday.  what happened?  o yeah.  i slept in.  our housemate fired our caretaker at six in the morning over loud arguing whilst we were trying to sleep.  then i went back to sleep.  after i awoke for real we got called that we had a ride to the market.  we had yet to go.  it is an experience.  tight alleyways filled to the brim with kiosks selling everything that i ever donated to goodwill.  there were tons of pirate dvd’s and cd’s bubbling over with african jams that i’ve gotten to know at the above mentioned venues, brilliant fruits, and very few things worth buying.  the first two pictures i posted are from this market.  i was able to come across a french press and a can opener that actually works.  both purchases make me happy.  haggling for them does not.  i am not wired to haggle.  i like the fact that a price is a price.  i don’t make a good car purchaser or any other purchaser.  it feels just off to me, i feel creepy when i do it.  i’m not sure why.  but i made the purchases. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>spent the afternoon rapping with some friends while watching cricket on satelitte tv.  then we had a group that cooked a good italian dinner.  then we went out.  again.  to a party.  again.  afterwards to paddy’s.  again.  the second time tho was fundamentally different.  paddy’s is happening on saturdays.  we arrived home at 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>again there was drama with our housemates and the help first thing in the morning.  again, i didn’t care.  again, i went back to sleep afterwards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![N557965146_57200_4735][7]][7] sunday we went to the beach.  it was the second beach we had gone to.  at this one there was a haven set back from the beach and separated from the beach by a fordable river.  it was shady and delicious.  you can see the patio where we ate.  i had some pasta with a cream sauce and mushrooms, then i had ice cream, then i had coffee.  then i felt like a colonialist. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>i understand what this article is trying to argue, but i don’t agree. this article cites one israeli scientist that published one paper that may or may not have been peer reviewed and claims that there is a scientific debate. in fact what the IPCC found is that there is a greater than 90% chance that climate change is caused by human factors. the FDA uses a figure something on the order of 20 – 30 % chance that there is a link between a drug and side effect or between a food and harmful effect in order to make policy decisions about whether to approve a drug, take it off the shelves or whatnot. the EPA uses an even lower figure as to the chance of a causal actually exists and whether or not to make policy decisions based upon it. in each of these policy realms where science is invoked it will never be precise. there will always be critics. however what policy makers must do is to set limits and do an economic analysis of the cost and benefits in real monetary terms and in (i would argue) human terms. now if the EPA and FDA make decisions in the presence of a 30% (maximum) probability that there is a causal link that will impact, what are we doing absolutely nothing when there is now a high degree of consensus that the probability of the human-climate change link is three times that high. i understand the argument that if some regulation/legislation were passed then it will have more drastic overall economic consequences to the entire economy rather than the relatively isolated sectoral effects that would be felt when the other, but similar, governmental bodies pass science-based policy measures. however when the probability of the causal link is this high, it seems that we have reached the point that something needs to be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>there are various ways that, on its face, this one scientists’ arguments implode on themselves. i will put those aside b/c they are too easy to address.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i agree that there is a gap in the media’s propoganda machine. but gaps are inevitable. they will exist no matter the issue. the only way to fix that from a policy perspective is transparency (something that cam and I are basing much of our ethos on). there has been, to date, a lack of transparency in the government as to why nothing has been done. because of this lack of governmental/political debate we are left to propoganda from whatever side one must swing on. if inaction is the proper action (which i categorically deny that it is correct here, but in other situations inaction may be more efficient/equitable), then the populace needs to be convinced by the government that failed to act as to why they chose inaction. this is the feedback loop that i think only partially exists.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>i feel odd when people ask me to tell them stories, because i don’t have many.  right now my life has been fairly boring.  just work, home, go out (maybe) and repeat. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>we cannot really talk about work, but i can say that it is interesting and intense stuff.  home is boring.  that leaves going out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>last night we went out to a place that went to during our first night here.  it was a nice difference to see how comfortable we have become in two weeks.  people say that freetown is the smallest 1M person city they have ever known.  i’m quickly finding that to be the case.  especially among the expat community.  when i first arrived here i was awed by the number of and symbols of ngo’s &amp;amp; io’s that were plastered onto the old land rovers driving the packed, diesel-fume-filled streets of this tight city.  every0ne that i had ever heard about was here: oxfam, usaid, unicef, british high council, save the children, and the list goes on and on.  it was like my entire folders of web links that have to do with activism, social entrepeneurship, and ID was plastered onto the side of small, inconspicuous, dilapidated signs for my eyes to graze as i drove or walked around this city.  at first it was daunting.  eventually i realized that it is a fairly small community. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there were two things that i always envisioned myself doing.  one was living on vacation.  after two years of ski bumming and river ratting and being unemployed and writing and living a pretty outdoor lifestyle, i think that i can check that block.  the other was spurned by reading too much hemingway during my formative years (whatever the hell those are) and that was to live as an expat.  there is something magically romantic to me when the answers to where are you from come in the form of countries and accents are measured in degrees of separation from britian or paris or berlin or moscow as opposed to whether or not you watch nascar and go to church on sunday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that is it for now.  i have piles on my desk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is the view from my private balcony along one axis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[![Image003][3]][3]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And from another axis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This city so far has been exactly what I had expected. It is fulfilling the picture I had in created over the six months or so of anticipation. People who have been here longer than I tend to ask the obvious question to fill the small talk obligation. “So how do you like Freetown.” “I like it fine, it is pretty close to what I had expected.” And so the conversations tend to begin. The amount of latent physical beauty that surrounds this place is stunning. And yet it is hard to make the claim that this city, at least, is idyllic because of the human tragedy and suffering that currently exists. You look one way you see one thing. You look another way you see something different. And often these two are as disparately disconnected as these two pictures are from one another. And yet this had been expected. What hadn’t been expected is the low amount of harassment by beggars for money. I was prepared for it to be constant considering that the last time I was in Jamaica it was some of the worst amount of begging I’ve ever experiences and considering that much of the original population of Sierra Leone were freed Jamaican slaves. They have had extremely divergent experiences, but at least they come from the same blood lines. But I must be careful b/c that is a completely different tangent which I do not want to progress in this short introductory note. Instead of not being able to walk anywhere for wading through crowds of outstretched hands, instead of that we are barely noticed as my housemate and I make our daily walks to the Lebanese supermarket. I must write in a future post about the Lebanese mafia in this town. They fascinate and frighten me. But they have good pita breads, and bobaghanous in a can and hummus in a can and olives, and chocolates, and nice teas and nice coffees and a few other niceties. There is no produce in the supermarket. For a while I was confused by this, until I realized that I have to talk to the lady out in the parking lot who had her wares assembled for my viewing and smelling pleasures. It is tropical here, so the citrus is great, the mangoes are to die for, the bananas are odd but tasty the guavas and cucumbers and star fruit etc are all delightful. There aren’t many tomatoes, but you can find them if you know where to look. Luckily I’ve found someone on my walk who sells nice tomatoes, even if they are a bit underripe. I like them that way, ripened to my precise specifications. We walk home up the hill loaded down with that evening’s groceries and a few bottles of water. Camels plodding up to the trough. It is usually dark by then, but it is strangely nice to be walking in the heat, loaded with groceries. You feel a part of it all. Although we do not carry our stuff on our heads. It is cliché I realize to associate that with Africa in general, but it is a way of life here. Kids will carry dining tables on their heads, men will carry two cement bags on their heads, women will carry bundles of 12 foot long poles on their heads. It is amazing. But we don’t carry them on our heads. We do, however, sweat. We are always sweaty heaps when we knock on our gate and the guards let us in our compound. Without fail we will bring the two on duty a soda. We feel that it is just a good way of living our lives. Maybe they would prefer a little extra cash, but Cokes taste pretty good on a hot evening. Not to me though, as I’m still soda free. More disconnection coming in the future. I just wanted to give you a small sampling. ~ # ~&lt;/p>

I finished the paper yesterday and the project just now, so I feel very refreshed. Now I can focus fully on the work here and then having fun. The beaches are delightful, apparently, and I’m excited to visit them soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Freetown is an amazing place and I am incredibly happy to be here. The people in the office are passionate and smart and caring. The people in town are warm and friendly, despite my whiteness. There is a bunch of pickpocketing, but other than that places are safe to go. We’re just being smart and being safe and all is good. Wait until I can break out the camera (maybe this weekend) and send you some pictures from here. It is so surreal to be in a place where people are walking around with bundles on their head, where creole is spoken everywhere, where the only water many have access to is runoff, where the colors of the buildings blow your mind, where the dust gets blown down from the sahara and mixes with the ocean breezes to create a thick haze that makes it difficult to see the ocean.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Off to watch the film Blood Diamond in Freetown with the people that have been prosecuting and defending and adjudicating and living it for years.  Talk about surreal!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>i love you. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>being without you has caused me to do crazy things.  i bought an ipod a day before i leave for africa becuase my last one, with you all up in it, decided to blow the fuck up.  it was a bastard anyway and i was getting jealous of your involvement with it.  it was good to have you back.  i looked at you on my computer, felt you when i packed and listened to you via a long series of cords and conundrums on my latest trip becuase the last ipod….well we won’t talk about that. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i remember our first encounter at the turtles music store in chattanooga the christmas when i got my first cd player.  i was armed with a gift certificate from UD and i wanted to get the first pearl jam album.  the sheep on it made my mom squirmed so i settled on the eric clapton unplugged album.  there were tapes before, but that music was fleeting.  it was my first foray and you cannot fall in love when you are merely experimenting.  but that cd was real.  i still have it in hard and soft form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the transition was difficult for both of us, i know.  when we moved over from cd’s to 0′s and 1′s we both took it hard.  i missed flipping through your plastic, rigged cases.  i think you missed me too.  it was so much easier to travel with you, but harder to communicate with you.  sometimes the screens were impersonal and sometimes it was difficult to find what i really wanted to listen to from your bloated ranks.  in the old days i would have to pull cd’s and put them in my caselogics.  this forced me to choose a smaller subset and would let me focus on making good choices in my life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we’ve seen the world together.  and you always are there to remind me of my past, and keep me on the path towards the future whereever that will lead us.  whenever i think of home, parents, family, close friends, ex-girlfriends, places and events there is somewhere in your depths a song that will make your memory more poignant.  i will always remember having to pull off the side of the road because i was crying too hard after mamo died while listening to a dead can dance song.  i will always remember the hope of a new relationship that came while listening to 66 by afghan’s.  i will always remember my marines singing at the top of their lungs california, no doubt about it when we were returning from okinawa on a jet plane.  i will always remember my dad when i play billie joel and my mother when i play norah jones.  there are too many other permanent, cognitive overlaps to list.  suffice it to say you allow me to remember better than i can by myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>you make me a better person.  by reminding me of my past and what value system i have chosen you keep me grounded.  whenever i think that something will be too difficult i put on some bob seger.  whenever i am confused about the present and how it relates to the future i put on the sunscreen song.  whenever i become frustrated with the lack of like-minded individuals around me i put on taylor mali.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>you are beautiful, serene, and transformative.  won’t you join me in africa?  thanks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the conversation was good for a number of reasons.  mainly it was good to now have a picture of what his voice sounds like.  that is an odd thing to start with, i guess, but fuck you.  he mostly confirmed a bunch of my suspicions about things. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>he wants me to come to DC in january, which is a positive sign.  he also mentioned that it is not unknown for people to go in straight from law school, another very positive sign.  there were two things that were extremely heartening and one that was in the proximity of disheartening, if slightly oblique to it.  that is why i’m giving it mixed reviews. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the first thing that was really heartening is that this firm really, truly is looking for good people for a career.  scott told me of one of his underlings who has recently left for a different job for a limited time with everyone (meaning the firm and her) knowing full well that she is merely getting some required predicates elsewhere and will return when she has paid some dues.  this evinced what i’ve suspected from a web site troll.  they really want to develop and keep people for a career.  this is appealing to me.  consulting seems to be the only area where i feel that i’ll be able to reconcile my nesting and adventure halves.  if it was good enough for bilbo, why not for me?  so even though there are so many areas of my life where i’m no where near ready to settle down it would be nice to have a center to let the centripetal and centrifugal forces of my inherrently swirling life spin me around.  having that base will also give me a grounded purpose and lend resolve and significance to the decisions that i’ve made.  it seems that so many of decisions have led me to temporary situations.  that is well and good, but there is a growing portion of me that is getting over temporary.  i feel that all i’ve done in my life is figure things out, get used to them, and leave.  it would be nice to know that i have a base, something familiar for a significant period of time.  this firm has a large number of people who have been there for a significant amount of time.  it would be pleasing to be of that number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the second significantly heartening aspect of the interview is that he is truly excited about mentoring me.  i could hear it in his voice and i could hear it in the things that he was telling me.  he told me a few things that &amp;ldquo;pour[ed] cold water on your thinking&amp;rdquo; and he was truly sorry to have to do it and didn’t do it to dishearten me but to give me the realities of the marketplace b/c he told me that he knew i was ignorant on a lot of the realities.  and he was right.  i am.  he also told me that he is going to set me up with two other consulting firms when i come to dc and not in an effort to push me out from his firm, but do give me more of a perspective as to what is out there.  he also said in numerous occasions throughout our twenty minute conversation how excited he was about having good, young people excited about development and decried the general lack of them. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the slightly disheartening thing is that to do many of the projects that USAID gives to this firm that are in the foreign judicial reform area i will need 3-5 years of legal experience.  that has to be at a firm or in government or elsewhere, but it has to be legal experience and i cannot get it along the way while at the development consulting firm.  they are block bureuacratic requirements and there isn’t any getting around them.  so he told me that to really dig deeply into what he does it would be most advantageous for me to go work elsewhere in the government or whatnot for a few years and then come work at his firm.  it did pour some cold water on me–at first.  upon further reflection, though, i realized that it wouldn’t be a bad thing in a couple of ways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>when i told my mentor here about it, he said well get off your ass and get in an application for a presidential management intern.  apparently PMI’s hang the moon when they are done with their tenures.  and i could work in USAID or state as one.  they are essentially a mobile, deployable, rapid reaction force for the executive in cases where he needs work done that has to do with one’s subject matter expertise.  this would be appealing.  my mentor is pretty pragmatic and wouldn’t encourage me if he didn’t think that i had a shot at getting the job.  so maybe that is something i should think about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the other reason that i’m not terribly disheartened is the fact that i would only need to get that check in the block to become a legal reform subject matter expert (which would allow the firm to bill USAID in a higher bracket for my services, and thus i would come in at a higher position and get paid more, blah blah).  when i really think about it, i am ignorant.  i know that i want to be in the democracy/governance/conflict management/rule of law arena.  but within that arena i’m not positive that foreign judicial reform is my targetted niche.  so i think that there would be nothing wrong with going in as more of a generalist and getting in on projects.  i would be lower in the rankings with the plebians who only have their MPP’s and i would get paid less, but neither of those scare me.  plus there is nothing that would keep me from cross-decking were i to hit a glass ceiling and really wanted to do something that would require 3-5 years of true legal experience.  So i am thinking that there would be nothing wrong with trying to go to the firm for a few years and get my feet in the door and figuring it out exactly what is intellectually stimulating.  cause it be an area where a simple masters will suffice.  and it may not. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>nevertheless, i’m going to give it much more thought and i’m going to go into the callback with an open mind and ask a lot of questions and then take it from there.  one step at a time.  despite my daydreams.  like i keep telling myself:  &lt;em>nothing is fucked here dude&lt;/em>. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>i look around the studio from time to time and i wonder why everyone else is there.  i think at my studio here in nashville most people are doing the hot yoga becuase it is, like, so relaxing.  that and it is close to their little sorority houses.  these are the girls in short tight black shorts, blue sports bras and t-shirts with party titles over them.  they bring their cell phones into class; they bring their mouths into class; they bring their figetting into class; they’ve got it all as i’m sure they are happy to proclaim.  that isn’t why i do yoga.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i think that many other people do it to lose weight.  this seems a much more laudable goal than the passive workout goal that the slut-ority girls take.  these people are very passive as well, but in a different way.  they are their with their loose shorts, their blank t-shirts and a look of determination, pain and hope in their eyes.  that isn’t why i do yoga.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then there are the workout junkies.  these are the women that i see a couple of times a week and the other guy who i see a bunch.  they are in yoga clothes, they have carriers for their yoga mats.  they bring cockiness, energy, flexibility and happiness into the room.  they are the ones that laugh when the teacher claims that we’re going to be in the pose for only seven more minutes, becuase they are in shape enough to be relaxed enough to laugh.  that isn’t why i do yoga.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>at times during my journey through yoga i have been in each of these three categories.  passive workout, weight loss determined, junkie performance focussed.  i’m not sure how i would categorize myself now, though.  when i first started i was in colorado and was in great shape, running five times a week and attending yoga once.  i just wanted something different.  i was starting down the holistic road that i currently am further along and i had read so many times what good it was for your balance (which i sought for skiing, climbing and kayaking) as well as your strength and focus (which i sought for….life). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>at first i was baffled.  it was a constant mental endeavour that i didn’t really enjoy but took enjoyment at a remove from the masichistic happenings.  i liked that i wasn’t comfortable.  i liked that i wasn’t sane.  i liked that i wasn’t god. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>then after i moved to nashville and started to settle in here i started to go about twice a week and was running about three or so times a week.  at this point i had been running for about 12 years, averaging something like 20 or 25 miles a week on my legs.  that is a lot of miles: do the math.  i was really tight and i was starting to show in the yoga studio.  my hips, my gluts, my quads were all no where near as flexible as they should be for someone who was actually in shape.  i overcompensated for this by forcing my way into poses.  i pulled muscles constantly.  i had no balance, but i had focus and i muscled through poses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>during winter break last year my knees started to give me fits while running and i made a pact with myself to take a year off of running and to just do yoga.  i had been steadily creschendoing my attendence to yoga all along the way and i knew that it could sufice to keep me in shape and slender enough to not kill myself plus it wouldn’t bang my legs as much.  so i started going about four times a week.  that was enough.  i started to get really used to things.  i got used to the sequence.  i got used to my heartrate and when it increased and decreased.  i thought i was figuring it all out.  i wasn’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>lately i’ve been steadily instituting half-ass yoga sessions where i force myself to not muscle anything, but to just take a step off of every pose.  go into them 3/4 of what i would normally do.  i started to learn some things.  i started to learn how to relax.  i went much deeper objectively when i relaxed.  it was antithetical to the modern western view of how to work out.  if you want to get bigger you put more weight on the bar.  if you want to get more flexible you relax.  this is becuase muscles have little springs that keep the muscle from ripping away from the bone.  these springs clamp down with you force something, but if you can get them to relax the muscles can generally get looser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but this is a story, not a reason.  i go to yoga b/c it is my rock.  it is the only steadiness in my constantly swirling world.  don’t get me wrong i’m not complaining about my swirls.  i create them, i encourage them, i like them.  but there is a side of me that likes sameness.  it is that side that i passify when i walk into the yoga studio.  it is why i do bikram yoga.  he is known as mcYoga and i know that i can walk into one of his studios in boulder, austin, NYC, key west or nashville and it will be the same series.  it is my sameness that i like. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i think that the woman who owns the studio here discounts that.  her view is that yoga should be like life, constantly flowing and constantly changing, and humans should learn to relax and go with the flow.  i understand that view.  especially from her perspective where the studio is her life.  the studio is not my life, it is my harbor from my life.  i get annoyed when she changes things unilaterally without even telling us so that we can chose differently.  my favorite teacher there is the metronome woman.  she keeps us in poses for the same amount of time each time, ,she starts on time, she finishes on time, she doesn’t do different poses &amp;ldquo;just for fun.&amp;rdquo;  i love her.  she inherently understands why I come to yoga.  this philosophical alignment makes for a better class.  when i can relax my mind i can relax my body.  if you make me think then i cannot relax my body as much. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i have three rules and after i do a few warm-up stretches i say a little mantra to myself while i lay down with my eyes closed and the little japanese music playing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>rule number 1: feed, don’t fight.  it is imperative to not fight the energy in the room, don’t fight the teacher, even if you don’t like what she is doing, don’t fight the people in the room.  feed off of their insecurities, off their figetting, off their yogic energy, feed off the energy in the room.  feed, don’t fight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>rule number 2: you are an amateur.  yoga is a process, it is not a destination.  don’t think that you are going to get there today.  it is ok to not go all out.  it is ok that you don’t go as far as she does.  it is ok that you don’t go as far as you did yesterday.  yoga is a practice, it is immeasurable.  release yourself and enjoy it.  you are an amateur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>rule number 3: go deep.  go deep into your mind.  enjoy what is inside.  don’t worry about what is around you.  don’t worry what is being said.  don’t worry what others are doing.  go deep into your body.  feel your way into poses.  feel your way inside poses.  feel your way out of poses.  don’t look, feel.  go deep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i say that mantra every single time.  almost word for word, to myself as i lay there. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>THAT is why i go to yoga….that, and i’m a dirty fucking hippie.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wow, Dave, Three posts from me in one day….aren’t you happy?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>——&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cases we were assigned raise an interesting question of&lt;br>
institutional allocation. The case&lt;br>
addresses unilateral trade sanctions by one of the WTO member States. That said, there is nothing stopping the WTO&lt;br>
from expanding that ruling to include multilateral trade sanctions that could&lt;br>
be imposed by a COP to an environmental treaty. If that expansion were to happen then would all subsequent and earlier&lt;br>
environmental treaties be subject to the provisions of the WTO if it wanted to&lt;br>
adopt a trade sanction as an enforcement mechanism? Could existing environmental treaties that&lt;br>
include other enforcement mechanisms (carbon caps and trading for example) be&lt;br>
construed as dampening effects upon trade and market development and&lt;br>
correlatively must they then pass a WTO test? &lt;/p>
&lt;p> If the answers to these questions were always yes that would&lt;br>
turn the WTO into the defacto authorization body for all&lt;br>
environmental/labor/human rights etc. treaties. That cannot be the case. The&lt;br>
authorizing bodies for all treaties are states that negotiate and ratify and&lt;br>
enforce the treaties. Thus we must ask&lt;br>
how to allocate the power as between institutions. For the purposes of this presentation we will&lt;br>
be examining the WTO as one institution and the COP of an environmental treaty&lt;br>
(such as an RFMO) as the competing institution. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> There are two questions that must be asked when looking to&lt;br>
how to allocate power as between international institutions. (1) What is the power of the States party to&lt;br>
the institution as well as the institution itself to prescribe rules and standards&lt;br>
governing the subject matter of the treaty? This is known in the State context&lt;br>
as &lt;em>prescriptive jurisdiction&lt;/em>. (2) What is the power of the States party to the institution as well as the&lt;br>
institution itself to adjudicate interpretive or substantive disputes that&lt;br>
arise in the course of implementation and execution of the treaty? This is known as &lt;em>adjudicatory jurisdiction&lt;/em>. When you look at competing institutions you are basically asking: how do&lt;br>
we allocate the prescriptive and adjudicatory jurisdiction as between them? &lt;/p>
&lt;p> The institutional allocation issue is not unique to int’l&lt;br>
law.  However the int’l law application&lt;br>
of the issue raises unique questions. Questions&lt;br>
of institutional allocation are familiar to American lawyers in the contexts of&lt;br>
administrative law (how much should Congress legislate and how much should it&lt;br>
leave to the administrative agencies) as well as federalism. Int’l law brings unique questions to the&lt;br>
issue. The two main questions come from:&lt;br>
complete, uniform and absolute sovereignty as well as from the equal footing of&lt;br>
treaties. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> All treaties may not be created equal, but there is no&lt;br>
hierarchy of treaties. The UN Charter&lt;br>
may be the granddaddy of treaties, but outside that there is very little hierarchical&lt;br>
rules. Certainly there is no standard&lt;br>
regime for distributing between treaties. There are three applicable rules of construction from the Vienna&lt;br>
Convention on the Laws of treaties that are applicable. They are all found in Article 30. (1) Lex Specialis could trump lex generalis&lt;br>
if the later treaty contains greater detail and if it regulates the same&lt;br>
subject matter as an earlier treaty. This is only applicable if all relevant States are parties to both treaties. (2) When all applicable States are parties to&lt;br>
the subsequent treaty the later in time rule usually applies. (3) When all applicable States are parties to&lt;br>
only one treaty, that treaty trumps treaties that not all applicable States are&lt;br>
parties to. These rules may cut against&lt;br>
each other in various contexts, but outside of these general rules there are no&lt;br>
specific rules for conflict of laws and conflict of forum scenarios that arise&lt;br>
as between int’l treaties.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> Second, states retain the power. It is only in ceding power to an IO that that&lt;br>
IO gains any power. But all power is&lt;br>
vested in the individual states. This is&lt;br>
extremely familiar to American lawyers as a federalism concern. However, it is different in the int’l context&lt;br>
because there is no absolute inclusion like there is in the
US&lt;/p>
&lt;p>context. This lack of absolute inclusion, or what&lt;br>
could be termed top-down compulsion, adds a level of complexity to the debate&lt;br>
when it turns to rights of dissenters as well as the prescriptive jurisdiction. Just because a state may cede some&lt;br>
prescriptive power to the WTO to set various schedules and rates, that does not&lt;br>
mean that the state necessarily cedes prescriptive power to that body to&lt;br>
regulate domestic environmental policy. When&lt;br>
a State does not like or agree with an action taken by IO, the latter body has&lt;br>
very little power to force its will on the State. If the State finds it more efficient or less&lt;br>
costly it can leave the IO or snub its nose at the IO. B/c the ultimate power is vested in the State&lt;br>
and there is no ability of the IO to force compulsion a State will only comply&lt;br>
with the will of an IO if it is less costly to do so. These costs come in reputational and&lt;br>
political as well as in economic forms. The same cannot be true in the
US&lt;/p>
&lt;p>federal system. If GA doesn’t like a decision or a statute of&lt;br>
the federal government it cannot snub its nose at the federal government and it&lt;br>
cannot pack its bags. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> Now that we have identified a few of the unique questions&lt;br>
that arise when asking institutional allocation questions in the international&lt;br>
context, let’s apply those to our question. First off, when we ask questions of the allocation of prescriptive&lt;br>
jurisdiction as between IO’s that will necessarily alter the jurisdiction as&lt;br>
between states. Some states will have&lt;br>
much more involvement in one treaty than they will in another. States that have more invested in a given&lt;br>
treaty will obviously want that treaty body (or IO) to have more prescriptive&lt;br>
jurisdiction. There are also the questions&lt;br>
of influence over the subject matter, involvement in the “legislative” process,&lt;br>
and expertise over the subject matter.  &lt;/p>
&lt;p> This horizontal allocation of jurisdictional power as&lt;br>
between states becomes especially salient when you look across subject matter&lt;br>
boundaries. Some societies will&lt;br>
obviously value a given subject matter more than they may value other subject&lt;br>
matter (turtles may be more important than money to some). The difference in values placed by each State&lt;br>
on a given subject matter creates a tension as between different IO’s. Some small coastal states, or states with&lt;br>
large fishing fleets will have a lot of social investment, as well as capital&lt;br>
investment, in a RFMO and due to that investment they may wield more influence&lt;br>
in that IO. They will necessarily want&lt;br>
to optimize the jurisdictional power of their IO, often at a cost to IO’s that&lt;br>
regulate a different subject matter where their investments would have paid&lt;br>
smaller dividends.  Since each State&lt;br>
retains its sovereignty, it may be able to minimize the costs associated with&lt;br>
the transference of jurisdictional power as between IO’s by withdrawing from&lt;br>
the IO where power was drawn from or threatening to withdraw or by taking other&lt;br>
political tacks. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> As one commentator has written “the market for transactions&lt;br>
in prescriptive jurisdiction is not yet very liquid.” This creates a problem if states do not&lt;br>
efficiently allocate from the start.  Since int’l law is an iterative process that&lt;br>
allocation can arguably never be efficient from the start, b/c there is no&lt;br>
start. What is time zero for one IO&lt;br>
cannot be time zero for another. Even if&lt;br>
they were to enter force on the same day, the provisions of each treaty are to&lt;br>
be interpreted in light of the context of the treaty. That context is a fluid thing that includes&lt;br>
all the events that gave rise to the negotiation of the treaty as well as the&lt;br>
way the negotiations were handled. Even&lt;br>
if there was a start point getting the initial allocation of prescriptive&lt;br>
jurisdiction efficiently allocated may involve a transaction with costs that&lt;br>
outweigh the benefits in every occasion. The transaction costs are likely to include: negotiating costs,&lt;br>
differing values and preferences and interests, binding, depth, holdouts,&lt;br>
reputational costs and political costs. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> If there is no start point and if there is a very limited&lt;br>
possibility that states are going to efficiently optimize jurisdictional power,&lt;br>
then states must allocate jurisdictional power as between IO’s as efficiently&lt;br>
as possible along the way. This dynamic&lt;br>
component of the int’l law system can be easily analogized to a market system. But what is the market in prescriptive&lt;br>
jurisdiction? It is the int’l community&lt;br>
with a revolving door of relevant actors who have a revolving door of interests&lt;br>
motivating their actions. Or maybe&lt;br>
states could cede all powers in a repository that can allocate prescriptive&lt;br>
jurisdiction as between subject matter or regional IO’s. This centralized authority could bring&lt;br>
certainty to a system as well as stemming externalities in races to the bottom&lt;br>
by allocating prescriptive jurisdiction to the IO most likely to have the power&lt;br>
or influence or wedge that would stem a state’s momentum. This flexibility may be something we&lt;br>
want. If the int’l community wants a&lt;br>
State to live up to a certain norm then a central repository could allocate&lt;br>
prescriptive jurisdiction to an IO where that State has a larger stake than&lt;br>
influence. The targeted State would then&lt;br>
find itself in a position where the costs of non-compliance outweigh the&lt;br>
benefits. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> Next I want to turn to the adjudicatory jurisdictional&lt;br>
issues. The world of treaties may look&lt;br>
to be discreet circles, but basically it represents a web of ven diagrams. This reality necessitates that there are&lt;br>
going to be many instances where there are competing norms and competing&lt;br>
interpretations and competing regulatory/policy responses. But there are two distinct questions&lt;br>
here: choice of law and choice of&lt;br>
forum. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> In Art. 20 of the GATT the WTO said that other int’l&lt;br>
agreements that were entered into as necessary to protect human, animal or&lt;br>
plant life or heath are exempted from the provisions of the GATT. But that exemption has not been adopted. Indeed as the cases here illustrate, the WTO&lt;br>
has  put its fingers in many pots. So which norms should trump which? Which treaty should trump which? Which law should trump which? There is clearly no normative reason why the&lt;br>
provisions of the WTO should trump those of an int’l treaty. Now this is not what the WTO ruled,&lt;br>
ostensibly, even in its formalistic, far-reaching holding in Shrimp/Turtle&lt;br>
I. But if the regulations on trade and&lt;br>
on capture that were adopted by the
US&lt;/p>
&lt;p>had been adopted by a RFMO how&lt;br>
could the WTO rule that its norms trump those of the RFMO’s? How do we choose when faced with such a&lt;br>
conflict of law question? Which treaty&lt;br>
would trump? That treaty which has&lt;br>
primary coverage over the subject matter? That treaty which recognizes the norms of another treaty? That treaty with the most members&lt;br>
trumps? That treaty that has the&lt;br>
strongest enforcement trumps? How we&lt;br>
integrate an allocate these differing bodies of law is becoming an increasingly&lt;br>
important subject for int’l lawyers. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> Lastly, how do we choose the decision maker? Much of the criticism of the WTO in the&lt;br>
aftermath of these cases comes from their perceived or real bias. Should they be dabbling in environmental&lt;br>
protection? More importantly if there&lt;br>
was a buttress, a WEO how would they distribute the decision making as between&lt;br>
them in hard cases. Would they simply&lt;br>
negotiate between them? Would it be&lt;br>
plaintiff’s choice? Would we have to&lt;br>
codify specific choice of forum rules into all future treaties? Would we establish my customary int’l law&lt;br>
certain standards of comity between different forums? What would the comity multifactor test look&lt;br>
like? &lt;/p>
&lt;p> A solution to all this would be to expand the jurisdiction&lt;br>
of the ICJ and the ICC or the WTO, etc. to include all international law. This one-stop shopping for litigants could&lt;br>
prove easy, but is it what the world needs. The difficulties in instituting the ICC are illustrative here. In that instance the ICC was established to&lt;br>
have subject matter jurisdiction over jus cogens norms — norms that are&lt;br>
universally condemned. But yet that&lt;br>
process was long, politically charged and costly on all sides. Its implementation has been far from&lt;br>
perfect. What happens if the int’l&lt;br>
community tries to expand a universal forum to adjudicate norms that are not&lt;br>
nearly as universally condemned. That&lt;br>
lack of moral impetus will probably be the divisive factor. That and the fact that states retain all of&lt;br>
their sovereignty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The following is an excerpt from an email that I sent to classmates of mine who are working on the Kosovo constitution.  It is a general statement of how I currently look at development problems and contains a few hints as to my political and philosophical disposition when I am actually offered the chance to solve some of these problems.  Specifically this is addressing a post-conflict rebuilding, but there are analogies to many aspects of ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>POST-CONFLICT rebuilding and conflict mitigation is what I want to do for a living. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>To that end, I wanted to expound a bit on my philosophies that may give&lt;br>
you&lt;br>
guys a few ideas at a remove.  I am vastly ignorant on many topics,&lt;br>
especially the complex recent history of the region and cultural&lt;br>
dispositions&lt;br>
of each ethnicity in it.  That aside, I’m never afraid to share my&lt;br>
views.  If you don’t want them (this email is fairly lengthy) then just&lt;br>
delete the email and tell me to shut it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>FIRSTLY, BOTTOM-UP solutions are best in the long run, in my opinion.&lt;br>
The&lt;br>
reason that&lt;/p>
&lt;p>America&lt;/p>
&lt;p>is so&lt;br>
stable is not just that we’re a market-based democracy —&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Palestine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>is&lt;br>
too.  It is what we have&lt;br>
done with our market-based democracy. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have enabled and encourage small-business entrepreneurship.  This&lt;br>
entrepreneurship&lt;br>
led to ownership interests which led to entrenchment which led to a&lt;br>
political&lt;br>
impetus to protect the entrenchment of those with money.  Now whether&lt;br>
you&lt;br>
think that this is a good thing (depending on your particular political&lt;br>
tilt)&lt;br>
is aside from the fact that it has created a massive stability.  One&lt;br>
may&lt;br>
look at&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finland&lt;/p>
&lt;p>as a very stable country to emulate, but it would be a very different&lt;br>
country&lt;br>
without Nokia’s money. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have engaged in a bottom-up approach to politics.  This is&lt;br>
structural&lt;br>
as well as cultural.  It is structural in the sense that we allow a&lt;br>
strong&lt;br>
local government (local meaning state in the&lt;/p>
&lt;p>US&lt;/p>
&lt;p>context) with deference given in&lt;br>
each branch of the federal government when appropriate.  It is also&lt;br>
cultural in that it isn’t often that you see someone getting elected to&lt;br>
President or even federal Congress who hasn’t worked his or her way up&lt;br>
through&lt;br>
the system, at least in some limited sense.  This means that you must&lt;br>
often participate in a lower level of sovereign government in order&lt;br>
participate&lt;br>
in the higher level.  This may seem banal, but may countries do not&lt;br>
have&lt;br>
such a cultural &amp;ldquo;bias&amp;rdquo; and will elect people who have worked their&lt;br>
way up through the bureaucratic rungs on one level of government.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have codified our openness.  Ian Bremmer wrote a book that strongly&lt;br>
links a country’s openness to its stability.  Those that are the most&lt;br>
open&lt;br>
are the most stable, those that are the least open are also relatively&lt;br>
stable.  There is a dip in the curve close to the least open side,&lt;br>
where a&lt;br>
country falls into deep instability and if it emerges &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; then it&lt;br>
is on its way to a western style democracy.  Bremmer looks at openness&lt;br>
in&lt;br>
the communicative sense.  He asks what is a people’s ability to&lt;br>
communicate with the outside world, as well as what are the lines of&lt;br>
communication&lt;br>
inside the country.  This isn’t a techno-centric thing, despite the&lt;br>
inevitable connotations.  It is cultural and structural as well,&lt;br>
involving&lt;br>
the political regime established, the embracing of fundamental human&lt;br>
rights&lt;br>
(free expression, free assembly, etc.), education and the like.  This&lt;br>
is&lt;br>
obviously a very European idea and your codification of systems that&lt;br>
retain a&lt;br>
country’s openness are likely to sate many of the EU’s concerns. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>THE SECOND THEME is that although bottom-up solutions may be best in&lt;br>
the long&lt;br>
term, they may not work in many instances.  Many of the people who&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; development seem, to me, eternal optimists and people who really&lt;br>
rely on the power of humanity.  This is all well and good, but problems&lt;br>
arise when you give a people more power than they are able or willing&lt;br>
to&lt;br>
have.  It is the redneck winning the lottery syndrome, before you know&lt;br>
it&lt;br>
you have a culture of corruption with cadillacs sitting on monster&lt;br>
truck wheels&lt;br>
driving the politicians around (or, think post Soviet Russia with six&lt;br>
men&lt;br>
controlling the entire economy).  So in certain places, at certain&lt;br>
times&lt;br>
top down solutions may have to be imposed. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I include in these top-down solutions establishment of patronage&lt;br>
networks from&lt;br>
the government to the people (which are ripe for corruption),&lt;br>
establishment of&lt;br>
semi-autonomous regions (which are ripe for future nationalistic&lt;br>
worries –&lt;br>
when many Shiites flood into Kurdish Iraq because Shiite Iraq is&lt;br>
embroiled in&lt;br>
civil war, why would the Kurds want to remain Iraqi?), establishment of&lt;br>
some&lt;br>
form of affirmative action (contract allocation, governmental seat&lt;br>
allocation,&lt;br>
etc.). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The appeal of top-down solutions is that the ones who can govern do&lt;br>
govern.  This centralizes the decisions and implementations in the&lt;br>
hands&lt;br>
of those that have the knowledge, experience and capacity to actually&lt;br>
govern.  Much of the problem in the developing world is the lack of&lt;br>
people&lt;br>
who are trained to govern.  It isn’t a lack of ability nor is it a lack&lt;br>
of&lt;br>
capacity (often post-conflict rulers will have massive political&lt;br>
capital and&lt;br>
significant economic capital from a world community anxious to &amp;ldquo;solve&lt;br>
the&lt;br>
problem&amp;rdquo;), it is simply an education problem — at least in my mind.&lt;br>
Incompetence will only frustrate the situation.  South Africa has&lt;br>
worked&lt;br>
not only because Mandela had massive political capital, but also&lt;br>
because his&lt;br>
monetary policies were spot-on what was required and generally he had&lt;br>
figured&lt;br>
out how to govern that country; alas the same things cannot be said for&lt;br>
much of&lt;br>
the rest of the continent where incompetent and self-serving rulers&lt;br>
have&lt;br>
created a movable feast of governance. Top-down solutions are also&lt;br>
easier to&lt;br>
impose, easier to regulate, have more accountability (the world bank&lt;br>
will be&lt;br>
happier to give money if it knows exactly what the money is going for),&lt;br>
appeal&lt;br>
to our intellectual notions of symmetry (80% of south africans are&lt;br>
black and&lt;br>
therefore blacks should have 80% of the parliamentary seats), and they&lt;br>
have&lt;br>
worked in many situations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problems with top-down solutions are easy to see when you look at&lt;br>
the&lt;br>
post-colonial world.  The problems that linger in latin america and&lt;/p>
&lt;p>africa&lt;/p>
&lt;p>particularly are endless, many of them&lt;br>
attributable to top-down solutions imposed by governments from afar&lt;br>
without a&lt;br>
careful consideration of why and how they were being adopted and&lt;br>
implemented.  A curious situation arises with these things because&lt;br>
there&lt;br>
is not a historical precedent of not working, it is the exact&lt;br>
opposite.&lt;br>
Many people have seen them work as stop-gap solutions and then be&lt;br>
exploited or&lt;br>
create long-term problems.  Think how long colonialism worked and the&lt;br>
long-term cultural and structural problems that its hangover has&lt;br>
caused.&lt;br>
One of the major problems with&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yugoslavia&lt;/p>
&lt;p>from the start, as I’ve read, was that the Kosovars had semi-autonomy&lt;br>
which&lt;br>
threatened the Serbians.  So if that was a problem in the&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yugoslavia&lt;/p>
&lt;p>situation, creating resentment by the Serbs that fueled Slobadon’s&lt;br>
fire, maybe&lt;br>
doing the same thing to the Serbs in Kosovo is not a good idea.  That&lt;br>
is&lt;br>
very simplistic, and maybe wrong, but it illustrates the point that in&lt;br>
the long-view&lt;br>
it may not be a very good idea. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>SO HOW TO BALANCE top-down short-term stability with bottom-up&lt;br>
long-term&lt;br>
stability?  This is the whole thing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Developers would love to see a&lt;br>
stable-western-style-market-based-democracy.  Institutions (UN, IMF,&lt;br>
WB,&lt;br>
EU) would love to see top-down solutions that have strong&lt;br>
accountability.&lt;br>
Balancing them takes time, education to develop the cultural&lt;br>
dispositions that&lt;br>
allow for the give and take a society needs to grow.  Balancing also&lt;br>
requires a certain amount of structural flexibility.  So whatever the&lt;br>
solution is, it has to take into account the culture and history of the&lt;br>
region,&lt;br>
the country and the specific minorities or problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Generally I’ve seen two paradigms: (1) step-approach, phase-out&lt;br>
approach.&lt;br>
This is where institutions start out very centralized and then they&lt;br>
slowly let&lt;br>
the sand fall through the fingers.  An apt example is&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turkey&lt;/p>
&lt;p>, Ataturk had strong centralized&lt;br>
control&lt;br>
but never &amp;ldquo;wanted&amp;rdquo; that and eventually, after he passed and&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turkey&lt;/p>
&lt;p>could&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;handle it,&amp;rdquo; the centralized control was distributed.  (2)&lt;br>
structural-flexibility from the start approach.  This is the&lt;/p>
&lt;p>US&lt;/p>
&lt;p>founding&lt;br>
father’s approach.  They built structural flexibility into the system&lt;br>
from&lt;br>
the start that allows for the various balloons to expand and contract&lt;br>
without&lt;br>
blowing up. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>How to choose between these paradigms?  Where to put the flexibility&lt;br>
and&lt;br>
rigidity?  Where to put the phase-out decisions points?  All these&lt;br>
questions are what makes the problems complex and interesting.  The&lt;br>
answers are often buried in the historical and cultural predicates. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>it looks like i’ll be working on either pre-trial stuff, trial work (assisting not arguing, obviously) or post-trial appellate level work.  at this point we are not sure and it will depend upon the dynamics of the situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i will be getting credit for my work there so there are no problems with my ability to graduate on time, and most importantly I’M GOING TO SIERRA LEONE.  i’ll be abroad from january until june.  i’m not sure what will be happening for the summer, we’ll just have to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>what does the court do:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>        The Special Court for Sierra&lt;br>
        Leone was set up jointly by the Government of Sierra Leone and the&lt;br>
        United Nations. It is mandated to try those who bear the greatest&lt;br>
        responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law&lt;br>
        and Sierra Leonean law committed in the territory of Sierra Leone since&lt;br>
        30 November 1996.&lt;br>
       &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently,&lt;br>
eleven persons associated with all three of the country’s former&lt;br>
warring factions stand indicted by the Special Court. They are charged&lt;br>
with war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations&lt;br>
of international humanitarian law. Specifically, the charges include&lt;br>
murder, rape, extermination, acts of terror, enslavement, looting and&lt;br>
burning, sexual slavery, conscription of children into an armed force,&lt;br>
and attacks on United Nations peacekeepers and humanitarian workers,&lt;br>
among others. Indictments against two other persons were withdrawn in&lt;br>
December 2003 due to the deaths of the accused.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>that is what they do.  needless to say, i’m quite stoked about the opportunity to make a god damn difference.&lt;/p>

return to Vanderbilt this semester.  My job possibility with the Program&lt;br>
Director for USAID down in Colombia is coagulating, but slowly.  I am&lt;br>
going to try to set it up to be down there from January until August,&lt;br>
and use that time to get a semester long externship from Vanderbilt. &lt;br>
Then return and finish up two semesters and be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I came to Law School, as most of you know, I had three career&lt;br>
tracks in mind: environmental lawyer for a plaintiff’s firm,&lt;br>
media/entertainment lawyer centering my practice on the book industry,&lt;br>
and international development (or as I say, helping developing countries&lt;br>
pull themselves out of poverty without mortgaging their environments). &lt;br>
Over the course of the year and this summer I have realized that I&lt;br>
operate best and am most happy in the policy spectrum where I can pull&lt;br>
on my interdisciplinary skills and my abilities to communicate with lay&lt;br>
people.  The minutiae and the drudgery that would be required if I was&lt;br>
in a firm are irreconcilable with my platform, my convictions and my&lt;br>
goals of &amp;ldquo;making a goddamn difference.&amp;rdquo;  I decided earlier this summer&lt;br>
that the third track, international development, was where I needed to&lt;br>
be.  I maintain that position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After making that decision I started to research my employment&lt;br>
opportunities.  Most of the consulting firms and public agencies were&lt;br>
recruiting their entry level employees from the MPP (masters of public&lt;br>
policy) schools around the country.  When I thought about it, an MPP&lt;br>
sounded enticing, and this degree was even more enticing when I started&lt;br>
to pull the curriculum.  So I thought that maybe I should have an MPP&lt;br>
instead of a JD.  But I was behind the power curve and would not be able&lt;br>
to start for a year.  I thought about what to do during the interim. &lt;br>
That was where I was when I last sent out a mass email.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then I have realized from talking to friends, family and mentors&lt;br>
(you all) that it was most advantageous to me to graduate with a JD.  A&lt;br>
JD is one of the most marketable degrees available, and I have already&lt;br>
finished the hardest part of it:  the first year.  A JD is also a&lt;br>
sufficient way to get into international development.  Just because the&lt;br>
firms and agencies pull mostly from MPP schools, that does not mean I&lt;br>
cannot get a job with one of them with a JD.  It seems stupid not to&lt;br>
finish my JD, even though I do not want to be a practicing attorney.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After I made that realization I started to think about the possibility&lt;br>
of doing a joint degree (JD/MPP).  I did more research and found out&lt;br>
that I could get joint degrees at Georgetown and at George Washington. &lt;br>
Both of these schools offered a JD curriculum in environmental and&lt;br>
international law that dwarfs the possibilities Vanderbilt offers, not&lt;br>
to mention their MPP curriculum’s.  Both of these schools are in DC and&lt;br>
the experiential opportunities that would be available to me in DC (with&lt;br>
a Presidential campaign, with the State Department, or with a consulting&lt;br>
firm) dwarf the opportunities that would be available in Nashville. &lt;br>
Both of these schools would allow me to start (if I was accepted as a&lt;br>
transfer student) in January.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a very lucrative possibility.  It is sexy.  It is a gamble.  It&lt;br>
appeals to my sense of adventure, my gambling nature, and my&lt;br>
wanderlust.  It would be the optimal solution.  But it would not be the&lt;br>
best solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems that the best solution, at this point, is to hammer through my&lt;br>
Vanderbilt JD.  The curricular opportunities, if I choose wisely, will&lt;br>
be sufficient to get me where I want to go.  With summers I can get some&lt;br>
modicum of experiential learning to round out my resume.  And, frankly,&lt;br>
it would be easier to not dislodge my entire life, and to just return.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last night I received an email from my connection down in Colombia.  I&lt;br>
thought for a while that this was going to further contemplate my&lt;br>
at-that-point-unresolved decision.  He wants writing samples and it is&lt;br>
looking more and more likely that he will offer me some sort of an&lt;br>
internship.  But it isn’t going to happen quickly.  At this point the&lt;br>
soonest he could reasonably want to see me down there would be October. &lt;br>
If I am offered an internship I will ask to start in January.  This will&lt;br>
allow me to (hopefully) get credit and maintain my matriculation status&lt;br>
as Vanderbilt.  It will keep me on my path to quickly making a&lt;br>
difference.  It would fill in the gaps in my resume (language and&lt;br>
applied experience in international development).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in a sense, I am taking the easy road.  My wanderlust is modestly&lt;br>
disappointed in me, but if I can get a great summer internship next&lt;br>
summer (or eight months in Colombia) then I will just tell him to shut&lt;br>
the hell up.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>that made for a somber drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we arrived at about 3:30 a.m. at the hospital.  she was asleep, but not comatose.  she was responsive, but only with grunts.  she had no conscious muscular control.  when we walked in my mom said that the groans became louder and closer together.  the loudest came when i made a little funny.  i will tell myself she was laughing with us.  it was hard to see her like that.  i couldn’t even hold her hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>now i’ve thought about seeing mamo in this condition, but it was too hard to pursue and so i sloughed it off. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>we left about 4:30 or 5 a.m. and headed to the house.  i was on four hours sleep in four days so i was a bit tired.  i feel asleep in my clothes when we got to the house.  the next thing i knew cam walked in my room.  it was 11:35 friday morning, august 4, 2006.  she had just passed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i washed my face and we all piled into a few cars.  we went to the hospital.  the door was closed when we arrived, mom said they were prepping her (taking out the IV’s and catheters, etc.).  the nurse finished up and opened the door for us.  i walked in and lasted about ten seconds.  i could not look at her.  i was a heap, a wreck, a mess.  i ran out into the hall and wept.  after i recovered i forced myself back into the room. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i sat with her for an hour or two.  people came and went.  we swung from weeping to hillarious laughter.  it was so emotional that the emotions came out forcefully on either side of the spectrum, but never once were they in the middle.  unless you consider numbness and disbelief in the middle.  after everyone left, doni and i were all that remained.  she gave me a minute alone.  i kissed mamo’s forehead.  i told her how much i loved her.  i told her good-bye.  then i gave doni her turn.  i drove home alone and blared this radiohead song that i love over and over.  at one point i pulled to the side of the road, or at least it seemed like the side of the road but i couldn’t tell as i couldn’t see.  i was weeping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the next days went in a blur of preparations, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the funeral came.  i was nervous.  i was unprepared emotionally.  i felt as if i had no more tears to cry, that i was dehydrated to the point of solitude.  i was wrong.  beaner started the service with a wonderful speech, &amp;ldquo;what mamo taught me.&amp;rdquo;  aunt bee ended it with, &amp;ldquo;10 things my mom taught me.&amp;rdquo;  it was beautiful and fitting.  mamo would have approved.  i lasted through the ceremony in my seat only due to the support of my mom, doni and a box of tissues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i drove UD’s truck to the burial.  the spot is nice.  mamo picked it out.  i think it is near bapa, but i thought it would be rude to go see him that day.  plus by the time they lowered her into the ground and covered her in that sweet georgia red clay–the smell of which i will forever associate with playing during the childhood summers spent at her house: gardening with bapa, mud slides with kelley and marla, and generally just being with HER–i was too spent to shed any more tears. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i grieved harder than i ever have in my life.  i wept like i have never wept before.  i always knew it would be this way when she passed on.  she was everything to me.  my rock, my solitude, my beacon, my home.  the loss is especially poignant in that since mom and dad have split her home is my only real home.  the only home that remained stationary in my constantly revolving door of a life.  now that home is just a building.  her sister was over for part of the weekend and every time i looked at her sister from an off angle i saw HER and shuddered.  a few times i thought, mamo isn’t gone, she’s right there talking to mom.  and then it clicked that she was gone.  i will never again get to lay my head in her lap and listen to her read a devotional or a story with the best reading voice i’ve ever heard or will ever hear.  i will never again get to thank her for yet another majestic fresh peach cobbler with her biscuit crust.  i will never again get to see her look when i laid a sarcastic wry comment on her and then to get sucked up into her infectious laugh.  she knew me as well as anyone. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>she never cared how long i had been gone.  it could have been a year in a war or fifteen minutes to go to the store.  she always welcomed me with the same smile.  now i must let her go with a similar smile, and relish what she gave me.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, this has massive, long term implications for US Policy in our hemisphere.  In my mind it is more impactful than the Cuban missile crisis for this reason:  Cuba was an isolate proxy with limited economic power.  Venezuela has a relatively stable government, Chavez is fairly entrenched for the foreseeable future, their oil reserves enable the country to pursue a long-term, viable economy.  Cuba had none of these, they relied completely on the Soviets for whatever materiel and training support needed.  Ven on the other hand will not have to rely on anyone for the materiel support or the economic support.  They will have to get the education and training in order to really utilize any advanced weapon systems, but for state actors that is easy enough to achieve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real problem is that to date the US has successfully kept any of the countries in our hemisphere from becoming a real military powerhouse unless their governments are imperialistic proxies and beholden to us.  Ven is a wildcard and Chavez’s recent efforts to expand his power and influence in the region will only be amplified if he can get his hands on some symbols of nationalistic power and entrance into a more elite group. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is too much here and I wish that I would be seeing more on it, this has large not in my backyard implications as well as (and I may be being a bit fatalistic) it may signal the beginning of the end of the monroe doctrine (which would crumble not from external pressure from the rest of the world, but from internal pressure from the &amp;ldquo;protectorate&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the following excerpt is from a &lt;a href="http://www.cfr.org/publication/11123/india_nuclear_deal.html">council on foreign relations publication&lt;/a> on the nuclear deal the US cut with India to establish a commercial (thereby non-weapons grade or adaptable) nuclear deal where the US will help India establish a nuclear program.  i think that these types of programs are positives in stable governments, but we shouldn’t be rushing to make them.  in a stable government transparency breeds accountability.  but in an unstable government such a program would merely injest an unnecessary skill set into a population group that may use it for non-commercial practices.  i think that if we use this as a carrot/stick approach in our outlook to developing followup programs with other developing countries we will be OK.  what i don’t really think is right, and i think what this guy is arguing, is that this sort of deal should be a paradigm for our future energy dealings with other nations.  i hesitate to christen any sort of &amp;ldquo;deal&amp;rdquo; as a paradigm when it is between countries.  treaties and intergovernmental contracts are not bridges that flow from a single paradigm and are modified to fit the specifics of the dirt structure and width that must be spanned.  these these are too societally dependent and when we try to establish paradigms or iconic deals we only set ourselves up for failures b/c we will inevitably discount the next deal and not thoroughly think through all the parameters that must be analyzed in the negotiation phase.  in short we will just base it on the last deal, b/c that one worked.  this laziness seems to happen a lot in politics and foreign relations and what i am wholeheartedly opposed to.  so here is the quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;h5 id="beyond-india-engaging-developing-countries">Beyond India: Engaging Developing Countries&lt;/h5>
&lt;p>Until now, developing countries have adamantly refused to limit their&lt;br>
emissions of greenhouse gases. These countries are wary that the possible high&lt;br>
costs of climate change mitigation will jeopardize their development goals. The&lt;br>
result of that opposition is the CDM—a system that compensates developing&lt;br>
countries for the full extra cost of any policies to control emissions. The CDM&lt;br>
was a good idea in principle, but in practice it is not working well. The scheme&lt;br>
has become mired in red tape as countries and investors try to establish their&lt;br>
baseline levels of emissions and the reduction in emissions from each project.&lt;br>
(The difference between the baseline and the reduced level is the key to the CDM&lt;br>
concept—that difference becomes a credit that can be used to offset emission&lt;br>
obligations elsewhere in the world, such as in Europe’s emission trading&lt;br>
system). The problems have encouraged gaming and they have caused CDM investors&lt;br>
to focus on activities that are easy to quantify and which are marginal in&lt;br>
nature. Indeed, energy projects account for just 17% of the CDM pipeline. Almost&lt;br>
none of the energy projects are of the type that will lead to fundamental&lt;br>
changes in countries’ energy systems.&lt;a href="#_ftn5">[5]&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the India nuclear deal is successful, it will frame a new approach to&lt;br>
engaging developing countries in a climate strategy. This approach would focus&lt;br>
on finding game-changing policies that align with reluctant countries’&lt;br>
interests.&lt;a href="#_ftn6">[6]&lt;/a> Rather than involving hundreds of&lt;br>
small and marginal projects, this style of engagement would focus on just a&lt;br>
handful of large pivotal actions involving just a few critical countries. This&lt;br>
concept is incidentally at the core of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean&lt;br>
Development and Climate, whose six members, including India and the U.S.,&lt;br>
account for half the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. That Partnership has&lt;br>
promise, but it remains young. Success with this nuclear deal could offer a&lt;br>
credible example of practical actions that the Partnership could encourage.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I admit to not having researched the &amp;ldquo;Partnership&amp;rdquo; that he cites at the end of the passage.  I know this much, if we keep basing our energy requirements upon coal we are not really going to get anywhere.  keeping coal production stationary without anything more is only going to hurt, even if we keep up with rising energy demands by substituting that additional delta with nuclear (therefore non-carbon emitting) energy.  this is for two reasons, one: the coal is going to likely get dirtier.  this has been happening over the past three decades as coal producers have seen a decrease in the BTU’s per ton of coal b/c it is not as &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; of coal.  most of the established mines are beginning to get the dregs and new exploration and development costs capital.  if i was in the energy industry (which is oxymoronic) i would sink all my capital investment money that i could spare into something else since the political and regulatory regime is inevitably going to get rockier in the next five to ten years.  there is too much risk there.  this flows into the second reason why we need to reduce and not to contain the amount of coal we use in energy production.  people (and the more likely players in my model, at least in america: the insurance companies, once the legal system actually holds them accountable for paying for the hurricanes and stops them from evading those payouts) are going to get sick of it.  they are going to eventually hold some political system accountable when the links are clearly established and the green left finally puts it all together into a cohesive package (rove style).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ok that is all for now.  this is deeply integrated in my mind: enviroments, trade, geopolitics, policies, economics, societies and cultural sytems.  i hope to keep blogging more on these themes and less on other banalities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>but now i’ve gotten a break.  yesterday i wrote all afternoon at my coffeeshop, then did yoga for the first time in three alcohol and smoke laden days, then ate dinner with two lady-friends then came home to fall asleep to MTV banalities. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>today i spent much of the time up at the maroon bells, the nation’s most photographed mountain with a couple of friends and one child.  the kid was fucking crazy well behaved.  it restoked my uncle fire.  in case you didn’t know i’ll be an uncle in approximately 7.5 months.  SA-WEET.  then i came  home to type out and make some of the edits that have been pen changed for weeks now.  so finally we have another Wading chapter.  enjoy it if you wanna.  off to stretch my shit out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>it was more violent than the first, and there was less of johnny depp’s witticisms.  the special effects were tremendous, the costume/set designers should both be oscar contenders.  the plot line was much more linear than the first movie.  there was also a different narrative arc that is the archetype for these movies, the tension was frontloaded and then like a good mile runner they just tried to ride out the momentum until the end.  i left feeling….odd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but there were a few things off about the movie.  first, it is long.  second, it is gross, which was fine but i thought once it got around the soccer mom circuit that it could dampen the movie’s core demographic of 12-15 year old boys (evidently i was initially proven wrong since they are projecting it to smash spider man’s opening weekend record, but we’ll see how long the movie’s legs are).  third, the ending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>don’t get me wrong, the ending is fucking terrific.  terrific.  just odd.  i understand that it is the middle movie in a trilogy, but disney is taking a different tactic than most of the studios who have produced trilogies with what they have done with the second movie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>for some reason i kept picking out homage’s to other great movies.  there was a scene between depp and kiera that if you changed from pirates to outer space could have been taken directly from the first star wars trilogy.  some of the fight scenes were probably homages to flying daggers and other ground breaking movies from the kung fu genre.  but that is to be expected, hollywood can only be so original, so long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>all in all i have no complaints.  it was a different movie going experience, which i suspect is why its rotten tomatoes rating is lower than i expected it to be.  i’m not sure what the critics have liked or disliked about the movie, but there is plenty on both sides of that issue to pinpoint.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>go. &lt;/p>

last night i went to THIS.  i flashed back to driving to the keys for one of my first times with all the windows down and gb with me.  i was screaming ac/dc at the top of my lungs.  she was laughing her ass off. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.hellsbelles.info/">http://www.hellsbelles.info/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this is a lesbian ac/dc cover band.  there is no other way to say this:  they rock fucking hard.  the chick who covers angus spent most of the show in a black bra and the little plaid skirt.  it was hillarious.  they are from seattle. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>my love of ac/dc did not begin at the beginning.  in fact as a youngster i was a bit intimidated by metal and harder music.  i remember mowing the lawn one sunday with my walkman on listening to my namesake doing his countdown and doctor feelgood came on.  it rocked but it did not really give me a good buzz.  i was pretty equivocal about it in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then came jon meert.  jon meert was my friend jason’s older brother.  the circular part of this story is that jason lives in seattle currently, but that is neither here nor there.  jon meert was a year older than us, but about five years more physically mature.  i think he had a full chest of hair when jason and i were in seventh grade.  he was a bear of a man when we were growing up.  sometimes those that seem large when you see them years later they suddenly are much smaller.  not jon.  when i saw him two or so years ago he was still the large, hairy man that i remembered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>jon drove his mother’s thunderbird.  not just a thunderbird, it was a fucking firebird with removable panels, t-top, black.  it was sick.  it was loud.  it was dirty.  it was low.  it was fast.  jason and i loved making jon (who was sixteen at the time and working at blimpie’s in naples) drive us to the movies or to the beach so we could ride in that fucker.  me, being the late bloomer, was pretty small and didn’t mind riding in the back, as long as jon drove that stick shift fucking car fast with the panels off so my hair can flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that was the summer when i fell in love with rock n roll.  there was something about that car that legitimized GNR, metallica and ac/dc in a way that i had not been able to comprehend before.  there was something incomplete in my picture of rock n roll before jon and his firebird showed me what i means to rock.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so jon meert.  for those about to rock.  i salute you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ps-the lead singer was probably the sexiest lesbian i’ve ever seen.  too bad her DSL’s are going to waste.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>this week has been busy, but good.  the woman i’m working for knows MANY MANY people who are very very well connected.  this weekend we are to meet McCain, i’m going to give him a copy of shooter.  next week even more people will be in town.  i’m told we’ll be heading up to a safehouse for some meetings of the intelligence committee.  it will be interesting.  one of her friends is quite high in the state department and lives in columbia doing development work.  &amp;ldquo;he is always looking for lawyers, especially.&amp;rdquo;  i work through the rum fog to remember her telling me the other night.  good.  cause i’m always looking for a job, especially.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>tomorrow night i’m going to hear a lesbian ac/dc cover band.  i’ll give you a review later, although i’m not sure how it could be anything but awesome.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>when we use it those that do not KNOW often ask for a definition or description.  up till now it had been hard for me to point to an iconic description pulled from pop culture that can help.  this difficulty is often compounded by the fact that if you are asking me what a gaper is it is likely that you are one, and i being the sensitive soul that i am do no want to unnecessarily hurt your feelings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but now i have one.  i will now attempt to describe to you a gaper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i had been up on steamboat for the first time.  i really liked the town.  it was like the rest of these mountains that by now i know quite well, except for much of the pompacity of them was conspicuosly absent in steamboat.  i don’t know why.  maybe because it is so far off the beaten path.  there were a few pretentious looking places but for the most part they were hidden behind gates.  all i could see were the millions of kids playing little league and families riding bikes along the river that flows through the town. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there is the moutain that didn’t look that tough but a veteran told me there was plenty of off-piste stuff, great tree skiing and some in bounds stuff that was fun and pretty tough.  there was a river with at least three play waves that i could see as i walked along it.  that was at a flow that wasn’t great since it’s been a warm spring and runoff happened for the most part before i got there, and it is pretty dry.  there were a few crags that i could see around, some with people on them, some without.  it seemed like an ideal place to me.  all the things without all the attitude.  quite a few real cowboys, like in jackson.  cheaper than jackson or aspen or vail.  the tourists that i could see, this being the weekend before the fourth there were many, were all from casper or denver.  that gives them legitimacy.  if you’re going to be a city dweller you at least have some authenticity if you come from wyoming or from denver, at least you have the rebuttable presumption of authenticity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i decided to head up to this one falls.  i did not know until the road deadended into a forest service pay booth conveniently located around a corner and without a turn around.  i had vehicles in front of and behind me so my only choices were to turn around in the small parking lot on the other side of the booth and head back into town or pay the fee and actually see the falls that were apparently pretty kool, despite the unexpected fees.  i debated while the vehicle in front of me fucked around with some stuff and decided to pay the fee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i parked and grabbed my nalgene and started walking.  there was really only one way to go, but there was a nice host there at the small map that i glanced at that was willing to give directions to lost souls.  i thought it was a nice way to earn a free place to camp your RV for the summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i walked along this cement path for like 300 yards to the overlook of the falls dressed in khaki shorts, a t-shirt, flip flops, sunglasses and a nalgene looped to my finger.  my other hand in my pocket.  i mean it was 300 yards along a cement &amp;ldquo;path.&amp;rdquo;  it wasn’t taxing.  i sat on a nice bench that i figured my $5 was going to help maintain for a while pondering life and waterflows and mosquitoes and whether or not i really had contracted west nile disease. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>after a bit i decided to get up and head down to the base of the falls.  the overlook path had one side path that was not cement, but was asphalt, and therefore much more tricky for people i guess, that took you to the bottom of the canyon where you picked up a &amp;ldquo;gasp&amp;rdquo; dirt trail that ran for 200 yards or something along the river floor to near the base of the falls. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the entire area was about half a square mile and enclosed in a larger canyon.  there were lots of trees around but from the lookout area i was easily able to piece together the three trails that the small area contained.  i flipped back towards the asphalt path and i came upon my icon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>he was dressed in hiking boots, brand new REI shorts, a patagonia capilene layer and a nicearc teryx daypack that was jammed with god knows what.  he was conferring with his wife/friend/sister who was similarly attired.  they were conferring over a MAP.  a fucking MAP.  i paraphrase but i overheard something like this.  &amp;ldquo;hmm, where do you think we should go, honey?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;well, we’ve been to the overlook, maybe we should head to the bottom of the falls, how do we get there?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;i don’t know, let me pull out my GPS to see where we are and then let’s plot our course to the bottom using this handy map the nice lady at the parking lot gave us.&amp;rdquo;  i do not understand how these three trails could have made for ANY discussion much less this discussion that lasted from the time they were in sound until the time i couldn’t hear them any more as i flipped along the asphault trail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i flipped down the winding switchbacks to the dirt trail at the bottom.  the river path was jammed with hippies and japanese people.  but there was one couple there who had an adolescent nephy.  suddenly i forgot everything and just missed bailey.  i was sad as i walked back to the car not because people are idiots but because i missed my dog.  there wasn’t a strong resemblance since that dog was actually in the water and wasn’t having the shakes due to his fear of the water like bailey would have, but nonetheless bailey was a good boy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>i was on an early morning hike to the top of this mountain.  the first part of the hike i could tell was about three or four miles of a fairly even, though uphill, approach to the mountain part.  it was shaded by many varietals of nice evergreens that i did not know what their latin or american or aboretal names were.  douglas firs?  pine bark fingerlings?  beetle upchuck prostitutes?  i never know these things.  i never have.  although one of the things that i did resolve was to become a better naturalist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that is all beside the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so i was walking on this approach with just me and my camelback containing my sketchbook, a pen, an apple and some water.  it was completely peaceful as i was nearing the end of the timbered approach.  it was late enough that the birds were not as active as they had been nearer the beginning of the hike.  it was still early enough that the bugs were not out in the few meadows that i had passed through.  all in all quiet and beautiful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i was walking along and heard a CRACK up ahead.  i was a bit startled at first, but then i realized that the brook that i was walking beside contained a waterfall just ahead of me.  i heard the distinct waterfall noise after the crack.  i discounted the crack as the waterfall carrying a stick down it and breaking it.  i’ve seen it happen; water is an amazingly powerful substance (the floods in the NE prove that, inter alia!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i took about three more steps before i heard another, louder CRACK.  i looked up.  this confirmed that it must be an animal moving around.  this did not really bother me.  already on the trip i had seen elk, deer, foxes, bears and other, smaller rodents and marmots.  i saw a deer running parallel to my direction.  &lt;em>that’s cool.  a deer is running.&lt;/em>  i thought.  but then i wondered what he/she was running to/from.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>it was probably just spooked by something&lt;/em>, i was still too far away to have been the instrument of the spooking.  so it wasn’t me, but i didn’t put things together quickly enough.  i walked two or three more steps before i could see the full flank of the deer running.  before i had only caught a glimpse of it before it had gone behind some foliage. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>then i saw a flash of gray.  i was not really sure what it was going on so i just stood statutesquely. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the gray and the deer were both running and then they turned and started running down the trail TOWARDS ME.  they came around the corner of the trail and down the straightaway towards me.  the corner was about 20 yards away and there it was, a gray WOLF and a deer.  the wolf was snarling. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>now i know that it was a wolf because there have been some releases in this part of colorado within the past five years as they try to capitalize on the popularity that was created by the repopulation efforts that happened up by cam in jackson a while ago.  plus i could see the fucking thing.  its face was a wolf’s face.  it was not a fox.  it was not a dog. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>he looked mean as he ran.  there was the snarling and the full force of its momentum as it came careening down the fucking trail, RIGHT AT ME.  i was not scared.  i was petrified, but not out of fear.  out of concern.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>see the wolf was being chased by the deer.  i’m not fucking around.  the deer was chasing the wolf.  it was the craziest, most disney-worthy scene.  bambi’s mama had her head low as she ran chasing that wolf.  there was a cacophonous shattering of my peace and i couldn’t really make out all the noises but it sounded like the deer was grunting.  i’m not sure if i was hearing things, or merely not able to separate all the sounds that were going on.  there was lots of crashing and thrashing and grunting and snarling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so these two animals were both obviously scared out of their minds.  this is what i was thinking about as they came running towards me.  i did not want to move and startle them further.  maybe they would form an unholy alliance and attack me together, the wolf turning my calfs into roast beef for bambi’s herbivorous conversion while the deer grunted and head butted my chest into tender loin shanks for the wolf to breakfast upon.  so i continued to stand there with my nueroses rock-solid in order to minimize my inpact upon the situation. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>plus i like to leave no trace when i’m in the backcountry.  the trace i’d like to leave the least is some of my body parts on the trail or in the form of wolf scat. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>when they were within twenty feet of me the wolf took a hard right turn.  his swift ninety degree turn was a big quick for the deer that was chasing him, but bambi’s mom made the turn quick enough.  i continued to stand still while they started to do large laps and circles around me. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>for no less than two minutes, one-hundred and twenty seconds, i stood there in full rapture of nature’s embracing of irony.  i did not really know what to do.  wolves are pack animals.  so did the gray phantom of jack london fame have mates (victorian version) or mates (aussie version) around that were up on the woods surrounding me, waiting for me to make my move.  but if these repopulations were just isolated animals or couples than it is likely that there would not be another around and that this guy was on his own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in either case i had to wait, at a minimum, until they left my immediate vicinity.  when they did and they were doing laps on the other side of the creek, i started stepping out of there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>running would be a bad idea, obviously.  maybe the wolf would abandon its hunger for bambi and suddenly acquire a hunger for casey.  running would only incite his BIOS to chase and chomp.  but i wanted to get out of the area nonetheless for assorted reasons that are likely to be self-evident based upon the above discourse, so i walked quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i finished the rest of the approach without incident and began to walk up the main part of the mountain.  it was not a technical climb, it was merely a hike.  most of it was littered with high altitude grasses and flowers of the eidelwies variety.   i refrained from performing julie andrews impersonations. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the top part of the mountain was very shaley.  lots of them were very loosely forming the top of the mountain.  the view was one of the most incredible i’ve seen in colorado or anywhere else.  the sky was a deep blue, there were at least twelve high mountain lakes that i could see.  there were four rivers that i could see.  i could see higher mountains from steamboat springs (i think) to vail (i’m pretty sure) along the corridor where the road runs between the two.  there were flowers and rocks and grasses.  a few minutes before topping out i saw a few mountain goats doing there thing.  they were like mine, a family of four.  although it is hard to imagine my father lithely jumping tenuous rocks as if they were our living room mexican tiles firmly grouted into a cement floor, but you can only stretch the metaphors so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i signed the summit log and started to head back down.  i wanted to find a shelter from the biting wind to stop and eat my apple.  before i had a chance i heard some howls.  i was positive that they were wolf howls.  they definitely were not coyotes, i know what those sound like from when those fucking rodents used to get too close to our shit when i lived in the stumps.  foxes don’t really make noises.  i guess they could have been wild dogs, but those are not really prevalent in colorado.  so i’m quite certain that there had been a pack. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i began to fantasize that the howls were rebukes for the wolf that i had seen earlier was a young warrior who was out on walkabout and to prove his manhood and be deemed a warrior of the pack he had to bring back a bambi, or a casey, and the howls were not howls of joys for the iniation rites had become complete and now it was a festive afternoon in the woods.  i thought that the howls were darker than that.  eventually the wolf must have failed and was returning.  the rest of the pack was less worried about not being able to eat as they were in the failure of the young man.  now what were they to do with him?  put him with the squaws to boil water and grind meal, i decided.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the rest of the day went by quickly, except for on the descent when i passed near the place i was sure to perform the julie andrews renditions that i had avoided singing from the mountaintops.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>i was walking around this gigantic lake that was engorged by new deal politics more than the bellies of those beat fuckers who had to dam the damn thing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there was a small trail that i was not sure if it was a human trail or a deer trail, and i felt guilty for if it was the latter maybe i was changing many years of animal patterns because they wouldn’t come this way if they could smell early morning human who has not showered for a few days and doesn’t usually smell that good to begin with. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there was the usual flora around that i had seen numerous times on numerous hikes.  but then i saw a flower that i had not seen before. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it was something straight out of my doodles.  all straight lines and angles that only an engineer’s mind would appreciate.  there was a back-flower of moderately intense blue and a fore-flower of yellow.  it was like two starfish of two colors and of two sizes were stacked on top of one another with the smaller on top and twisted just a bit.  it was beautiful.  for some reason, and i must have seen these flowers before, it was really engaging.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i wanted to get a closer look at it, but i was leaving no trace and was locked into the pathway.  the pathway got close to the flower so i followed it until it got there.  i looked back at the flower after averting my eyes to get closer.  when i knew i was the closest i would be to the flower i squatted down because i’m indian like that.  but when i finally was closest to the flower i was shading the damn thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i became frozen by indecision.  if i never moved the damn thing would wither from lack of sunshine.  if i moved away i would not get to see my flower change and grow.  i did not know what to do so i just moved on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it was not purposeful.  i did not mean to shade the damn thing.  i just wanted to see it.  it wasn’t my fault that the sun was at an angle such that my closeness shaded it.  but yet that is what happened….aren’t metaphors sometimes perfect?&lt;/p>

&lt;p> this week&lt;br>
the claim preclusion opinion that i drafted, and was circulated, was&lt;br>
returned. the comments and feedback were&lt;br>
interesting and varied greatly from the judge who is on the campaign trail&lt;br>
right now who signed off without a single pen change to the judge who&lt;br>
“couldn’t” comment because there was “too much work” to be done on it (she also&lt;br>
did not make a single pen change) to actually helpful comments on some of the&lt;br>
reworking of the issues. it made me&lt;br>
think of something a guy said to me last summer. last summer i was a panelist on the aspen&lt;br>
summer words writer’s festival and after we finished the panel i was at the bar&lt;br>
having a drink with one of the other panelists who was a magazine writer. we were talking about editing and he told me&lt;br>
something that stuck. he said “i think&lt;br>
of the editing process as a negotiation between the editor and myself.” that seems an incredibly apt metaphor here&lt;br>
where all the judges either have to sign off on the opinion or draft a new&lt;br>
opinion (which, of course, they are not jumping at the opportunity to do since&lt;br>
they each have their own caseload of opinions to write). i was laughing about that comment to today as&lt;br>
my supervising staff attorney was putting her little side comments on whether&lt;br>
or not i should incorporate wordings and phrasings from a particular&lt;br>
judge. it was evident who had the&lt;br>
negotiating power among them and who did not. “she is a great editor since she was a former english teacher.” [read, incorporate her changes word for&lt;br>
word.] “she just rewrote it the way she&lt;br>
would have originally wrote it were she working on the opinion.” [read, incorporate whatever you think is&lt;br>
valid and discard the rest.] “now this&lt;br>
is incredibly unhelpful.” [read, don’t&lt;br>
even bother to look through it.] &lt;/p>
&lt;p>when we were going over the changes&lt;br>
that she actually wanted me to incorporate she made a comment that i thought&lt;br>
was incredibly helpful thing for me to keep in mind. it went something like this: “you know, you being a published author you&lt;br>
obviously brought with you a certain style for story telling. but when you write it is like you keep&lt;br>
forgetting that you are writing a legal document until the last second you&lt;br>
throw in a legal turn of phrase. it is&lt;br>
really jarring.” i pressed her on the&lt;br>
subject as i was really interested in this observation, mainly because i think&lt;br>
she is right. i asked her to clarify&lt;br>
whether she meant that it was bad that i was writing in a “story-telling way”&lt;br>
or was it bad that i was throwing in legal phrasings or was it bad that my&lt;br>
legal phrasings seemed tacked on and there was no smooth transition between the&lt;br>
two styles. she said that the hardest&lt;br>
thing was the jarring nature and that i need to make the transitions smoother&lt;br>
and stick in one “voice” or “style” for a complete section of a document and&lt;br>
then if i need to change the voice or style to make the transitions smoother or&lt;br>
at least at the beginning of a paragraph. i asked her to show me examples and she did. mainly what she was pinpointing were places&lt;br>
where my writing style was colloquial and simple but instead of using a&lt;br>
colloquial or simple word i would throw in legalese. her observation was dead on as i started to&lt;br>
review some stuff i do that. so it is&lt;br>
something for me to work on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but i was thinking today about why&lt;br>
and/or whether there should be a noticeable difference between the two writing&lt;br>
styles. i mean, there obviously is a&lt;br>
tangible difference between the two, if there were not then you would have one&lt;br>
job instead of two. i guess much of it&lt;br>
is historical/cultural. the profession&lt;br>
developed with some sort of a need to prove itself and one of the ways that i&lt;br>
think the legal profession justified its existence and filtered out those who&lt;br>
would gain entry to its ranks was by adopting new words, forms of speech and&lt;br>
phrasings. the legal community seems to&lt;br>
pride itself on these distinguishing characteristics. “it is what separates us from the normal&lt;br>
people,” or something to that effect. but, frankly, i think that that is crap. if there is an easier way to say something that does not require you&lt;br>
shoehorning your writing into a certain form why should you have to rearrange&lt;br>
your writing to a form that outside the legal community most people would think&lt;br>
is ineffective and unappealing stylistically just because “it is what judges&lt;br>
and senior partners expect.” (i&lt;br>
reflected on the quote that chicago manual style likes by churchill that is an&lt;br>
incredibly hard to read sentence where he was making the point that often times&lt;br>
it is just easier to end a sentence with a preposition.) i was thinking about that for a bit and then&lt;br>
it occurred to me that that is no different than anything else. all this boils down to is knowing your&lt;br>
audience, an elementary tenant of writing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>my judge has told me in the past&lt;br>
that he is a very story oriented writer. he knows that he is in the majority, but still thinks that it is ok to&lt;br>
put a little bit of personality into your opinions. as such he let me go with the opinion in my&lt;br>
voice that (stylistically at least) fits with his philosophy on legal&lt;br>
writing. a litigant or staffer that&lt;br>
knows that can be “looser” with his or her writing style when they present&lt;br>
something to him. other judges here at&lt;br>
this court are much more stylistically formal and they require more formal&lt;br>
reasoning and style out of the written documents they receive. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i guess it simplifies to there&lt;br>
isn’t so much of a conflict between the two writing styles as there is between&lt;br>
the audiences. if i had never been&lt;br>
enabled by my judge to “tell a story, write this opinion like you’re writing it&lt;br>
to your mom,” then i never would have had a conflict. i would have just writing very impersonal and&lt;br>
formal. the staff attorney is a more&lt;br>
formalist person and writer, but she knew that my style is more similar to the&lt;br>
judge’s than it is to hers and she was ok with that. i realized later that what she was really&lt;br>
saying to me is to stick with one thing and be brave enough to continue&lt;br>
that. just because i’m writing a legal&lt;br>
document doesn’t necessitate that i must insert legal phrasings just to lend&lt;br>
them authority. i guess she was saying&lt;br>
that if your argument and reasoning is solid (which most seemed to think that&lt;br>
it was) then you don’t need to bolster it with words and phrasings that&lt;br>
obviously do not fit with the rest of your document.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>places</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-06-16-places/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-06-16-places/</guid><description>&lt;p>i think that how i leaves places reminds me of how i break up with women . . . tentatively, with an eye towards salvaging something from the experience in an effort to reinforce that my decision was the right one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i am not prone to regrets, but i am prone to self-reflection in an effort to refine why and how i make decisions so i make them better in the future.  those two things may seem irreconcilable to many but they seem fundamentally different to me.  maybe they are just different ways to express the same thing.  yet i’m not a backwards looker, usually.  in an effort to retain my youth i try to retain my sense of discovery, wanderlust and dreaminess. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>those broad generalizations aside i’m leaving austin soon, on sunday in fact.  this will be my final weekend here and i’m not sure if it will be jammed with activities or jammed with a lack of activites.  it seems that many of taylor’s friends are out of the tiz-own so it may just be him and i man-dating throughout the weekend.  that is fine with me as we truly get along well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then it is off to see bri for a two or so days and then i’ll spend the remainder of the week off the power grid in the mountains hiking and writing and relaxing. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>writing.  i’ve done a SHITLOad of it at work and haven’t really wanted to do it when i’ve come home in the evenings.  needless to say i haven’t gotten past sketches of characters and a rough chapter by chapter run through of the turrow book.  i am past much of my existential crisis for now and feel comfortable in the decision that i’ve made to pursue my dreams of development and not of money and posh firm lifestyles doing shit that i couldn’t care less about.  that has freed up my mind for reflection on the book.  i really like how it is starting to sift out.  we’ll have to see how it comes out on the paper.  i plan on writing (as in with pen and notebook) for much of my time in the woods next week.  i have to return to my discipline of writing and not let my adhd get the better of my mind.  &amp;ldquo;oo look at the snowfields i could stare at them….pretty elk…pretty pretty el…those fucking flies better fucking leave me alone….fuckers….o yeah where was i?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~ # ~&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>no thanks, i&amp;#8217;ll pass</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-06-12-no-thanks-ill-pass/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-06-12-no-thanks-ill-pass/</guid><description>&lt;p>this weekend i almost became a marine….again. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>a friend that i have known forever came down from ft worth to visit for the night.  we were talking about him going back to the sandbox for seven months.  he is going with a civil affairs group that will be doing civil/military liasoning, straight civil affairs (government establishment, police coordination, building schools, making sure there is power and water, helping USAID distribute the moneys for aid, ensuring people get paid, etc.). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this seemed fortuitous to me.  ever since i’ve made my decision to hone in my career choice and stop browsing the shelves at the Walmart SuperCenter, instead going to the little boutique in the strip mall, the focus is now where it was when i came to law school.  however the decision is pretty tentative.  it is scary in that it will be hard to get into this world from my little nashville school.  it will be hard to network my way into a job anyway.  it is also scary in that i am not gauranteed anything as far as cash is concerned. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>but then this news that the_comedian was tossing my way about his job and how short-staffed they were seemed like the fortiuty.  if i took that job: (1)  i would make BANK–something like $55k tax free.  that means my debts would be paid off, my car would also be paid off and i could relax on the finances since vandy will assist with my student loans if i make under a certain threshhold (which is likely). (2) i would learn ARABIC.  this is key as a resume point, as lack of language skills is currently the biggest hold in the thing that would keep me from doing what i wanted to do.  (3) i would be able to NETWORK.  going to iraq again would let me meet lots of people who are in USAID who may be able to help my long-term career prospects, but also it would be like a neon sign on my resume that i’m not scared (the first time i went aside) of hostile places, that i can function in amorphous situations and it would lend credibility when i say this is what i want to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>those three positives seemed infallible to me for much of the weekend, which, admittedly, was spent in a drunken haze.  after the_comedian left i started to really think.  i smoked about 8900 cigarettes this weekend just to clear the air of my mind and try to focus on the negatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then i called activist and miami to run this by them.  to put it mildly they were not anxious to encourage me.  there is the obvious security risk.  but that is negligible to me.  miami told me that there would be no way she could forgive herself if i was to not make it and if she did anything to encourage me to return.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>after talking to them and balancing out the momentum from having the_comedian pitch it to me i really thought long and hard about it.  there are two things that are going to stop me from taking the job.  two arguments that sold the passing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(1) although arabic would look great on my resume in that it is a high need language by most everyone, if i put that on my resume and an organization hires me based upon that then i may be pigeonholed into that region as my specialty region.  now i know that this is how these things work, and i know that i’m going to have to narrow my focus down to one region soon in order to really focus my career goals.  i’m not ready to say that the arabic region is where i want to focus.  i’m not ready to say that it is not either.  the unfortunate thing is that the country within the region that is most fascinating is also the most closed off: iran.  and speaking arabic isn’t going to go very far in a farsi speaking country anyway.  the persian intellectual tradition is fascinating, but i’m not really anxious to get into the arabic cultural tradition.  that isn’t a completely true statement.  what i mean is that i’m not ready to focus on that area at the cost of all others in the developing world.  so there is the pigeonholing argument.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(2) is the dangerous aspect of the job.  now i’m not being a pansy here.  maybe i am, but i don’t think that i am.  this is the thing if i was going to go back with an infantry unit to do infantry stuff i would be surrounded by warriors.  doing this job i’ll be stationed in a small to medium sized town (i’m thinking this is the scenario) working with the locals.  probably staying in the police station or commuting from a nearby base.  but i would only be surrounded by my small team of marines and we would be out there in al anbar province doing it.  the thing that makes this more dangerous than just normal infantry patroling is that you are the symbol to that town of the american occupation.  so if there is anyone disillusioned with the american presence in the country for the many reasons that i can think of to be upset with it, you are their target.  no matter how much good you do if something bad happens you are going to get blamed, you will become the target.  this really crescendoes the danger above the normal level for these teams.  although the security concern was a concern to come later it is also extremely salient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and then was the final kicker above the two things that had siezed the momentum:  i just can’t put my family and friends through that again.  it isn’t fair.  it is too selfish.  just like the story i wrote: you don’t really have time or the capacity to get scared, but they are freaked out everytime the phone rings or a knock on the door comes for the entire time i’m gone.  if i don’t HAVE to go then i really can’t do that to them again.  i think the stress really would send mamo to her grave. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>so in the end i passed on the deal, no matter how good of a career move it would have been long term.  the skills and networking and money that i would have gotten by taking the job were simply not enough to overcome the pigeonholing, the focusing of the danger and the stress upon my family and friends. &lt;/p>

side of the big, round, blue salt container.  everytime bri and/or i would&lt;br>
cook i would just look at it and think, &amp;ldquo;shit isn’t that&lt;br>
self-evident,&amp;rdquo; or the equivalent of that thought would enter my young mind&lt;br>
for a pinball session of bouncing around.  eventually i asked my mother&lt;br>
who told me that this company had placed an additive in the salt that makes it&lt;br>
pour out in response to older salts that would absorb the humidity in the air&lt;br>
and clump up in humid environs.  then it made sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so lots have changed, but, i think, for the good.  i may be an ass&lt;br>
hole, but at least i’m being honest to myself.  that may not be a very&lt;br>
good balm for those around me, but it is all i’ve got.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>UPDATE: more things have changed since the last post, which i took down and replaced with this, such as an addition to our community.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>[]: &lt;a href="http://www.thepuffychairmovie.com/screenings.html">http://www.thepuffychairmovie.com/screenings.html&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>there was one scene where they had just finished a long day’s drive and the boy is tired.  they climb into bed and all he wants to do is sleep, she is glowing from him even asking her to accompany him on the trip and in general and presumably had been sleeping the entire time .  she turns to him after he has expired the light and asks him if he loves her, &amp;ldquo;yes, baby, of course.&amp;rdquo; he  manages to mumble.  &amp;ldquo;what is it about me that you love?&amp;rdquo; she asks.  he is so taken aback that she wants to have a serious conversation that he immediately is put on the defensive and is ostensibly thinking &amp;ldquo;what the fuck did i do wrong now?&amp;rdquo; she is presumably bolstered by the intimacy (whether faux or real, whether imposed by the societal implications of many family journeys or not) that a road trip inevitably entails and wants to bask in that glow with conversation, the feminine fuel.  but his tanks are dry and all he wants to do is to get some fucking sleep. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i flashed back to every relationship i’ve ever had.  it was a magnificent scene.  i thought that the beginning was fucking brilliant, the middle was honestly great, and the ending was OK. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>first, i worked really fucking hard last semester at developing and refining my written communications, apparently i didn’t work smarter since my legal writing grade dropped.  but i really thought that i was getting the hang of it, apparently everyone else was too.  i also worked really hard on the substantive law (the rules as applied to the class, basically the classwork) this semester, and especially towards finals.  i knew that stuff backwards and forwards, as well as anyone in my study group.  going into the conlaw final one of my groupmates told Yale that I had a strong chance of booking it.  i got a B.  so i know that i knew the substance of the class and i know that i worked really hard on the precision of my wording and the succinctity of my arguments.  alas, it only sort of paid off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>second, all my desires are to do things that really do require better grades than i’m getting.  wanna work in a city that does NOT hire vanderbilt grads?  yes!  Portland.  better be near the top.  shit.  wanna work in a big NY, posh law firm?  sort of.  better be near the top.  shit.  wanna be a legal academic?  yes.  better be near the top.  shit. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>so i was burnt about it.  i rationalized all of the why’s, mainly focusing on my lack of undergraduate preparation.  i mean shit, i’m not trying to discount Yale for getting a near 4.0, but i knew that stuff just as well as she did and here i’m sitting with a 3.2 and she’s looking at something much higher.  yes, grades aren’t that important casey, don’t let them define you.  i’m not letting them define me but employers will. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>but then i really got to thinking (it is now almost 3 and i’m not looking at sleeping much tonight).  when i have existential crises like these there are two questions that i ask myself:  (1) if i won the lottery what would i be doing, (2) why did i originally decide to do what i’m now doing.  those have served me well for a long time in starting the internal conversation about where i am, where i’ve been, where i could go and why i should choose case number 17. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>if i won the lottery i would finish law school and then i would form a boutique law firm with really smart, sophisticated, well-travelled people to work with developing nations to establish growth plans that pulled them out of poverty while retaining sustainability of their people, economic resources and natural resources. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>originally i decided to come to law school because of a feeling of powerlessness to accomplish what i wanted to accomplish.  it all came together for me during two events:  (1) on the phone with my mother when she was telling me that for the third hurricane in a month she was going to be stuck working at the hospital for an undisclosed amount of time, (2) watching live 8 on tv in my basalt apartment.  i was thinking that pulling developing countries out of poverty is all well and good, but you know, teach a man to fish.  if we forgive their debt and link it to benchmarks which the country achieves or fails to achieve would kick in or fail to kick in more incentives, then we can actually affect true change in the world.  if we just forgive their debt it would be like handing ten million dollars to the last three guests on jerry springer. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there are a lot of other links in there.  i’m not going to actually connect the dots for you.  but the gist is that i entered law school because saint martin’s didn’t buy living with death and also that i was ready to go to work and i was ready to change some shit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so if the money is taken out of the equation, then really everything would still line up and i would still be in the right place to achieve what i’m looking to achieve and i also have made the correct decision to be here. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>yet, it is really hard to remember this when you have firms firms firms firms shoved down your throat constantly.  firm life may be fine for some: those that like to engage in settling.  but when was the last time any one of you remembered me settling.  sure it happens, but i fucking hate it when i’m forced into it.  the simple fact is that i do not have to settle for some firm in portland or even making a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in NY.  i mean, shit, do i even want to really litigate any of these environmental claims.  they are all piddly, and if i’m in the firm it will be a massive compromise of my value system to have to convince juries that my clients’ aren’t really THAT bad.  fuck that.  i mean don’t hold me to this statement, but FUCK THAT. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>if i don’t have to do it than why am i even thinking it.  i know why:  b/c the system is designed that way.  college, don’t know what you want to do but can write, why not law school, law school, don’t know what you want to do but performed fine on their exams, why not a firm in X city, X city, marriage, kids, house, mortgage, car payments.  fuck that. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>plus i’m really over the US in general.  i mean if i’m only interested in living in two cities in this fucking country but can list at least 40 that i would love to live in outside of this country why am i even thinking about staying other than stagnation.  stagnation isn’t a good enough reason for me, although i have no reason to decry it nor to laud it for others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>further, doing this would utilize what i’m good at:  advocacy, problem&lt;br>
solving, talking and communicating (instead of telling someone this is&lt;br>
how it has to be because the law says it is so), amorphous situations,&lt;br>
creating simplicity out of complexity.  much law school has been about&lt;br>
creating complexity out of simplicity.  this is another of my&lt;br>
justifications, but i don’t really create complexity out of simplicity&lt;br>
easily, i usually just think what is the point?  when you reverse it&lt;br>
and create simplicity out of complexity and simplify things and package&lt;br>
it for a specific audience, this is a skill i have in droves and few&lt;br>
other lawyers possess it.  needless, i just need to be in an&lt;br>
international forum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so all off the above reasoning has led me to this:  go abroad, refocus your efforts.  i have done some research tonight and in the past which has only served to show that it is a bright big world out there and i need to participate in it.  university of syndey has a one year LLM (masters of law, semi-PhD equivalent) and Masters of Environmental Science program that you can take in Germany.  England has numerous LLM’s in environmental law.  i could even take classes in Johannesburg i found out.  and afterwards?  well, we’ll figure it out.  perhaps i can find a group of persons who are interested in the same thing at one of these programs and we can figure it all out together.  perhaps there are boutiques out there that i just have to find that could hire me.  who knows. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>but the bottom line is that i cannot think that this semester’s grades are the end of the story.  as i told myself earlier, don’t put the final nail in my life’s coffin (nice metaphor, huh?) yet.  if i’m going to get out from entirely mediocre grades it will be by doing something dramatic, something big, something beyond the scale that these fuckers in their dockers and their dartmouth diplomas have never dreamed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>dream big.  i’ve always done it, i’ve always achieved it.  why stop now?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>for now i wanted to tell you about a fantastic new opportunity for your and your loved ones.  i’m not talking about the pyramid scheme that i’m deeply involved in, although i would love to talk to YOU about that sometime.  maybe we can get a drink, i don’t know you, but i know you’d like to hear what i have to say.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>summer lawns.  they are a band.  do it.  juff buckley lyrics and voice meets lyrical, well-instrumented music.  it is worth it.  start with the &lt;a href="http://www.kexp.org/podcasting/podcasting.asp#instudio">KEXP Live Podcast&lt;/a> especially the second (or third) song, &amp;ldquo;i’ll drive, you can sleep through the night.&amp;rdquo;  It begins at 9:20 or so on the podcast.  i lost my shit, it slowly ran down my leg as i was walking home from the bus station with my new headphones on, i turned it up to the loudest my iPod could go.  the sweat ran off as the sun, unimpeded by clouds beat my face.  too many driving nights, too many late night coffee’s, hot dogs, nachos, too many times pushing to meet a deadline of a lover awakening or a super bowl party or a father who is anxious to see me for the first time after a way.  driving is what i do.  you all know that.  it is one of the assorted reasons that makes me a sucka for a theme spun upon the basis of travelling in a car. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>just do it. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>so austin.  it is pretty sweet.  it would be nearly impossible to get a job here when my only link to the city is, &amp;ldquo;i like it,&amp;rdquo; since this town has the highest per capita lawyer rates of anywhere in america (or so i’ve been told).  plus it is too flipping hot for me anyway.  nevertheless i’m very glad that i have come down here for a few weeks.  i feel like i got a good taste of the city during my three weeks here so far, despite being quite busy. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it really is the fun, loose, hippy, chill town that you’ve heard about containing people who are passionate about issues, nice hills and rivers, great food, &amp;amp; unbelievable music venues.  i’ve done all of the above, including going to the Austin Air Guitar Championships, which neared the funniest things i’ve ever seen.  that competition was absolutely amazing.  there was this kid who did not look like steven tyler, did not act like steven tyler, did not dress like steven tyler.  the kid fucking WAS steven tyler.  it was so amazing, and he had been talked into competing by his friends after he was already in the door.  crazy.  these guys were hamming it up and i could barely drink a beer without snorting.  it defies definition, trust me, i tried to write a story about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that’s all for now.  yoga calls.&lt;/p>

was a bit of a transitional week as I finished up with the preclusion case and&lt;br>
settled into quite a monster of a case. The one thing that has struck me as I’ve been reading the briefs is how&lt;br>
(and this isn’t to blow smoke) similar all this legal writing is.  It&lt;br>
seems like things should be fundamentally different, that memos should be&lt;br>
different than briefs, which in turn should be different than opinions. But it seems from my infant amount of exposure&lt;br>
that they are all basically the same, except for the&lt;br>
objective/subjective/decisionary tone or flavor they have. The only one that seems to be different is&lt;br>
academic legal writing, and even that isn’t much different. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> Enough&lt;br>
of that. So my draft decision is on the&lt;br>
judge’s desk: written, proofread and cite-checked. Once the staff attorney gave me some feed&lt;br>
back and subsequently signed off on it then there wasn’t really anything else I&lt;br>
could do on it and we put in on his desk. It is supposed to circulate today or tomorrow depending on when he gets&lt;br>
a chance to give it a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> While&lt;br>
I’m waiting on the judge to give me feedback so I can make some modifications&lt;br>
to it they have me starting on a much more intricate and difficult case. Me being the Nuevo-Hippy that I am this&lt;br>
environmental case is right up my alley. Essentially what is happening is that a water conservation public&lt;br>
interest group is suing a city about 35 minutes from Austin and two developers&lt;br>
to stop their development which the interest group thinks is going to kill some&lt;br>
of the springs around here. There are a&lt;br>
couple of pieces more, but I’ll be working on this case for a while. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> What&lt;br>
I’d like to dissertate upon is what I think this is all about. See the major problem is that, although I’ve&lt;br>
read the briefs and started doing the case research, it seems the interest&lt;br>
group may not have standing to bring the suit to enjoin the development, which&lt;br>
is their goal. If the interest group&lt;br>
fails to satisfy standing than I what I’ve been wondering about is what is the&lt;br>
point of it all. This interest group is&lt;br>
apparently very-well funded and their attorney is very well written, their&lt;br>
position is very well supported and from what I can tell they seem very determined. With that in mind, I have been wondering why&lt;br>
did they bring the suit if the excellent attorney knew or at least suspected&lt;br>
(which I must attribute to him since he has lost other suits on standing&lt;br>
grounds) that he would loose “early” in the litigation without even getting to&lt;br>
the merits of their claim. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> It&lt;br>
seems to me that the group is incurring the expense of this litigation for one&lt;br>
of two reasons. Either they want the&lt;br>
city and the developers to pay since they won the political battle (see infra)&lt;br>
or this is a watch-out suit. I love&lt;br>
local politics, especially in a smaller, well-educated town. All of this reminds me so much of
Aspen&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where everyone is&lt;br>
overly educated and therefore has an opinion and the smallest things get bogged&lt;br>
down due to the overload of opinions as to how “this should get done.” &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here there had&lt;br>
been a major political battle fought and the interest group lost. What happened was the city was looking to&lt;br>
lock in these developments within their jurisdiction since they would then&lt;br>
receive the tax revenue. So the city and&lt;br>
the developers signed a contract wherein the developers would promise to build&lt;br>
and the city would promise the developers environmental regulations that remain&lt;br>
constant for fifteen years. The interest&lt;br>
group at that point raised their BS flag and said hold on a minute here, if we&lt;br>
lobby the city council and win stricter environmental regulations (the&lt;br>
subdivisions are both in environmentally sensitive areas that recharge one of&lt;br>
the main aquifers around central Texas) at some point in the future (which they&lt;br>
have and they have) then we’re not getting the benefit of our bargain since the&lt;br>
development contract forecloses our right to democratic process. Since the interest group was getting no where&lt;br>
with the city council they moved on to the state legislature, when they lost&lt;br>
there and the state passed a bill saying that cities could do this, then they&lt;br>
filed suit. So this case has a lot of&lt;br>
vindictive overtones to it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other thing&lt;br>
that could possibly be going on is that this could be watch-out&lt;br>
litigation. I think this is the more&lt;br>
probable scenario. Probably the interest&lt;br>
group is taking a hard line stance here in order to make development more&lt;br>
costly. If a developer was looking to&lt;br>
develop in this part of
Central Texas&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(which&lt;br>
apparently is booming) then the interest group has an interest in them not&lt;br>
developing in the environmentally sensitive areas. At a minimum the interest group’s litigation&lt;br>
would send a message to developers that developing in sensitive areas will be&lt;br>
more costly upfront than normal development, this cost-added should dampen some&lt;br>
of the development. Although certainly&lt;br>
raising the costs some would not preclude destructive development (which I&lt;br>
suspect is the interest group’s end goal). With regard to the city at least, the group may lose this battle, but it&lt;br>
seems they have won the war. The city&lt;br>
passed ordinances that are applicable to both its city limits and to its huge&lt;br>
extra-territorial jurisdiction in 2005 that truly do protect the environment in&lt;br>
the way that the interest group wanted to. I cannot claim to know that it was because of this litigation that the&lt;br>
city changed, but I suspect that to a certain extent it did. If nothing else the litigation raised public&lt;br>
awareness about what the development in environmentally sensitive areas was&lt;br>
doing to the water supply in this part of the state. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The point of this&lt;br>
is that one of the things that I suspected all along and that is not (and&lt;br>
cannot) be taught to first year law students is that litigation is merely one&lt;br>
tool. Entities have goals, well they should&lt;br>
have goals at least, and they have various tools at their disposal that enable&lt;br>
them to reach their goals: contracts, political process, litigation and other&lt;br>
agreements or dispute resolution systems. The pedagogy of law schools puts such an emphasis on the cases that do&lt;br>
make it pretty far down the litigation road that I think sometimes there is a&lt;br>
danger for law students to lose track of how few those cases are and to what&lt;br>
the other ways to achieve ones goals may be. In this case that I’m working on I really don’t think that they care as&lt;br>
much about this litigation as their two feet high record may attest, I think&lt;br>
they are looking beyond this one development to how they can truly restrict&lt;br>
future harmful development. They have&lt;br>
used this litigation to either raise public awareness or to raise costs to&lt;br>
developers or to raise the political stakes for the city enough that in the end&lt;br>
they got what they wanted, no matter what the outcome of this case may be. **&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>work: week 1</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-05-23-work-week-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2006/2006-05-23-work-week-1/</guid><description>&lt;p> I&lt;br>
am working on an interesting case. It is&lt;br>
ostensibly a property tax case, but that isn’t really the legal issue at stake&lt;br>
here. The easy rendition of the facts go&lt;br>
as such. 
Texas&lt;/p>
&lt;p>has an ad valoreum taxing system&lt;br>
wherein they tax property owner’s real and profit-producing-personal property&lt;br>
based upon the valuation of that property. In the spring of each year the central appraisal district for each&lt;br>
county notices all the taxpayers (persons and businesses) with what it think&lt;br>
the value of the property owner’s property is. The owners have an opportunity to protest before a quasi-judicial&lt;br>
appraisal review board (an administrative agency that is linked to the CAD) before&lt;br>
the ARB’s orders become final. In this&lt;br>
case the tax rolls (which are “sacred” in TX) were certified by the ARB without&lt;br>
protest by the taxpayers. Then TX was&lt;br>
looking to raise its income to provide financing to its schools, and so the&lt;br>
legislature passed a bill providing taxpayers amnesty. Normally if the CAD finds that you have more&lt;br>
property than they said you had you would be liable for back taxes (five years&lt;br>
back for real property that it didn’t know about and two years back for&lt;br>
personal property that it didn’t know about), but in order to get more&lt;br>
disclosures the legislature relaxed the back taxes if certain conditions were&lt;br>
met. In other words if you disclosed to&lt;br>
the CAD after the tax rolls were certified that you actually had more taxable&lt;br>
property than the CAD thought than you wouldn’t be liable for back taxes. Again, it was all under the guise of raising&lt;br>
financing for the school districts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> The&lt;br>
taxpayers in my case disclosed what they had and then the CAD renoticed their&lt;br>
appraised value, but they did it wrong. Since the CAD didn’t utilize the correct procedures the taxpayers&lt;br>
protested to the ARB. The ARB granted an&lt;br>
administrative hearing where the taxpayers argued both the lack of proper&lt;br>
notice as well as the fact that they didn’t even have property that had&lt;br>
originally been omitted and therefore their tax liability should not&lt;br>
increase. The ARB ruled only that the&lt;br>
tax liability would remain the same as was on the certified rolls. The CAD “thought” this meant they got a re-do&lt;br>
in order to correct their procedural errors, so they renoticed, again, the&lt;br>
taxpayers. The taxpayers protested,&lt;br>
again, and at the hearings the ARB this time ruled in favor of the CAD. The taxpayers appealed to district court who&lt;br>
ruled in their favor and now we have it on appeal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p> Ostensibly,&lt;br>
the legal issue is whether claim preclusion is applicable to an administrative&lt;br>
hearing. I think that this is an&lt;br>
interesting question. The policy reasons&lt;br>
generally proffered for claim preclusion in a normal, judicial setting are&lt;br>
economy (we want litigants to bring all of their claims in one case), fairness&lt;br>
(we should not give litigants an opportunity to correct their “lawyering”&lt;br>
mistakes until they finally get it right) and finality (at some point we have&lt;br>
to end this, it is the same argument that supports statute of limitations). While it seems that we generally have adopted&lt;br>
claim preclusion, we have placed certain limitations on the doctrine. For the doctrine to be applicable the second&lt;br>
case must have be a (1) final decision (2) rendered by a competent tribunal (3)&lt;br>
that was resolved on the merits. These&lt;br>
three limits make sense in that if an action is still pending and could end up&lt;br>
either way there should be no preclusion on another case. If the court that rendered judgment on the&lt;br>
case never had any business hearing the case in the first place it also makes&lt;br>
sense that subsequent litigation should not pay homage to that decision. The final one is the most intricate, but it&lt;br>
also makes sense in the abstract, subsequent litigation should not be precluded&lt;br>
by prior litigation that was never “actually litigated.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p> Although&lt;br>
these policies are not that difficult to apply to a judicial setting that has&lt;br>
the pomp, circumstance, rules and societally recognized authority that a court&lt;br>
system maintains, it is more difficult to translate those principles to an&lt;br>
administrative setting. I do see a&lt;br>
certain simple beauty in applying procedural postures from the judicial setting&lt;br>
into the administrative (or quasi-judicial setting). It certainly would make things simple for&lt;br>
those who are advocating for their side of a dispute to prevail. But is it too simple to merely transpose&lt;br>
rules of evidence or rules of form or rules of procedure or other legal rules&lt;br>
and principles into a “foreign” setting? Without anything more than a simple adoption by the “foreign” tribunal I&lt;br>
think that would be fairly foolhardy, but if the same policy issues and&lt;br>
concerns that are supporting the legal principle or rule in the judicial&lt;br>
setting carry over than I think that it does make sense to transpose them to an&lt;br>
administrative setting. So when looking&lt;br>
to see whether a rule or principle would be applicable in a quasi-judicial&lt;br>
administrative hearing I think that courts have two options: (1) what does the&lt;br>
organic statute say, and/or (2) what policy measures support the legal principle&lt;br>
in its organic domain (usually the judicial realm) and whether those would also&lt;br>
support the adoption in the administrative setting. It does seem that the policies supporting&lt;br>
preclusion in the judicial setting would easily be adaptable to the administrative&lt;br>
setting. It does not seem to me that&lt;br>
economy, fairness and finality would NOT be transferable to the administrative&lt;br>
setting. &lt;/p>
&lt;p> That&lt;br>
paragraph is, basically, surplusage since
Texas&lt;/p>
&lt;p>case law has long held that the&lt;br>
principles of both claim and issue preclusion may be applied to administrative&lt;br>
settings under the same three limitations. In the judicial setting where subsequent litigants argue claim&lt;br>
preclusion I suspect that much of the analysis will turn on whether the&lt;br>
decision was on the merits. In the&lt;br>
administrative setting I suspect that much of the analysis in a case of first&lt;br>
impression will have to turn on the competent tribunal setting. This is an important analysis point and an&lt;br>
important limitation on the doctrine when applied to administrative&lt;br>
bodies. I do not suspect that society is&lt;br>
interested in recognizing the authority of a governmental body when that body&lt;br>
does not have the proper statutory or societal authority; or operates under&lt;br>
such a loose set of principles and rules that its decisions are fully&lt;br>
arbitrary; or does not allow grievances to be actually heard but merely makes&lt;br>
the decision that appears the best without giving due process to those who are&lt;br>
protesting. Yet if an administrative&lt;br>
body does operate under a certain grant of authority and does offer due process&lt;br>
and does operate under some guise of rules that lend authority to its rulings&lt;br>
then it makes sense that we should “listen to it.” &lt;/p>
&lt;p> The&lt;br>
other hard analysis is whether the decision of the administrative agency is&lt;br>
final. Obviously subsequent litigation&lt;br>
should not be precluded if the quasi-judicial body was only tabling the matter&lt;br>
until the agency fixed something. Conversely subsequent litigation should be precluded if the quasi-judicial&lt;br>
body was rendering an actual, binding ruling. This analysis, though facially simple, may not always be so easy in the&lt;br>
real world. I am fascinated by municipal&lt;br>
politics and have been known to watch Channel 3 while in
Nashville&lt;/p>
&lt;p>. I have seen the looseness under which some of these Boards operate&lt;br>
under. I have read the entire protest&lt;br>
hearing transcript in this case which only confirms my suspicion that these&lt;br>
hearings are not formal trials (and they should not be). The problem is for this case that at the&lt;br>
first hearings the board merely retained the tax liability as it was prior to&lt;br>
the first renoticing. But did that mean&lt;br>
that they were tabling the matter so the agency could fix the procedural&lt;br>
problems or did it mean that they were ruling on the merits. Although there is some bleed over into the&lt;br>
other element, the crux of the matter is here. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>first you create yourself.  just like any other document (real or fake, static or dynamic) you choose which aspects of yourself to accentuate and whatever. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>after you have created yourself then you find friends.  many times one of your friends will have beaten you to the site and will already have created themself on the site.  sometimes you will be the first of your close friends.  whatever.  so then you ask them to be your little online friend.  and then they accept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>once you have friends then you start to leave little funny messages on each other’s &amp;ldquo;walls&amp;rdquo; (bulletin boards, etc.).  mostly they are responsive so if someone is looking at your page they will only get half the story and thus be confused.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>you can then really mess the process up.  you can start to blog on these sites.  you can add pictures to the sites.  you can tag said pictures with your friends names so the pictures show up on their sites.  you can tell your entire community of friends about parties or plans.  you can take it to the next level by getting third-party add on templates which will fuck with the page’s CSS code to make it highly annoying to people like me.  you can add songs. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it is fucking crazy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BUT, the craziness of it is not what i want to talk about on this not sunny, not cloudy, not cold, not warm, not spring, not summer saturday afternoon.  what i really want to talk about is how people choose to portray themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>first you can read an article from a blogger who i’ve been reading for a few years.  she put it better than i can.  but i would like to update and respond to some of what she has said.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i have noticed some trends.  people tend to choose one way to portray themselves:  ironic, straightup, post-ironic, fun, withheld, intellectual, whatever the case may be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i guess that is it.  and i cannot find the article.  so this sux.  sorry for wasting your time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>in order to explain it properly a little backstory is in order.  i case i haven’t laid it out for you, i have two basic roads diverged&lt;br>
inside my yellow self.  the first is to &amp;ldquo;go to work&amp;rdquo; and just sell to&lt;br>
the litigation man and move to NY, live fast, live hard, learn to&lt;br>
litigate like a champ.  the other road is to &amp;ldquo;have a good life&amp;rdquo; and go&lt;br>
to a medium market and not work so hard, or be so good, but also have a&lt;br>
life outside of my 2 AM chinese feasts, my blackberry and my $5000&lt;br>
suits.  the only markets that i’m really considering are: portland,&lt;br>
austin and denver.  in that order.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ok.  i just accepted my second job for the summer.  this one with a state appeals court in texas.  this is good for a number of reasons.  first of all it will be in austin.  austin is one of my cities.  that is good.  this will be a great recommendation and will (i think) virtually ensure that i can get an interview there for a 2L job.  in fact, i will probably interview with firms while i’m there to get it out of the way.  also i would want to interview there as the firms that are there are outposts of big law firms headquartered in houston or dallas.  the attorneys that those firms will send to on-campus interview season next fall will be from the larger offices in the bigger cities.  that means that they may not have a clue about life in the austin office.  they may, but more likely they will tell me that they know and they won’t really know.  so it will be advantageous to go check it out.  in addition to the austin connection and the judge being a great reference to lawyers in that city, judge law (yes that’s his name) will be a good reference in general.  state appeals courts, although not as prestigious as state supreme courts, may give me more exposure b/c of their higher work load.  plus i’ll be in the same building as the state supreme court so i can talk to those people.  since it is of lesser prestige that means i’ll be doing more of the work.  the administrative assistant has already told me that i will be researching and writing opinions.  me, the freak 1L, will be writing opinions that could be in textbooks some day.  pretty kool huh?  on a state supreme court level i won’t be doing the writing, only the reasearch.  then there is the layer of the federal court system.  1L’s DON’T GET JOBS at the federal appeals court level.  it doesn’t happen unless you are #1 at harvard and have 5 degrees prior to being a JD candidate.  so that leaves the federal trial court level, now that would be interesting.  the difference between trial courts and appeals courts is that appeals courts are clean.  i don’t have any problem getting my fingers dirty, however at the appeals level you get to focus on what the law is.  much of the emotion is taken out of it.  much of the gamesmanship is taken out of it.  much of the uncertainty of juries is taken out of it.  that leaves time and space for the law to really come full force and be analyzed in detail.  so all in all i think that i will be the best experience possible for me.  and i’m not just trying to justify not getting an offer from the TN or TX supreme courts.  i did have offers from the fed trial level, but i don’t think that the prestige of federal over state courts outweighs the prestige and possibilities for learning of appeals over trial courts.  so it will be a good reference, it will be prestigious, &amp;amp; it will be a great learning experience.  enough said.  wait there is more.  it is in AUSTIN.  which should be GREAT over the summer, bands, booze, etc.  now i just have to convince cam to come with me!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the other half will be in aspen at the policy and litigation firm out there.  i am excited about that one too as i will see life from the other side.  we’re to work on a national security policy position paper.  we’re to work on some big-time environmental litigation and some other litigation as well.  it will be a rounded experience. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>then there is faith’s non-profit which i think that i’m going to start working with her on.  at least i can do the IRS filing for her non-profit status.  that isn’t a small deal either.  i can also do some liasoning with the young lawyers committee of the miami bar association and to help her develop her curiculum for these kids.  so i will also be working on that over the summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then there is the book that is starting to coallesce inside my head and that must be written this summer, at least in a solid draft form.  it will be good and it will get done.  i cannot wait.  this summer is going to be what i want out of it.  varied, interesting, polarizing, emasculatizing, and generally all-tizing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the main reason that leads me to say this is my utter inability to cross platform communicate.  i have reached this level that many my age haven’t.  i mean, hell, i do blog.  that comes from always being a tech-head, an occupational hazard from being born to a dude who was poking around with magnetic screwdrivers inside of IBM PC’s, XT’s and the sleek yet subdued AT’s at that strip mall computer joint circa 84 when the auto parts store fired him, or he left.  not sure i was small.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>yeah, so cross platform communication.  i have think i am an utter master at the independent forms of communication.  i can text while holding an apple in my mouth, changing my ipod music and driving with my knee over snowy vail pass.  i can blog.  i can talk on my cell phone.  i can talk to people.  i can email.  i can post messages on the wall’s of my friend’s facebook.com pages. i can see who was looking at my pages on friendster or my space.  i can virtual stalk my friends and laugh at their IM away messages and can even induce a few chuckles myself.  i can IM harrassing messages to my &amp;ldquo;colleagues&amp;rdquo; when they are called on in class and for some reason the IT people haven’t blocked the internet that particular class (of course this only happens when i remember to bring my wireless PCMCIA card, b/c i’m not advanced tech-boy and do not have this snazzy internal wireless thing….no wires….fucking genius.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>what i cannot really well is to transfer across these platforms.  for some reason i feel like communications which happened in one forum should stay in that forum only.  i have always known this, but it was driven home to me today when someone came up to me and said, &amp;ldquo;i just added you as a friend on facebook.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;i know.&amp;rdquo;  i said with my crunched eyebrows face.  i’m not sure if i was confused as to whether he genuinely thought he was informing me.  was i confused b/c i’m not really his friend and we never talk and suddenly his clicking on my profile and the &amp;ldquo;add friend&amp;rdquo; button is the lubrication to get the ole’ engine of friendship and get to know ya started up again.  was i confused b/c i just don’t like to communicate out of context.  i’m not sure why i gave him that look, but i certainly did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>oh well, it started a nice little chat with my new friend.  i know he is my friend to because i have a fucking web page with my name in bold and big font and he is listed under my friends.  maybe it is all growing on me.  maybe i just like to know who my friends are.  where do i title my BFF?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>team korea (my team) didn’t champion the effort to the extent that their girlfriends did.  i was really pissed about it for a while.  much of that came from the inherrent pressure that is always present, pushing upon my insides from my outsides.  but once i got past this i really started to unpack the dissappointment i realized that much of my dissappointment was because when i didn’t know the procedural possibilities i felt handcuffed. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>see, we knew the arguments to make, i did fine in torts.  but i didn’t know how to make them.  i cannot just pick up a manual and learn something.  i need to be empowered by seeing something happen in front of me. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>so i have decided to run to run the thing next year. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the major thing that i want to change is to push the preliminaries back a week.  it was pretty harsh to have it the first weekend when we got back, a weekend we all wanted to enjoy.  but during that first weekend back i would put on a seminar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the optional seminar will empower people like me to really dig deep.  by giving them the tools that they didn’t have before it will allow them to make some really good arguments. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i’m planning to run the seminar the way i’ve learned to teach people.  edip style.  explain, demonstrate, immitate, practice.  start with some classes on (how to question, speculation, hearsay, entering evidence, decorum essentials, opens/closes, tactical/strategy basics), followed by part of trial that we would demonstrate for them.  then i’d break the students into small groups and let the 1l’s coach them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this will empower people like me that know the arguments to make but get a little handicapped because they don’t know how to make it.  it will also level the playing field.  many of the people who advanced (reference yale) had parents that were lawyers or had mock trial experience.  that i’m not as much worried about.  the main thing that i thought was disparate was the level of coaching that some people recieved after the first trial and were so much better during the second one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if you can move the coaching up front i think that people will get much more out of it.  i have a lot yet to work on this.  more to come.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>only thing is that this week has been vicious.  luckily i when i was called on i was prepared the the guy she called on before me is an idiot so i turned out looking stellar and she didn’t really press me too hard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in other news, i’ve been thinking a lot about how we all throttle our lives.  many of my friends, the younger ones anyway, don’t really know what is going on with this.  all they have ever known is school where you’re always on, always moving, always going going going.  but it has been a long time for me personally since i was in such an environment (obviously before last august).  i’m not sure how i feel about it.  for one thing it definitely makes the time go by quickly.  this is a post for another chapter, but i thing that my fear of losing out on things lines up here well to create my abject hatred of routines, cause you don’t see things in the same way.  but back to the point, the quickly thing is helpful when you’re not engaged in the most desirous of experiences.  i guess there is something to be said.  maybe not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>mock trial competition preliminaries are this weekend.  grades come out on tuesday.  we’ll just see!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>see i started riding, really riding my snowboard when i got out of the marine corps, when i was 27.  that is old for a rider.  yes, people my age were pretty much the vangaurd of snowboarders, at least on the popular (as opposed to psycho subculture of a few weirdos) level.  yes, i did snowboard when i was in high school and college, albeit awefully (ask joe).  but i really got into the sport when i was already too old to fit in.  when i was in mammoth i was surrounded by riders, there everyone rode.  there everyone was 18 and smoked pot instead of coffee and instead of a nightcap.  so i was the old man.  but it was kool, no one really looked at me too sideways, except for the fact that i was wearing &amp;ldquo;mountaineering&amp;rdquo; clothes probably more suited to a skier than a rider.  but that didn’t seem to phase people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the next winter i came here (where i am now).  i came to aspen.  it was a good transition, it was what i needed.  as i’ve written at length and told most people i know, this is my heaven, my paradise.  but here people my age do not ride.  they ski.  in fact the only people that ride here are the 15 to 20 crowd.  even the snowboard instructors are all younger than me, and the ones that are my age all tell me that on their days off they prefer to ski.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but me, obstinate as always, continued last season to ride.  i don’t really regret it.  i did improve to the point where nothing really scares me and i can pretty much get through anything on an area mountain.  backcountry stuff maybe maybe not.  but for the most part i can hold my own. today, however, i was thinking about all of this.  why don’t i ski?  there really is no reason that i can think of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it is so much more elegant.  and not that i’m elegant in the slightest, i am the founding member of the alley cat climbing club, but i just seems more me to me.  you don’t have to fuck with strapping yourself in.  you don’t have to bother when you get to bump sections to change your style.  you can get away with wearing what i wear without being an oddity.  nonetheless i have kept riding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>sometimes i wonder if my window has passed.  now i’m a vacationer, i am one of those who i looked down upon while i lived in paradise.  i do not have an entire 100 days of skiing to perfect a new sport, so i am forced to make choices, to compromise.  so tomorrow i ski for the second day.  we’ll see how it goes.  i do like to ride, but i think that i’m bored with it a bit and looking for something new.  riding is fun on powder days, but other than that i think i have it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>onward as always.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>what if i hadn’t left?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>that is the crux of the matter.  i’m back in aspen.  it is winter (obviously) the snow is immaculate, forgiving, soft, just grabby enough, not skiied out.  the people here are the same.  it is weird how many i feel like i know.  when i arrived i walked down the mall at snowmass, weighted by my board for the first time in months.  as i walked i was self-conscious.  i felt like a sell-out.  but nevertheless there i was, walking down the mall with my snowboard.  as i walked i relaxed and started looking at the faces in the crowd.  there were many that i recognized.  a surprising amount.  i started saying hi to a few people.  then more and more that i knew and before i knew it i was satisfied and happy.  dropped my board off and settled in for a long winter’s ride.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the coffee shop is closing and so am i.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>am in Tennessee for the holidays.  It is what it always seems to be, text off family love, subtext of family angst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See this will be the last Xmas in this house.  My aunt has returned for the first time in a while.  I have returned for the first time in a while.  In fact this is the most complete Christmas my grandmother has had in at least three years if not longer. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how does that make me feel?  Hell, that is why all of you pay the subscription fees for this site isn’t it….to hear my ramblings on feelings.  Not sure.  I tend to deal with angst as if it doesn’t exist, to just table something.  I don’t deal with it before I have to, and I barely deal with it when I am forced to.  Ignorance is bliss or something completely as idiotically moronic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am on drugs right now b/c I am sick….of life.  I’m the cough-master and the sneeze-machine and my chest-heaves and my head-aches, but I’ll get through.  Hell I have to since I’m leaving Tuesday for Aspen to ski.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will be odd returning there, I think.  But we’ll have to see about that then.  More soon.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>my brother has been applying to grad schools and he and i have been bantering regarding his personal statement.  he recently told me that he has lost his mojo and he doesn’t seem to have any motivation to really put his heart into the document.  i replied:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>shouldn’t fear of becoming what your stereotypes&lt;br>
dictate you should become enough?  has always been for me.  do you&lt;br>
want THIS to continue?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to which he replied: &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don’t really get your drift…&lt;br>
Do I want WHAT to continue?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>to which i replied:  EXACTLY&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but then i wrote the following.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>was thinking the last few days about what my gist really was in that&lt;br>
last email.  i guess that the gist of it was fairly simply readable, but&lt;br>
there are a lot of consequences that have opened up in my mind regarding&lt;br>
such a premise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>my argument that change is predicated upon some dissatisfaction with the&lt;br>
currency of something is relatively banal and easy to understand. &lt;br>
personal lives, like nature, tend to embrace some semblance of an&lt;br>
inertial existence.  when there is change there is massive change when&lt;br>
there is stagnation there is massive stagnation.  you do not have to&lt;br>
look further than [insert reality tv show here] to figure that one out. &lt;br>
but life, like nature require some sort of energy to take you between&lt;br>
inertial energy states  [action to rest or vice the versa].  thus we&lt;br>
enter the proof of my original theorem whereas dissatisfaction is the&lt;br>
catalyst for change.  not always would it be the only catalyst [just as&lt;br>
there is potential energy and kinetic energy] but generally i would&lt;br>
argue it is the most prevalent catalyst.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>well that is all fine and good and was the beginning and end of my posit&lt;br>
to you.  if you want to change [read: improve] then you have to focus&lt;br>
your dissatisfaction on the current state of your life which you want to&lt;br>
change [improve].  i find that if i do not focus this negative&lt;br>
motivation upon something tangible [or at least graspable] then i will&lt;br>
coherently know that i have to change something [presently i know that i&lt;br>
have to quit smoking] but i won’t do anything about it [as i'm not&lt;br>
focusing upon the fact that i'll die a horribly painful death as&lt;br>
carcinogens violently devour my insides].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but the real crux of this emails length comes when i take the next&lt;br>
step.  what happens when i say OK, change is created my dissatisfaction&lt;br>
[or pick your own synonym], i can buy that.  so why am i always&lt;br>
changing?  changing jobs, desires, locales, images, personalities,&lt;br>
auras, partners, i’m always changing something.  is it that i’m&lt;br>
dissatisfied with stagnation so my hatred of the stagnant creates a need&lt;br>
for perpetual motion [continuing the metaphor] and thus i feel that i&lt;br>
always  have to change something.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>or is it deeper?  do i have an insatiable appetite to devour everything&lt;br>
i can?  am i not a locus descending upon the egyptians but THE locus&lt;br>
descending upon the egyptians?  once i finish with one project i have to&lt;br>
move on to the next.  whether that is establishing that i really am&lt;br>
smart as i think i am [cum laude from the #1 civil engineering program&lt;br>
in the world with full knowledge i could have done even better] and then&lt;br>
moving on to the next project of establishing my manliness [off to war&lt;br>
leading 228 Marines and responsible for their lives and safety;&lt;br>
unabashedly running into the teeth of enemy fire b/c that is what men&lt;br>
do] and then moving on to the project of establishing my koolness&lt;br>
[ski-bumming].  on and on in this and other facets of my life besides&lt;br>
the professional.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>fine i do that but why?  is it that i find something i want, i achieve&lt;br>
it and find that it isn’t really what i want?  or are these merely steps&lt;br>
along a process to becoming something larger than is definable with a&lt;br>
few words or mere labels?  this is my personal, present, hypothesis.  i&lt;br>
think that i dislike labels so much that i’m willing to change and put&lt;br>
my body and mind through the stress of constant change merely so i&lt;br>
cannot be labeled as this or that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>is that legitimate?  is that stupid?  i don’t know but i think that that&lt;br>
is nevertheless me.  i think that i view life as an iterative process as&lt;br>
opposed to a destination with the white picket fence blah blah.  but&lt;br>
there is a grave danger i think with the way that i’ve come to look at&lt;br>
the world.  i guess the danger as i see it is ending up alone b/c i’m&lt;br>
either too picky or too mobile or too ADHD to stay with someone for very&lt;br>
long.  the danger is further with my lack of wanting to lay down any&lt;br>
roots [the fact that the bar is a massive exam and if i ever move to a&lt;br>
new state i have to retake it and thus i am impetized to stay in one&lt;br>
state scares the living shit out of me] will not let me have any real&lt;br>
true connections outside of my friends who are spread across the country&lt;br>
and who love me and will email and talk on the phone with me and all&lt;br>
that but i only get to experience very little of life with.  we can go&lt;br>
further down this road of my fears but the point is this, will these&lt;br>
fears/dissatisfactions be enough to make me change my changing ways?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>tonight i watched a rockumentary called the last waltz.  it made me crave my former life more than i normally do.  shit.  whatever, tomorrow i return to the land of dockers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the best part of the weekend, however, was when a friend of mine turned to me at happy hour and laid the best compliment i’ve received in years on me.  &amp;ldquo;you know man from now on i’m going to call you: THE DUDE.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;pour me another caucasian gary.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>it wasn’t.  however it did remind me of EVERYTHING i loved and hated about that place at the same time.  they were intertwined like those two icky snakes in the hypocritic oath thingy.  i’m glad we get scales instead of snakes.  HURRAY FOR LAW. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i other news this has been a fairly slow week and i took time out to golf today with e.  now this must have been the first time i’ve golfed in…..oh….i don’t know…..five years.  give or take a couple of days.  nevertheless it has been a long time.  (intended to put something creative in there but the wording just couldn’t work smoothly.)  i’m conflicted on golf.  on the one hand you have to get outside any way you can, and at least you are walking around some grassy knoll.  but on the other hand it has such middle class, no life having, dockers wearing, wife apathetic-y, horrible connotations.  and such hauty tauty i’m too good for you so i keep you outside the gates to my countryclub, you swine connotations.  i don’t know.  but i did it.  and some balls flew and some balls dribbled. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this weekend i hope to get away for a little walk in the woods.  have driven something like 100 miles in the past 4 weeks since school has started.  am i still me?  need to get away from this fucking city.  need to drive, need to wall, need to see trees and waterfalls and rocks and birds and maybe some babboon ass.  do they sell that in mass quantities?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>well, i’ve gotten through another post successfully and by success i’m measuring it in terms of a complete lack of lawyering terms and references.  will i ever stop analyzing myself and everything around me on at least two levels?  shit man just live your life.  really all is well, am in a good mood tonight.  we’ll see if i still have a back when i wake up tomorrow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Rule #3 is Work Smarter not Harder.  In that vein I give you a reply to another email.  A friend asked me what I thought about the distinct age difference between myself and those I now find myself surrounded by.  I give you that question below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And now in celebration of my 29th Birthday:  A Treatise on Age&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am conflicted in my thoughts on the age issue.  Considering the&lt;br>
backdrop of life in general and this especially being a competition (no&lt;br>
matter how many times the professors try to mantra into me that vandy&lt;br>
is a &amp;ldquo;collegial atmosphere,&amp;rdquo; its still a fucking competition…..) I&lt;br>
think that it is mostly to my &amp;ldquo;advantage,&amp;rdquo; although there are a few&lt;br>
&amp;ldquo;disadvantages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My view of much of my class is fairly close to what I expected:  greek,&lt;br>
business or poli sci majors, straight from college, clicky, etc.  In&lt;br>
the two weeks we’ve been together now I have watched the stratification&lt;br>
of this formerly nebulous mixture o people into their respective&lt;br>
pieces, or more appropriately how they have viewed themselves&lt;br>
throughout their undergraduate experience.  This is a carryover for&lt;br>
these people, a mere continuation.  I can tell it by the way they talk&lt;br>
about drinking by the away messages they leave on their AIM accounts by&lt;br>
the ease which they flow around the building with their computer bags&lt;br>
yanking at their trapezious muscles. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few exceptions to the rules, those that are not greek,&lt;br>
those with interesting majore, those that took the vaunted one year&lt;br>
off, but by and large these exceptions are only in one category and&lt;br>
those that exhibit these exceptions fall into line on the other&lt;br>
categories. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few others.  I know of two with masters (one that has his&lt;br>
MFA in creative writing and with whom I have had many chats), and one&lt;br>
other guy who is older than me.  He is married with a couple of kids,&lt;br>
etc. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there is me.  I’m not yet sure how I fit into the social spectrum,&lt;br>
cream or juice?  I, frankly, do not care.  I’m equally nice and equally&lt;br>
ass-holic to most people which stems from the fact that I feel that I&lt;br>
have much less vested in the social aspect of this school scenario.&lt;br>
I’ve been in the real world, I know what it is like to spend entire&lt;br>
months only talking to one or two people, none of that ever bothered&lt;br>
me.  But many of these people do not know that freedom and so they tie&lt;br>
much of their identity up in the social dynamics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This vestiture creates some interesting things.  Firstly, I think it&lt;br>
creates in many a fear of &amp;ldquo;being called on&amp;rdquo; by the professors.  In the&lt;br>
socratic method professors will pick out a student and then stick with&lt;br>
them for a while asking question after question, hopefully breaking off&lt;br>
the outside skin of the onion and distilling the truth out of the&lt;br>
specificity of the case…..specificity to generality is the law school&lt;br>
mantra (mixing of metaphors was on purpose).  But this method is&lt;br>
generally frightening to many people b/c their brainpower will be laid&lt;br>
out there for all their social comrades to see if they’re an idiot or&lt;br>
surprisingly mentally adroit.  Secondly, I think it creates a dynamic&lt;br>
similar to high school.  We are around the same people, in the same&lt;br>
building, all the time.  What I mean by the high school simile (which&lt;br>
is far from unique) is merely the constancy of display.  You can’t blow&lt;br>
up at someone without the rest of the class finding out about it&lt;br>
quickly and then they will all look at you, look at you in class, look&lt;br>
at you in the halls on the way to the lockers, look at you in the cafe&lt;br>
during lunch, look at you in the library after class when much of our&lt;br>
compatriots are in the same large room with big tables that always&lt;br>
makes me think that I’m in the study hall from Dead Poet’s Society and&lt;br>
that cranky teacher is going to come in at any moment and make me turn&lt;br>
off my iPod and study harder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the rest of them are very vested.  I’m not.  I don’t give a flying&lt;br>
rat fuck about any of that stuff.  I’m here to spend $60k a year to&lt;br>
learn stuff, and I’ll learn it well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The life experience aspect of it all is the other advantage that I&lt;br>
hold, the only one that really matters (I think) besides the &amp;ldquo;not&lt;br>
caring about what people think of me&amp;rdquo; advantage.  In classes where you&lt;br>
are nearly required to have a perspective on the world and you can only&lt;br>
conceptually create one it builds an idealist when a realist would do.&lt;br>
These are all advantages and I won’t belabor the point, even though it&lt;br>
is a valid one.  I understand business in a way they don’t.  I&lt;br>
understand politics in a way they don’t.  I understand foreign&lt;br>
relations, and constitutional powers and the mind of evil people in a&lt;br>
way they don’t.  But none of that matters now.  Right now we’ve all&lt;br>
been thrown blindfolded, tied up, and dowsed in K-Y into the pool and&lt;br>
are merely trying to get our bearings without the lube making our eyes&lt;br>
sting.  We’ll just have to see how this all pans out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main disadvantage is the being used to the school deal and the&lt;br>
knowing how to study deals…..&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Happy Birthday to me.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I DID decide to come to law school for an assundry of reasons.  I don’t&lt;br>
ever see myself becoming one of &amp;ldquo;those&amp;rdquo; lawyers to whom you refer.&lt;br>
That has never been my style, I like to save my fights for something I&lt;br>
care about, not things that don’t really matter.  One of the very few&lt;br>
things that I think that I’ve learned in life is the difference&lt;br>
therein, what matters and what doesn’t matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But back to my reasons.  They are many, but they basically came down to&lt;br>
a failure to finalize the next deal and give myself some assurances&lt;br>
that the writing career was going to launch for real.  When I found&lt;br>
that out then it was still not an easy choice.  For a long time I&lt;br>
thought that coming here and doing this was a complete compromise of a&lt;br>
value system that I had steadily developed over my two year repose in&lt;br>
bum land.  Arguably creating a value system while you are bumming is&lt;br>
not really a sane thing to do b/c it would inherently serve merely to&lt;br>
propagate that lifestyle.  That conceded, I think I constructed it&lt;br>
fairly lucidly.  And I believed in it, but I came here&lt;br>
notwithstanding. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have realized over the course of the last two weeks that I am not&lt;br>
violating that value system by being here.  I am probably still within&lt;br>
that bounds of that value system.  I had been so focused on law&lt;br>
school=debt=need for financial assurances=selling out to the firm&lt;br>
lifestyle=doing stuff that I don’t want to do and living in a place I&lt;br>
don’t want to live.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My epiphany has come in regards to the end of the chain of logic.  It&lt;br>
doesn’t necessarily follow that I will have to do stuff that I don’t&lt;br>
want to do, in fact if I play my cards correctly there are a lot of&lt;br>
really tool things that you can do.  And plus, NYC isn’t Aspen but I’ve&lt;br>
always wanted to live there just like I have always wanted to live on&lt;br>
vacation.  So in fact they are the same thing (the environments) they&lt;br>
just embrace different aspects of my complicated desire spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Whatever.  The point is that I really felt like a fucking failure when&lt;br>
I came here, like a sellout, but now I’m realizing that I’m certainly&lt;br>
not a failure and as long as I don’t sellout I’m not a sellout. &lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So for whatever it is worth there it is.  I have some blogging to do this weekend.  There are some things and thoughts to share, we’ll get around to this thing Yet.  Don’t fret.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>when did i become so unsure of myself?  i have always had direction, drive, determination, focus, goals and all that zig zigler shit.  and now?  now i cannot even understand what the fuck i’m doing spending $150k on an education that i only want to marginally (at best) use.  i like it, don’t get me wrong.  it is challenging and collegial and academic and all that crap, but is it correct.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>for the first time in over 10 days i actually had some time.  whether i’ve been moving or settling or entering into new social interactions (meeting new people, yaddy yadda) or figuring out the class load or remembering how to study, or whatever.  i’ve been fucking rush rush rush for the past while.  that more so than the fact that i’m here is what is really compromising the value system that i had established for myself over two years of claiming to be an artist.  but what was really lacking was time.  time to think, time to analyze, time to examine, time to be.  i haven’t looked deeply at anything other than what the fuck this dude means when he says &amp;ldquo;stare decisis is crap and i say that stare principiis should reign supreme&amp;rdquo; for whatever that is worth. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>today i finished my work up while at school and came home and worked out and then had some time before eric and i were to run to dinner and i just sat on the couch (laid) and thought and listened to some music and just was.  i had a moment of reconciliation where i realized that this is just like anything else.  it isn’t different, it may be new, but it is the fucking same.  i need to treat it the same.  i need to stop looking at the face value of my experience and remember what i have learned over the course of these past years since i returned from combat.  i have to analyze what the fuck is important in the manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>today i realized that i was thinking exactly what the teacher was wanting me to think.  like a fish hooked on the lip being drug to the left and then to the right.  i could fight, but i was still at her mercy.  but it is the one class, the one and only true intellectual endeavor which i will experience this year.  i cannot let myself do that.  i have to think either faster or slower than she wants be to think.  i have to go anti-ocsillitory she keeps us running back and forth back and forth and i need that to end for me.  i need to rage against the machine, at least in that class. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i expressed these sentiments to a few people in between that class and another and they looked at me like i was courtney love exiting church in a long ann taylor dress.  nevertheless that is how it has to be.  i have to think more, act less, be more efficient.  but more than all of that i just have to be who i am, and not who any of these professors want me to become.  &amp;ldquo;we’re here to teach you to think like a lawyer&amp;rdquo; is OK except for when i don’t want to think like a lawyer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>it fucked my whole dope up and only ended up staying at the bar for a little while b/c i couldn’t concentrate on anything people were saying and couldn’t respond in anything approaching wit.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>it is hot.  i’m a sweaty behemoth when i’m not in starbucks finding out that a party to go to is too far to walk and i’m gonna register about a .23 on smoky’s breathalizers he got mail order (his first purchase from eBay).  and i haven’t had a single drink.  am just drunk tired.  but the place looks good.  it is coming along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>lots of errands tomorrow.  then  plan on spending monday/tuesday just on my computer finishing everything up.  comcast will grace me with their presence on monday, so cam can stop being mad at me for patronizing his nemisous.

&lt;p>what i can be certain of is that i spent a good amount of time on said contraption this evening.  once i made the psychological and philosophical leap into the pool of law school, i made another leap.  i’m gonna be a rock star.  shit, i already have the hair for it, and fucking mick jagger and dylan cannot sing, so why should i be required to have that apptitude or ability?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in that vein i decided that it was time to begin establishing my base of groupies.  well, how do you do that when registration/orientation is six days away?  you get on the secured forums and whore yourself out.  then you find out that all the kids are about aim, not any of the other messenger services, so you pick up that ole’ axe, dust it off, plug it into the foot pedal and then into the amp and you strum a couple of notes.  gingerly, tentatively, just testing out the ole’ axe to see what sound she may be capable of.  then you get a little more confident and so you play a little tune, and before you know it you are completely rocking out until your mom knocks on the door, but since you’re rocking out so hard you don’t hear her and then she opens the door to ask if you wanna wanna fanta fanta and she is on one of those fucking jet ski’s jetting through a faux-water-like surface with a fake wake and you don’t know how to reply so you just stare at her and let your axe hang around your neck, but the ole’ axe didn’t have a shoulder strap when you picked up that ole’ thing so when you let it hang, it doesn’t hang as much as fall to the ground and makes a huge, horrible cord-esque/reverb-esque sound that is lovely to you, but horrible to mom and when it dies down you look at her and say, &amp;ldquo;see what you did?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>yeah nothing like that happened to me, nothing even remotely close to that happened to me, nothing even in the spirit of that metaphor happened to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i did however &amp;ldquo;meet&amp;rdquo; some people.  virtually, that means over the internet for the older listeners among you, &amp;ldquo;meet&amp;rdquo;-ed some people.  threw out a few funny emails, a bit of IM-ing banter, some networking (apparently friendster is D_E_A_D dead, in case you cared, the new friendster is facebook) sites where you put up your shit and they can all track you down….or something.  so my shite is out there and we’ll see how much of a rock star i can become.  needless to say, i’m getting it on virtual style. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>whatever happened to anticipation?  to getting to know people after you meet them on the big &amp;ldquo;first day of school&amp;rdquo; and then wondering which group you have the chance to fit in?  and if it is a conglomeration then maybe you should start your own group?  very uncomfortable….very exciting.  i guess i’ll only taste that.  but for now i’m happy being an internet rock star&lt;/p>

&lt;p>signed the lease in nashville today.  locked on the moving van for wednesday through friday.  dad has his plane tix to help in the move.  am depressed as shit and sick of hoping for it to end. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>guess if i just embrace it and then cope with the feelings that that will be better than trying to forestall the inevitable. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>for some reason this place seems to me to be like the apartment dave, natasha and i rented behind the library in champaign.  cannot figure out why, other than it is old.  maybe the presence of ghosts was what did it.  not exactly sure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>last night i had this vivid dream that oscillated between myself being turned into a demon and holding a pillow in the fetal position begging &amp;ldquo;god&amp;rdquo; to have mercy on me,  that i’d do what he wanted.  that i would submit.  it kept oscillating back and forth along two parallel lines moving independently.  in the end i woke with a racing heartbeat and no resolution to it.  later in the evening i dreamnt i was going to marry this really hideous woman who had a fish that looked like a bass.  i kept repeating, &amp;ldquo;but i like her soul, but i like her soul.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>guess i just have to realize that i’m all fucked up right now.  i need a fucking cigarette, but am in the house of protestantism.  fuck.  maybe i’ll just go for a walk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>this weekend i’ve been subjected to a fullcourt press of strange looks and non-caring sighs from my family.  as if my normal self-deprecating and and self-analyzing nature wasn’t enough.  now i’m subjected to this as well.  as if i wasn’t stressed out enough, now i get to add this.  can no one merely empathize with my position and trust me to make the right decision?  i guess not.  excerpts from a conversation with a hero:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>so why aren’t you going to vanderbilt?  why don’t you want to go to law school?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>it isn’t that i don’t want to go to law school.  i just want to do other things.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>you know what kind of a pedigree you would give up by not going?  you know how well respected that is?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>the &amp;ldquo;oooo&amp;rdquo; factor diminishes exponentially with your radius from dixie.  it isn’t exactly harvard, nor is it florida state university. &lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>you know what kind of doors it would open for you?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>yes.  but at what cost in time and debt do i go into this thing &amp;ldquo;merely for options.&amp;rdquo;  i mean $150K in debt is a pretty fucking big gamble that i’m going to have some major employment opportunities waiting for me on the back side.  if i wanted to just keep writing i’d have to have some massive offers waiting on the table to afford a decent lifestyle plus that kind of a &amp;ldquo;mortgage.&amp;rdquo;  if i don’t go and i keep writing, i only have the minimum of debt and will probably be able to live fine on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;em>you know what kind of ass you would pull at a college campus?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>yes.  lots.  but is that why i’m going?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so here i am stressed out of my own mind and then all this stuff is added on top of it.  all my friends and family are asking me constantly what the hell i’m going to be doing in a week.  will it be law school will it be writing.  i know that they all intend well, i know that they were just concerned, but it is overfuckingwhelming on my end of the spectrum.  at least ten emails a day and at least four voicemails a day for the last week all asking the same question.  it would be fuck loads easier if i had an answer to give them.  either way, even if it was the answer that i don’t want to be giving them, right now i’d pick that shit over this ambiguous purgatory where i have to plan for all possibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so here i am in this house of death, watching both of my grandparents deteriorate before my very eyes.  my aunt is departing in tears, thoroughly convinced that one or both will die before she would have a chance to return.  my mother has put the world on her shoulders as usual is playing the martyr to a T.  and here i am.  detached and calloused to death because of my experiences.  when i’ve seen it so vividly, even those close to me become just another person on the battlefield.  how the HELL is that possible.  this is my mamo.  my grandmother.  why do i feel zero emotional attachtment to what is going on.  i realize that it is a coping mechanism, that i’m so terrified of facing my own mortality on any scale (probably because i don’t feel that my morality house is exactly in order) that i don’t deal with death.  that i just isolate it and do not force myself to face it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>but that is going to change real fast i have a notion.  we’ll just have to see how it all plays out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this is the most depressed i’ve been in a long, long time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In other words.  I’m all moved in.  It took me much of the day to move all that stuff over from xanga but we’re here now.  While I was scouring the bathroom I was thinking that there had to be an automated script that could move my shit for me and my doesn’t comet smell good.  But there wasn’t, and in fact it is a pain to wash off the sinks. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well it feels good to be here kids.  Lost the comments on my ole’ blog entries and my xanga subscriber (all one of her, poor, lonely shlub schlecking along some tundra screaming, &amp;ldquo;wi-fi, wi-fi, i need some wifi&amp;rdquo;) will feel abandoned now that she will have to bookmark my site.  But this is the wave of the future daddy-o, you just gotta ride it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the second thing that i’m learning is the integration of pop cultural reference.  although his pop cultural references aren’t allusions to vh1 shows, or US magazine articles, they are more like beethoven and nietzche (sorry about the germanic nature, blame him not me).  so i guess that it is more like literate references rather than pop cultural.  but he does these things to develop the theme, but not to develop the theme for him.  i have been working on this and thinking upon it more.  if you were to point to this movie quote, or say that this was like a bruce springsteen song (courtesy hornby) or whatnot…is that a copout.  i think it can be if you do it poorly.  however it can add a lot of color and depth to your characters if done correctly.  the bad thing about purely pop icons is that you would date your manuscript pretty distinctly.  if you were to step out a concentric ring from purely pop to somewhat enduring then you would not date it so much and more readers would have the opportunity to truly embrace what the hell you mean by &amp;ldquo;dropping names like change on a sunny day.&amp;rdquo; (as eric dsaid when he was drunk the other night. i’m not sure what he meant)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in the real world still waiting on the word on the next manuscript.  my editor likes it and they have circled it around SMP.  they were going to bring it up in production meeting to talk about whether they want it or not.  i am pretty confident, especially based upon our publicists comment to the assistant publisher (Senior VP), &amp;ldquo;I don’t care if it sucks, I can sell the fucking thing.&amp;rdquo;  So maybe i’ll know today, maybe i’ll know tomorrow, maybe i’ll know next week, maybe i’ll know in september.  Who knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Am back east, in NC (winston-salem) visiting best ole friend.  have put 2200 miles on my car over the last week, have visited one cousin, one brother, one college friend, one college, one elementary friend, one law school, and now one best friend.  if no word comes tomorrow on the deal i will be signing a nashville lease on monday and then will spend the rest of the week moving in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>this shit is getting tight.  and i don’t mean TI-EGHT.  i mean flippin’ close&lt;/p>

&lt;p>yougn dubliners were &amp;ldquo;celtish rock&amp;rdquo; which i wasn’t so sure about…but it really was riverdance meets pop rock, including a fiddler who looked like the midnight oil dude, a bassist who looked exactly how henry rollins would look if he let his vanity go and got semi-fat and a lead guitarist who reminded me of the lead guitarist from frank black and the catholics who in turn reminds me of david bowie, but the guy from the &amp;ldquo;dubs&amp;rdquo; didn’t remind me of bowie at all.  the lead singer’s voice was pretty smooth and their hooks were catchy.  they got all the whiteys out on the dance floor shaking their feet around, patty style.  there were a ton of beautiful people there…i know….welcome to aspen right?  but one in particular who had tons of curly red hair and a really pristine face.  maybe it was becuase i was at an irish concert that i was so taken by her.  anyway i went with my friend who was jetlagged and really tired and we left early and i didn’t talk to the red haired girl even though she was tossing me looks now and again.  but, whatever….that is my MO right?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>and i almost hit bambi’s mom on the drive home.  eventful, beautiful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>watched school of rock again tonight because i’d been singing led zeppelin to myself most of the hike, when i wasn’t day dreaming.  and face it, we all need our jack black fix from time to time. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>on my way to dinner i saw a shirt that amused me, simply as i do not understand it.  it was one of those white t-shirts with the collar and cuffs at the sleeves in some muted gray color.  the shirt in block letters said: TONGUE SHIRT. one word to each line.  i don’t understand. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>tongue shirt?  won’t even conjecture an answer.  so i’m back from my ten year reunion and i suppose that i should reflect on the major event for posterity sake.  except that i didn’t really think it was that major.  it just was there, another event in my life.  i wonder if the lack of tv and movies in my life is allowing me to separate myself from what pop culture tells me is significant and allowing to pass my own judgements?  probably not.  it is probably just that i felt it was a relaxed happening with some people i hadn’t seen before.  i suppose that there have been times in my life in between graduation and now when i would have been &amp;ldquo;out to prove all those fuckers wrong&amp;rdquo; about me.  but those times have passed.  it was odd that they inherently proved themselves wrong without any posturing on my part. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>this is the most tangible way the war changed me.  i don’t need it, any of it.  i’ve already done that and now i just get to live my life. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>sure, i’m still an egotistical bastard, but less so than i have been.  there is much i have left to do, more that i have left to learn, but less that i have left to prove.  in the hollywood sports flick parlance, i left it all out there on the field and i can just look back fondly and say i did the job that i did and now i can look forward. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>its probably all drivel, i realize.  less than a week left of snow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>if we are not constantly, vehemently justifying our existence would people still subscribe to the dogma?  i think that is the crux of the matter for some of the more learned leaders of my (former?) church.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>have finally sketched out the summary for what will be the final runthrough of the shield proposal.  if he doesn’t accept this one then i surrender.  this is original and scary and good and fuck him if he doesn’t see that.  i think he will, but i’m just laying down the law. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>at least i have decided to stay for the summer, have decided to accept the hiking guide job and have decided to stay in this apartment.  that feels good, and the only real decision i have to make now is whether or not i’ll be here the last week of august or in nashville.  am thinking that it will be nashville unless some very specific and grand things happen to make me stay.  although what those could be, even with my &amp;ldquo;specific&amp;rdquo; word choice, i only semi-know.  i know what things could complicate a decision, but i’m not sure what would complicate it to the point of tipping the scales in a direction that my logic has not leaned it towards already.  as if that makes sense…?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>took a long walk and sat by the river.  it is engorged today from all the snow we’ve been having followed closely by warm temperatures.  haven’t ridden my snowboard in two days, must do that tomorrow.  now i’m drivelling and you have stopped caring.  good-bye&lt;/p>

&lt;p>do you have to be drugged to appreciate drug induced art?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>cameron was down, again, this weekend, for the night and was telling me a funny story.  he want to his public library up there in jackson (wy) to see a fiddler who seems to be a performance poet of some kind.  apparently the guy is from alaska and he tells stories, plays irish jigs on his fiddle and weaves wilderness poetry in the cracks.  all is well at this point we are very interested, right?  he has a cabin up in nome, ak and spends much time up there in a state of mental oneness with himself.  still OK right? &lt;/p>
&lt;p>well the crowd seemed to be excited about him, they were an ecclectic mix of high school students there for extra credit, families there for ANYTHING different to keep the kids enthralled for &amp;ldquo;a few minutes, a few minutes, a few minutes of SIIIIIILEnce&amp;rdquo; (paul westerburg), old couples and cam his sister and best friend in the crowd.  his comment on the crowd was they were the only three people among the ten’s that were crowding the small space that were under thirty-five and not forced to be there by some outside force.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then the guy took the stage, burnt as cheech in 1978 after a hard day’s filming.  he told half of his stories before interrupting himself with some fiddling that would meander (always a medley becuase he could not decide on one song) for a few bars before asking a rhetoric or non-rhetoric question to the audience.  from time to time he would stop dead in his tracks and examine the drop ceiling tiles, i wonder if he was counting the holes in them or merely wondering in his stoned mind how they got up there.  at one point he stopped dead during an irish influence song based on a famous song everyone should know, but only loosely so you may not recognize it as this famous song and since he had titled the song texas you could just know it as texas from heretofore, and told the crowd that there was some &amp;ldquo;really good listening going one right now…&amp;rdquo; either that or he was just so out there that they were concentrating too hard to figure out his synopsial-crossings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the unfortunate part, according to cam, was that his poetry was pretty good and his delivery, at least of the poetry, was quite good.  it seems unfortunate that it got drowned out by the cacophony of the other madnesses. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it appears that i will not be joining jack on the national book and appearances tour.  i’m more than a little pissed and upset about the situation.  what i don’t want to happen is for a wedge to be driven between him and i.  i’m not sure if that isn’t going to become an inevitability (maybe i need more negatives in there), hopefully it work itself out, who knows.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>last night i had a quasi-date with the guat_princess.  (as a side note i have decided the best thing about blogging is that i get to give real people fake names and pretend that i’m in sex in the city).  i’ll ruin it for all of you:  the act banished any interest that i had.  it was at dinner when it hit me.  during the movie (lame i know, but it was what she wanted to do.) there was much incidental contact.  i didn’t do what i’ve done too many times in the past and act upon it.  i just didn’t care.  so we went to the worst mexican restaurant ever afterwards.  i knew better than to go since it was horrible when big perm and i went, but again i bowed under the wind of her pressure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we were speaking of cats for some odd, random reason and it was when she hit me.  she is exactly like a siamese cat: strinking and unobtainable.  i can’t really read her or figure her out, and i’ve stopped trying.  the enigma isn’t going to draw me further in, i refuse to let it. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>exit stage left one marginal interest, enter stage right another.  we’ll see how that goes tomorrow (or the next day, or monday, or tuesday….that’s how i roll). &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the culinary interest of the evening is regarding tater tots: they make me happy.  think that i’ll take a bath.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>i also think that it is stupid people week and have been loudly blinking that out of my flourescent mouth.  i swear to god i’ve gotten the stupidest fucking people all week wasting my time.  i mean, it isn’t like i’ve been terribly busy, i’ve just been sitting there when not dealing with the stupid people.  but i’d much rather sit there than deal with morons.  rule number one or not, they tire me and make me sore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>finished koopman’s book this week and almost done with 100 years….been a while huh?  well fuck you, i read slowly.  in regards to koop’s mss:  it is a decent account.  i don’t think that his sales will come close to ours, but it was still really good to relive things through another’s eyes.  jack didn’t seem concerned about him not corraborating our story, however, i was.  turned out that the only discrepancies i found were so minor that many copy editor’s wouldn’t have caught them.  the problem for his book is that he was an embedded reporter with a miltiary unit in iraq.  big flipping deal napoleon.  there are only a ga-gillion of thos books floating around and the big publishers with the big advertising budgets and big pull with BN and amazon already have their embedded reporter goes to iraq book.  his two-bit publisher just won’t be able to make things happen like the rolling stone dude’s guys (HarperCollins, I think) were about to.  And thus his book sold well.  that said, i liked it–a lot.  almost better than ours.  the thing that was terribly touching was that he included many of the emails that he received while he was with us.  it was very poignant to me seeing the other side, a side that i have been hidden from for some reason.  when you are there and in it you know the dangers that you’re taking, when you’re back here and watching and waiting your mind fears the worst.  like my craziness with marine_gurl a while ago….damn thoughts, why wont’ they just go away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>law school you ask?  what the hell is he bringing that up for?  don’t know, just thought i’d share a bit of foreshadowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>lastly, we’re back to the drawing board for the forth time on the shield proposal, not a biggy, guess i look at the other attempts as workouts.  at some point we’ll actually get into the game on this one, i suspect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>have fun and smile, i am.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>so it seems to me that i may be reading too much into the HST death.  it seems that no one cares.  am i the only one?  and i dont’ even really care, what I do care about is the social phenomenon the pop counter-culter icon itself. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i actually don’t really give a damn that some old man put a .45 into his mouth, cocked it up towards the top of his head, took in one final, fatalistic and resigned deep nose-breath, sighed it out slowly, thought, &amp;ldquo;damn i’m wasted&amp;rdquo; and pulled the trigger straight back, all after he had previously played with the semi-automatic handgun for a number of hours while he sipped whiskey (or gorged on it depending on your alcoholism perspective) and free-based coke off some old metal spoon he had been using for just that purpose for over 20 years.  finally when his siatica acted up one too many times the old fucker said, that’s it and picked up the hand gun that he had been twirling and caressing with his fingertips on the side table.  the sound of the gun being pulled off the table and then checked to make sure it was loaded.  the sound of the slide going home on a full chamber and giving one final, audible resolute, detestable click were the only sounds in the room.  after one last gu8lp of his favorite whiskey and teh inevitable temporary paralysis that accompanies drinking any hard liquor neat, which as we all know is followed by the bitter beer face.  but probably not for this veteran, he had stifled that face many years ago in some masculine escapade where he determined he was more man than any of the other fuckers at the woody creek tavern and he wasn’t going to give in to them and their bitter beer faces, no matter how good or bad the whiskey, his reaction was always the same, simple zen realization that the hard liquor was trickling down his throat and going to further intocicate him.  that was it.  the gun was cool on his lips and semi-comforting at first and in his completely obliterated baseline state he didn’t even really care about that or the fact that his siatica was really hurting.  the liquor was literally eating him from the liver out and he didn’t give a fuck becuase it had been with him too long and there was no way you were going to talk him out of his bottle now.  the only way to end this thing was in one blaze of glory and since he wasn’t a terribly courageous man he would just cower and take his own life–Papa H style.  The tip of the gun pointed toward the roof and then exploded with fire and small bits of metal and one large piece of lead.  the fire created a presser that his closed lips could not contain and it then exploded out of his mouth as the bullet was careering through his sinuses towards the middle of his brain.  HST wasn’t fucking around he knew exactly what he was going to do.  he wouldn’t have fucked it up.  the large caliber bullet had fragmented somewhere between his brain and sinuses and the pressure that was leading the bullet had already cracked his skull when the fragments pushed half of his scalp off his head and onto the ceiling.  that was it.  his legacy was complete. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it was the only way that it could end for the comet from another time.  other than being an icon his relavancy, although surely needed, was called into question on many questions by others and surely by himself.  all he ever wanted to do was to raise hell and to push his personal agenda.  so fuck that mother fucker.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i guess i really only care becuase it is something to care about.  there isn’t much else that i can get passionate about in this town right now since my sights have been moved elsewhere.  so that’s it!  told you it was graphic.&lt;/p>

His name is Hunter S. Thompson, if you don’t know that name, google him.  I find some odd parallel’s in my living in the same town with the counterculture icon when he dies and with Eric’s story of his friend farting next to Allen Ginsberg’s coffin during some candlelit vigil to the old beat-en poet.  Fast-forwarding and keeping my vile flatulence under control I paint the background of the piece before revealing the subject.  He died two nights ago now, shot himself in the head with a .45.  The rumors around town vary, but the prevailing story is he was old and dying and he just sped up the process.  Many have discounted my first thought that it was  drunken accident by the posterboy for &amp;ldquo;alcoholics among us.&amp;rdquo;  His &amp;ldquo;compound&amp;rdquo; [paragraphical insert: he didn't have a house, the local's tend to pay him some sort of weird homage among the castles that litter the countryside up in the extremely posh neighborhood where he lives, he doesn't have a simple house like Michael Douglas or Prince Bandar, but a fortified compound&amp;hellip;.I guess that is how you can standout in a place like Assssspen.] was two doors down from where my landlord lives.  We stop the story there merely to rewind a bit, because I don’t think you know this part of the story.  I rent a townhouse in a small &amp;ldquo;suburb&amp;rdquo; of the spotlight in the valley that is aspen from a lady who is the personal assistant to some bigwig Aspen-ite.  She was married before and currently a widow and her late-hubby was some 18 trillion-th generational Aspen-ite.  So she is very ingrained with the local history of the place.  Well she is in this odd relationship that after months of observation I cannot commit to any sort of vague or clear categorization–with my roommate.  To summarize, I live with the &amp;ldquo;boyfriend,&amp;rdquo; becuase she is still the personal assistant and as the bigwig grows older and more senile she must spend more time up there near him.  So she has a guest house beside the castle, nothing special in this fucked up world.  Her house is a few acres away from the compound.  The first time I went up to her house to sign my lease I was jolted into some flashbacks when the windows of her house rumbled and the floor of her elevated treated hardwood flooring shook under my dirty new balance shoes.  When I got up from my involuntary temporary fetal position she told me not to worry that it was just Hunter blowing dynamite which was much worse than the naval flare guns or the simple handguns and shotguns.  Me being the Assssspen virgin I wondered aloud, Hunter who?  She told me HST, and I thought, oh, that freak.  Well, I put that memory away on some unused shelf beside the time in gradeschool when Justin Birmele and I were filling out some form and he said &amp;ldquo;sex, yes please,&amp;rdquo; in response to the &amp;ldquo;male or female&amp;rdquo; response we were supposed to give–until the last few days.  I was speaking with my terribly off roommate about HST tonight and how I had grabbed a few of the Aspen Daily New’s to send to a few lucky friends and then he responded in his burnt-out-smoked-as-much-hash-as-cheech way that he had something to show me.  The he dug for a while and came to my room, a rare occurance and asked if I wanted to read the greatest HST shit ever.  I said, why not, I don’t have anything going on, being between books and waiting on many things to happen before Jim will take our next proposal to the street even though it is close to finished.  Then matt, the roommate, brought out these rolled up things that his &amp;ldquo;girlfriend&amp;rdquo; my landlord had gotten many years ago, 1970 in fact.  That year HST was going to run for sheriff and to bolster his campaign and also to promote his personal racket and other things he and a local artist, thomas benton, made these &amp;ldquo;newspapers.&amp;rdquo;  I am not sure how many of them were done, but the following excerpt was taken from the June 30, 1970 edition, Wallpapers No. 2. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess some of you could see my sending this through some tiny clear wires that light passes through and eventually it will pop up on your screens as some sore of endorsement of HST’s lifestyle or his belief system.  That isn’t the case, I’m simply sharing a piece of history with you.  enjoy it or don’t, your choice:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>*from the class of ’58…EPITAPH…to the class of ‘70&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following article – or Commencement Address – has a strange history.  It was originally written in 1958, by Milton Mayer, and published that year in The Christian Century – where it was noticed by a young writer at &lt;em>Time&lt;/em> magazine.  He added an introduction of his own and sent it up the tube to the ME’s office, where it was rejected out of hand.  &lt;em>Time&lt;/em> was still pruning its “upbeat” image in’58; the package was still super-slick, with no room at all for depressing things like this.  I was working there at the time –supposedly learning “The Business” –and in my role as trainee/copyboy/hired-punk-of-all-trades, I often found myself delivering rejected articles back to the writers.  Usually I read them enroute, and in this case I decided to make a xerox copy of the reject before letting it go….if for no other reason than that it was very weird thing to find floating around in the editorial mill at &lt;em>Time.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The writer, Jack Skow, was not surprised when I brought the manuscript back to him.  We talked for a while about &lt;em>Time&lt;/em>, writing and the whorish hazards of a scene we were both just getting into 00 and we assured each other, very firmly, that no journalist with any self0respect could work very long for *Time, *and that we would both be gone very shortly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That night, after work, I went back to my apartment and dropped my copy of Skow’s doomed article in a trunk, where it spent the next 12 years.  I was living, that winter, in a freak-slum just off the Columbia University campus at 113th and Broadway.  &lt;em>Time&lt;/em> was paying my tuition, presumably on the theory that sooner or later I would “settle down” and become a useful cog-wheel in the Luce empire.  I was a nice arrangement – for me, at least – but my clearest memory of that era is a night in the West End Bar when Jack K made his first appearance on national TV.  On The Road was just out, and the West End was jammed with a wild hell-broth of student-types who cheered crazily at everything K said.  His words hardly mattered.  He was a “beatnik,” whatever that meant, and so were we.  K was speaking for all of us; he was a young Columbia refugee who ran amok and still made it big, on his own terms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That was the night, I think, when I decided to quite my job at* Time* and get into full-time craziness.  The first year was heavy, but by 1960 with JFK in the White House it was suddenly not so bad to be a misfit.  Kennedy found them useful, and his taste set the style; by the end of ’63 exmisfits had accumulated such vast leverage on all fronts that even now – seven evil years later and despite relentless weeding by the best hired pros in the game – the American Establishment is still riddled with very competent Kennedy-style misfits.  Nixon has never understood them, and John Mitchell never will.  They are a strange breed – cynical as old pawnbrokers, yet haunted losers, still waiting…not liking themselves too well and sometimes feeling half-dead, or maybe just half-alive; and usually about half-corrupt, in the shadow-memory of things un-done and un-tried….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thinking along these lines the other night I found myself rooting through an old trunk, looking for my Xerox copy of Milton Mayer’s 1958 commencement address.  It was there, along with Skow’s original Time-style introduction:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-corrupt-and-the-dead">&lt;em>The Corrupt and the Dead&lt;/em>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>“To a generation that sometimes calls itself Beat came a message from the generation that is old enough to know what a moral beating modern man gives himself, In the Christian Century, middle-aged (49) Author Milton Mayer (The Revolution in Education) writes a dour document address to the class of ‘58”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“If my own history and the history of the race is instructive, this commencement is for nearly every last one of you the commencement of disintegration.  You have lived 20 years in a deplorable society.  You have lived sheltered lives, but you have had no one to shelter you from your parents and teachers.  Your parents have done what they could to adjust you to the deplorable society to which they have successfully adjusted themselves.  When they said you were improving, they meant that you were getting to be like them.  When they said they hoped you would keep out of trouble, they meant that you should not do anything that they wouldn’t do.  But some of the things that they wouldn’t do should have been done.  The condition of society is the proof of their criminal negligence.  Your teachers are no better.  They have done as they were told, and in a deplorable society there are some things that men are told to do that no men should do. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Like your teachers and your parents before you, you will be told to do bad things in order to hold your job.  In college you may have quite the campus daily or defied the old fraternity on principle.  It will be harder to quite the metropolitan daily or defy the Old Country on principle; it will be easier to forget the principle.  You will have wives (at least one apiece) and children to maintain.  You will have a home and mortgage to enlarge.  And neighbors who are having their children’s teeth straightened.  Your dentist’s bills alone will corrupt you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“You protest my melancholy prediction, but the Great Actuarial Table is against you.  Twenty-five years from now, nine out of ten of you (or all ten) will tolerate an existence which, if you could foresee it now, you would call intolerable.  You won’t even know that you are corrupt.  You will have friends who praise in you the characteristics you have in common with them.  And if, some sudden night, you go berserk and bawl out that life is a sell, they will put you to bed with the assurance that you will be all right in the morning.  And you will be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Twenty-five years from now you will celebrate your 20th wedding anniversary.  Because you love your wife – still more if you don’t – you will want to celebrate it in style.  You will reserve a window table for two at the choicest restaurant in town, and the champagne bucket will be at the table when you arrive.  AS your eye travels down the menu it will be distracted by something outside the window, which will prove to be a hungry man.  Do you know what you will do then, 25 years from now? You will call the maitre-d’ and tell him to have the drapes pulled, and he will tell the waiter, and he will tell the bus boy, who will do it.  Thirsty, and a little nervous still, you will sip your glass, forgetting to toast your wife, and resume your study of the menu.  And then for the first time you will see, in fine italic print at the bottom, the words, ‘the Management reserves the right to refuse service to anyone.’  And then you will know (for you will be an educated man) that you are sitting in a Jim Crow restaurant.  What will you do?  You will stay at the table and order your dinner and eat it.  You will have been measured for corruption and found to fit.  I do not doubt that I would have raised the flag at Iwo Jima, rather than let it drop in public.  But I was the man who took his wife to dinner at the Jim Crow restaurant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I don’t mean that you won’t continue to have good impulses.  You will.  From time to time, as the vestige of your springtime idealism stirs you, you will want to do the right thing.  But you will have to put off doing it until you have buried your father, and then your mother, your brother, your children, and your grandchildren.  You may life to be very old, but you will not outlive the last descendant for whose sake you will suppress your good impulses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“I would not steal another man’s watch unless my children were starving, and my children would never be starving.  Nor will yours’ the reason is that you will have been corrupted.  Your corruption will save you from having to decide whether to steal another man’s watch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Other, more agreeable commencement orators have warned you of life’s pitfalls.  I tell you that you are marked for them.  I believe you will not escape them because I see nothing in your environment that has prepared you even to recognize them.  You were divinely endowed to know right and to do right, and you have before you, in the tradition of your country and of human history, the vision to help you if you will turn to it.  But the dictates of your society, of any society, will not serve you.  They are the dictates that corrupted your parents and your teachers.  If Socrates did not know where virtue came from — and he didn’t – neither do I.  He pursued it earlier and harder than anyone else and concluded that it was the gift of God.  In despair of your parents and your society, of your teachers and your studies, of your neighbors and your friends, and above all of your fallen nature and the Old Adam in you, I bespeak for you the gift of God.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>postscript&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>            Now, 12 years later, that late-1950’s world that Mayer was talking about seems a million miles away.  Jack K is dead, at the age of 52, and so is Eisenhower.  Jack Skow quite &lt;em>Time&lt;/em> right on schedule, and went to work for the &lt;em>Saturday Evening Post&lt;/em>.  He got married and had a few children, and when the &lt;em>Post&lt;/em> folded he went to free-lancing.  The last time I saw his byline was in &lt;em>Playboy&lt;/em> at the time.  They assigned me to write about Jean-Claude Killy’s new lifestyle – which I did, but they refused to print it.  And &lt;em>Time&lt;/em> larded the irony by quoting me to the effect that *Playboy *is “a conspiracy of anemic masturbators.”  That was accurate, but &lt;em>Time&lt;/em> couldn’t handle the rest of that quote – which appeared, for good or ill, in &lt;em>Scanlan’s Monthly.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>            But at this point – and in this context 00 the quote hardly matters.  Neither Skow nor I understood, back then, what Mayer was really saying.  There was no way to know, without going to the well, and even now I can’t be sure Mayer was right.  But I’d like to talk to Jack Skow about it, and probably I will sometime soon.  Or maybe not; some things are better left alone, or at least left quietly.  My own history, since then, would twist the nerves of any hiring agent or corporate personnel director like the man who originally signed me on for Time, Inc.  He told me I would “do well,” and no doubt he told Skow the same thing.  Jack K never worked for &lt;em>Time&lt;/em>, but he was a football hero at Columbia – and that knowledge must surely put a lump in the throats of all the good folk around the fountain in St. Petersburg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>            As for Mayer’s “dour document,” well…my own advice, on the basis of experiences, is to read it once, quickly, then stuff it in a trunk and read it again about 10 years later.  It comes on very slow, and some of the lines are dated…but I think its still worth reading, even though &lt;em>Time&lt;/em> wouldn’t print it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>have been reading &amp;ldquo;one hundred years of solitude&amp;rdquo; which i have slowly come to realize is a massive undertaking in which garcia marquez has attempted to comment on the entire history of the human race and i have taken to internally calling it the &amp;ldquo;brief history of time, latin american version.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p>
&lt;p>have been playing massive amounts of jazz from my gaudy collection that has become unruly unless i listen to some as-yet-un-heard tune-age. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the reading and jazz seem to be at odds with each other.  the reading has rekindled the sense of adventure.  that fire has been stoked by the fact that i have not left this place in two months.  i haven’t driven for more than 15 minutes.  i haven’t left the 30 square mile radius.  i have not been outside one of the three towns i’ve been habitating.  the fact that marquez speaks of places i know nothing about not to mention the quest for adventure beginning to mount as a major theme in the book have both made me go &amp;ldquo;ummm.&amp;rdquo;  the jazz is pulling me the other way.  it always make me think of calm sunday mornings reading the new york times over a steaming mug of coffee while it plays quietly or not so quietly in the background.  walking around in a hugh heffner robe onto the balcony and looking out over some scenic view and thinking, damn that’s nice.  it makes me long for some sort of a life that i am not sure if i even want, but the picture is there in my head and some sort of desire is attached to it.  always has been.  the dream of settlign here in aspen plays off of that becuase this is the type of place where you really can do something like that.  if you only have enough money to support those muses.  it is so cyclical with me the nomadic desires rise and fall and rise and fall and i can feel them rising right now.  in one hand it is a copout that makes me not want to participate fully in life NOW becuase i’m always looking to get out of this and move somewhere new.  i think that it has become some sort of a coping mechanism on some level.  but whatever it is there and there is no sense trying to fight it.  the only real compromise or satisifaction would be found in having a home of one’s own and traveling from there.  but there are so many drawbacks to that as well.  what if it isn’t in a good place, what if you cannot stand where you are, what, what, what, why. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i’m just a bucket of indecision.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>speaking of crazy scientists, tonight 20/20 had on the guy who runs BALCO, the steroid factory.  or at least the one that has gotten all the press.  he was an interesting guy, mainly b/c of how unrepentant he was.  he portrayed illegal drug usage to be on an epidemic proportions.  that does not surprise me.  the few things that did surprise me, though, was the lack of finger pointing directed at football and at basketball.  football received one very small segment that was directed at romanousky (who strikes me as an ass anyway) and that was it.  the majority of the program was involved with sprinters.  with the remainder going to baseball.  i think that viewers were much more interested and connected with the baseball segments as people don’t really internalize T&amp;amp;F unless you are into it.  the normal majority of people probably routed for marion jones during the olympics, forgot about her for four years, were reminded of who the hell she was and went, oh yeah i rooted for her before.  there is not following of the olypmic sports in this country like there is of: baseball, basketball and football.  not a unique comment. however, i was interested to see that football came away almost completely clean and of course the stereotype is for that sport to be the most prone to steroid and performance enhancing potions.  i am not as surprised to see basketball, which has its own problems and could ill afford to have this pile one, not get pointed towards.  it is a sport that is much more skill related and a lot less pure performance related.  unless you are defending against shaq in the low post you don’t have a terrible need to become much stronger.  anyone can be fast on a breakaway, but you still have to dribble the ball on the breakaway.  so i could see why some may take EPO which is an endurance drug (clear throat, pause, Kobe) but other than that i just don’t see the need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>my xmas cd’s are finished burning.  yeah i can have theme music for the car now.  four cd’s worth.  god bless i-tunes.  now i just need a bigger harddrive and an ipod so i can really work on my music collection! &lt;/p>
&lt;p>on a lift today i was struck by the pack resemblance that all the duders maintain.  for those of you that don’t know what a duder is, watch the XGames for those are duders and the heros of the rest of the duders.  baggy pants with long poofy jackets.  beenies and goggles like the rest of us, but they maintain them at precarious angles where the rest of us like to keep them at straight angles to the world.  they talk with an advanced vocabulary.  that is the only way to describe it, b/c the rest of the world has no clue what the f they are saying!  i never noticed before how terribly rare it is to see them by their lonesome.  there is either a complete lack or an infestation.  they are just pack animals.  herd animals.  they like to keep the air of superiority even if they aren’t that good and it is helped by the twin tip skiers who have wakes the size of slalom water skiers consisting of snow that will blind, pelt and annoy any outsider who tries to get too close to the pack.  i also realized today, well, remembered in fact, how much hotter a chick in twin tips is in comparison to a chick on a snowboard.  for some reason chicks on snowboards just aren’t that hot to me any more.  what the F am i getting that old?  damn life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>rode the lift with this guy who was 82 today.  he was awesome.  and old.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>enjoy life b/c what the hell else can you do with it!!!!  all from assssspen for now.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>i had reached a point of something this summer that was unlike anything i had ever reached before.  i am not sure whether that was a zen state of living or just the ability to thoughtfully live in the present.  whatever title you choose to give to it i was there.  i wasn’t working, but i was constantly working.  i was living like i hadn’t lived before.  although i had taken the spill off the rock and the whole head thing i was past that to a point.  i wasn’t able to lead climb but i was able to climb again.  i was running rivers, i was wakeboarding.  but all of those i think were secondary.  really what i was doing was reading and working.  it didn’t seem like that to my goal driven mother, but that is what was happening.  it was all internalized and no one but me was able to see it.  i didn’t have some sort of a strange glow about me like i had just had sex (which was not happening on a daily basis at least) or that i had just been baptized into some evangelical cult.  it was on some levels deeper than that and probably on some levels shallower. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>what was happening was i was changing the way my mind was working.  i was observing things deeper.  i always could read people and decypher what their likely motivations for this or that were.  but suddenly i realized that i was able to internalize their story in a way that i hadn’t before.  maybe i was just beginning to fancy myself as a writer, or maybe i was slowly becoming one.  as i was living the life on the rocks in the river or in panera things were becoming crystallized to me.  i was able to look at colors and realize that they were there.  i was slowing down.  i told brian once about this and he replied with the quote from happy gilmore:  welcome to my world gramma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and then that was shattered.  or i should rephrase it properly, i allowed it be shattered.  i had the fling with marine_gurl that i will always wonder about.  why did i let myself do that?  was i a search for belonging or was it living how i wanted to live or was it more vindictive than that?  did i want to prove to her that she had made the wrong decision those years ago when she dumped me.  and not becuase i regretted my current life, but that i was still angry for all the hurt she threw at me?  i remain unsure of the answers to those questions, and they aren’t the point of this post.  the point is that i was taken out of that zen state of everything and nothingness.  or to use an existential reference i was taken out of my transcendence and into immanence.  (or do i have those backwords, i guess it doesn’t matter)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>what happened was this, i returned to my familiar goal oriented way of thinking.  and since i wasn’t achieving anything i allowed myself to daydream of when i would have achieved these stated goals, and i don’t even remember what they may have been.  i became unhappy and unsettled for a long period of time.  i guess that is it.  after sitting here for five minutes trying to figure out what the next sentence is, i guess that there isn’t one.  that is the bottom line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>but now things are different.  i wonder if it is the environment, the relationships (or lack of), or just mindset.  like i’ve said too many times in this post, i don’t really know.  but i feel that i’m slowly returning to that place.  of course i will always daydream, but i am not letting myself be driven by those daydreams, they are pleasant places to visit but i’m not sure that i truly expect for them to become a reality.  is that giving up or living inside of the real?  i’m not sure, i guess much of the answer to that question would depend on what you are dreaming of and the plausibility of that dream.  most of mine are implausible and that is what makes them dreams.  i think that is fundamentally different than what the famous successful people proclaim from podiums at self-help seminars:  follow your dreams and all that.  i think that those kinds of dreams are different.  of course i have those too, and frankly i’m living that.  i’m following that advice, and i’m not sure where it is leading, and i’m not sure that it matters. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i could be in law school right now.  close to my family and safe in vanderbilt where i would have a built in community of friends between my peers and eric’s already established community.  but here i am, moving (again) to a place where i knew no one simply becuase i wanted to ski.  i am writing everyday and not sure that i’m getting better but at least am getting smoother.  and that is that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>in my mind this post boils down to this:  i guess that i am following my dreams, but for once the correct ones, the obtainables that i will have to work for, but not the unobtainables that fall into my lap. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>and that is what i feel terribly good about.  i feel like some fucking switch in my mind has been turned back on, and now i’m feeling my way towards a safe well-lit place that i had glimpsed before but never really touched.  let’s see if i can get there.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>first there was the major conflict, and that one was internal.  i left 29 palms about 10 days ago thinking that i would have resolution on the aspen job quickly.  either she would offer me the job or she would tell me to pack sand.  at least that was how it was in the movie that i was playing over and over again in my head with various endings and middles.  so i drive to aspen and i interview with her.  the lady is really nice as is everyone around the mountain.  a few things happen (which would add color here, but alas, i cannot remember) that spark my imagination to take over.  &amp;ldquo;oh, they are omen’s that i shall be here for the winter, wasn’t that nice of the powers that be to do that for me….thank you powers that be.&amp;rdquo;  and so it goes.  after what i thought was a pretty good interview (and it turns out a great interview, but not good enough, too much foreshadowing, i don’t know) i ask her when she will make her decision.  &amp;ldquo;monday.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;monday? holy cow that is a while.&amp;rdquo;  is my thought response.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>OK no big deal, i have not been to colorado since i’ve realized that it is OK to develop opinions of your own outside of groupthink, aka since i graduated high school.  so i decide to roll down to boulder.  prior internet research had revealed a hostel down there where i can get a private room for something on the order of 30 a night.  easy peesy i think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so i roll to boulder and the town is remarkable.  yaddy yadda.  i liked it yaddy yadda. well then i wait all day on monday and then most of the morning on tuesday.  i’m feeling really displaced and really poor and really just blah.  finally the chica calls me and says, well i chose someone that was more familiar with aspen ski schools and whatnot, but would you be interested in this other job.  i thought what the hey.  so i jump in the car and start heading back out towards the mountains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>luckily about the time that i arrive in glenwood springs, the major turnoff from the interstate and one of the few places along the &amp;ldquo;I-70 corridor&amp;rdquo; where you have excellent cell coverage, this lady calls me.  we talk for not very long and she offers me the job, taking phone calls from tara reid’s personal assistant when she wants lift tix and ski skool lessons.  fine, easy job i think, plus i think that is a chick’s job so there should be a high percentage of ladies around, even if they are married they’ll wanna hook me up with their single friends.  so i accept their offer.  and i head down to snowmass and shake their hands and get my paperwork and all, finally heading to the aspen hostel where it is a few dollars more expensive but equally blase. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>sitting on my bed, cell in hand i break out the papers and start calling people.  i call about 15 people and three get back to me.  one is a weirdo that wanted approximately a million dollars to move into his campy altar to all the is kitsch and ugly, the second was an old lady whose first words out of her mouth were how i was to keep the room spotless and make my bed everyday and keep the showerwalls scrubbed and finally the third lady seemed nice, but i couldn’t see the place until the following morning.  so after about the 17th night in a row of fitfull, stressed sleep i wake up and come visit the third place. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>it is actually a sane place, internet, good cell reception, furnished with nice furniture, a TV, heat, and not too expensive, it met all my criteria in that order and i was pleased so i signed the lease on the spot and gave her my money and felt good about myself.  went to my orientation, got my ski pass and moved in and got a post office box and a bank account and generally became settled over the course of today and the previous two.  i feel more settled now than since i left 29 palms the first time. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>running parrallel to this has been an emotional rollercoaster that i refuse to ride with regards to the writing.  shooter is now almost finished, we have 21 of 27 chapters completed and next week we should finish the rest and have everything into charlie and hopefully approved so we can look at the check sometime in the middle of december.  jack has been courting the head of publicity who we found out was charlie’s boss big time.  it turns out that he has lots of power in the company and we let the dog slip out about our project and he got totally jazzed about it.  apparently along a similar timeline jim let slip to charlie about our project too.  so both of them know about it.  according to jim that could work for us, but it could also work against us because it is possible that they wouldn’t want to make a move until they saw sales results on shooter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>well today was the apex of all of this, and if i ws less tired and drained i could do a much better job with the narrative and really have built up the suspense, but sucks to be you the reader, because i’m just going to cut to the chase.  jim loved our project.  he thinks that it is sellable, he thinks that we can do this for a living, he thinks that we are going to make money, and decent money too.  he liked our writing style and our characters.  what he didnt’ like was the plot premise of our book, he didn’t like it being historical fiction and he didn’t like the lack of a &amp;ldquo;face to the villian.&amp;rdquo;  but the plot wasn’t the important thing to me it was the writing style and the characters that we developed.  we can plug those characters now into a different scene without a problem.  so now we are back to work hardcore on shield and we are both jazzed and charged about the project.  we’ll see where it goes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>but to get here in the form that would really be acceptable it’ll take a little while.  at least through the winter.  i could must stay here, find a job and a room somewhere and settle down.  i don’t think that is how i’d like to roll it.  i think that i’d really like to settle here, with my stuff, in an apartment, yaddy yadda.  but that will take money which i don’t have and time which i do have.  they will have to coincede and have not yet. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the good thing about visiting this town is that i feel like i’m coming to grips with the picture of how my life will be if the writing thing can actually happen.  i’ve retained a good grasp of what lawyer casey would be like:  vandy, nyc, suburbia.  but i have had too many pictures of what writer casey would look like.  i think that this would be it.  boulder-writer-casey.  i like the thought.  just like always it seems i’m in a holding pattern.  hopefully jim will get back to us this week with some news and i can start planning on writing or law-ing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i have to wait till monday to find out about the aspen job.  i went by breck and i like the scene there, but it is a long, convuluted process getting a job at the vail resorts and i don’t think that i’m going to fuck with it.  so like so many other times in my life all my eggs are in one basket:  aspen.  if marge calls me tomorrow and says no then back east for mamo’s birthday.  if she calls and tells me yeah then off to aspen and searching for tix to dave’s wedding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i guess that is about it.  i’m leaving the library now to walk a mile or so to the rocks and fall off of them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>my two predictions for the election tomorrow are this:  number one: there will be the largest turnout ever.  number two: there will not be the major problems that everyone is claiming there will be and there will actually be a clear winner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>it seems that whenever the press proclaims that something will be a major problem it never ends up turning out thusly.  like the old &amp;ldquo;sunscreen&amp;rdquo; song. the real troubles in your life are things that hit you on some idle tuesday.  and worrying is like trying to solve an algebra problem by chewing bubblegum.  classic!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>preliminary results on the novel proposals were received from jim, the agent, today:  Damn, you Marines don’t do anything half-assed. This is good stuff! And lots of it, too. I’ve read about half of LIBERTY’S SHIELD in this office this morning and will finish and report this week if I can steal enough reading time from my family. Jim. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i think that is good.  we’ll find out. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>well i’m drunk enough now in celebration and in my standard wine drinking formula that i’ll go to bed now and revel in the fact that my agent actually liked something that i wrote and then i’ll get up tomorrow, hope that my van sells quickly and hope that i can talk the aspen chick into giving me a job on friday when i interview with her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>the first is to wait until the rack comes in the mail.  i broke down and ordered it even though i didn’t want to spend the moola.  i had to have something to carry the boards and my bouldering pad on.  it’ll just make everything easier. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>the second is to finally sell the van.  i lowered the prices through the floor on ebay and have been getting some good bites even though i’m only a day into the auction which will end on wednesday.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>so worst case scenario i’ll be able to leave on thursday now for an interview on friday.  best case scenario the van sells early on buy it now and the rack gets here as scheduled on tuesday.  then i could leave on wednesday for a thursday interview. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i suspect that this is one of those things where the earlier the better my chances of getting a job are.  aspen looks very kool, dwarfing the cool quotient of mammoth.  they are having the X games there.  they have two different concert series that roll through town.  there are 100 bars and restaurants and coffee shops.  there are four mountains to ride/ski.  so many aspects make it a good decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>of course i don’t have the job, but my ego tells me that i will. and i feel really good about the aspen decision if it comes to fruitition.  we’ll see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>shooter has gone to D&amp;amp;A even though the rewrites are not complete.  we should be getting the money on that before thanksgiving.  jim has the two proposals we’ve worked up now.  he gets back from san diego on sunday so we should get some feedback this week.  lots happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we’re watching the world’s biggest outdoor cocktail party and i just saw the funniest commercial.  a cow decked out in flippers and floaties and a pool skirt jumped off this diving board at a bar-b-q and drowned out the burgers.  then there was a cow draped in a sign, &amp;ldquo;eat mor chikin.&amp;rdquo;  which, of course, is the chik-fil-a motto.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>f-ing hi-larry-ous. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>keep on keepin’ on….we’ll see how things go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>watched two movies this week:  huckabees and friday night lights.  i want to speak on huckabees, maybe later, maybe not.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>now?  now, i think that overall society is more involved with trying to get ahead then they are with sharing things.  i think that my generation will have a much lower divorce rate than the baby boomers had, and we will probably be the first generation since the 1900′s to have a lower divorce rate then our parents.  however sometimes i wonder how fulfilling the relationships are.  many people are spending so much time in pursuit of objects that i wonder how much of the world they are enjoying.  now that seems a bit off the point, but it isn’t.  there is the quality of life issue at stake.  if you aren’t happy in your own life then you may not be able to find happiness in your partner.  maybe your partner is where you will find your happiness, all is wrong with the world outside your arms, or something to that effect.  i doubt that though.  yes having a companion to come home to after a bad day is nice and a massage after a hard workout will feel good.  but the massage isn’t going to get you in shape.  that you have to do on your own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>which leads to the second topic, individual freedom.  the personification of it has come in various times but is most prevalent as the Cowboy of the American West.  the really interesting thing would be to compare the two.  when in history has companionship been valued and when has individuality been valued and is there any correlaries.  i don’t know what the answer to that question would be.  by no means am i a historian, yet if i had lots of time and resources and maybe that phone booth from Bill and Ted’s then i think that it would be interesting to find out some of the things that i’ve posed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>or not.  have a good time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>~ # ~&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2004/2004-10-08-274/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>casey@caseykuhlman.com (Casey Kuhlman)</author><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/muniments/2004/2004-10-08-274/</guid><description>&lt;p>tonight’s thematique du jour is loneliness for two reasons.  firstly because i think that i’m essentially a completely lonely person, even when surrounded by people.  secondly, and more presently, because i watched parts (most) of about schmidt.  that movie is basically a film students study in the emotion.  at least that is my take on the piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and so now, as the digital cable electronic channel blares extremely quietly i will discourse on the subject.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i think that america, as a culture has a very interesting relationship with the emotion.  most of us came as emigrants from cultures that were much more communal than this one is.  that is the background and the source of the &amp;ldquo;loathing&amp;rdquo; of loneliness and the neccessity of companionship and belonging. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>there is a flip to this, however.  those that had the balls (give or take for the women readers) to come over here were essentially either independent loners who were wired for self-sufficiency or they were already attached.  but both arenas maintained a romantic fascination with the &amp;ldquo;lone cowboy of the american west&amp;rdquo; or the many iterations that have followed in various forms, but all basically revolving around the same themes of:  choosing to be alone, not having to be, survivalist under duress, and blah blah blah.  mostly its macho shit and i wonder what a female’s perspective on the subject would be. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>that is hard to achieve b/c most of the women’s opinions whom i respect rarely find themselves unattached.  except for one…..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and there is the completely unavoidable topic and rhetorically answerable question that was posed at the beginning of this horribly not-eloquent speech.  am i lonely?  gasp.  mutter amongst yourselves.  is he really not so self-sufficient as he always tells others that he is?  how could it be?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>yeah, its true you fuckers.  i’m stuck in the fucking desert sleeping on a fucking couch and every fucking day is the same.  i mean we’re getting tons of work done, and it is valuable and rewarding shit, but other than to jack or his two wonderfully sweet girls i say like seven words to people.  shit.  what the hell?  i hate the fucking desert.  but what are you gonna do.  part of me wants to be the starving artist who thinks that success will taste that much sweeter when achieved, but there is an equally large part of me that is saying:  flee, we’ll go somewhere and make some money and find the partner in crime that we’ve only had at fleeting moments in my life.  often for a weekend at the time and rarely longer glimpsed then that, at least not since college.  hell, that was five years ago. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>but then i say, stop being a martyr you drunk fuck and just plod on with your life.  it isn’t like i’m going to be here forever.  soon enough we should have some sort of feedback on shooter which will be my initial gauge as to whether my desired career will really pan out or not.  the second, and frankly more important, gauge will come soon thereafter when we go to jefe with the proposal for the second manuscript.  the one for the first novel.  jack remains steadfast in his outward confidence regarding the project.  i’m not so much.  i like it and i think we’ll produce a quality product, but that doesn’t mean jack shit in the big scheme of things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>there is this rising question, however, that do i need to have THIS novel to succeed?  with the money that i got from shooter, could i finance a MFA degree, learn some new shit and venture further with my own shit.  it is a hard row to plod, much harder than getting my JD and the gaurantee that would come with that career choice.  all that is just conjecture, frankly. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>i’m committed to this project until it becomes a complete non-player.  and then we’ll have to reevaluate.  until that point i’m stuck trying to produce the best project that i can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>crystal method is on the channel now.  it was the first electronic concert i ever went to, with first)luv after we were broken up at the house of bluz in chi-town, home of the fucked up cubbies…..it was a great show.  my favorite song off the album is on here:  track four…..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>late’s all.  have a good weekend.  hopefully i’ll have some more movement on my career yaddy yadda after the weekend.  maybe i just need to get away and do something physical like climb a fucking mountain.  what’s wrong with me?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>my link of the day idea has fizzled as i knew it would.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>not a fucking thing!  i worked the entire weekend and when i wasn’t arguing over sentence structure or the connotations of one word versus another and the stylistic derivations of this character’s &amp;ldquo;written pattern of speech&amp;rdquo; versus anothers or some other idiotic equivalent i was curled on my corner of jack’s comfy couch staring blankly at some television that was either a movie or sports or the food network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the food network has been fascinating me again and i have no idea why.  i don’t even like many of the personalities of the cultish-pseudo-celebrities on there.  but i guess i like what i learn there more than i would like if i was watching animal planet, discovery or the travel channel.  if i see one more thing on the guide about the fucking secrets of vegas i’ll puke.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i have done absolutely zilch to enliven my life or extend the powers of my brain beyond this room.  but tomorrow as my internally imposed deadline to stop the duldrums that are still lingering over marinegurl quasi-dumping me again, and without a viable reason, again.  i had orginally set the date because i thought that was when i was going to start with the new job.  now i know that isn’t going to happen and maybe that is for the best.  there is much work to be done and this way i’ll have time to do that. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>as long as i stop waiting for something to happen and just embrace the current status of my existence i think that much of my current disillusionment with the entire world and, oh by the way, the fucking desert of my present world will melt.  that and making my ass pay for all the sitting around and eating chocolate i’ve been doing! &lt;/p>
&lt;p>got sucked into a war novel that is pretty good.  WEB Griffin.  he can write dialogue ok, but i have yet to even see how he writes action.  he lacks color and i don’t he writes so little outside of the characters that i’m not sure i can fully embrace his style, but i understand what he’s trying to do.  it has been important to jack that i read him because i think it is the book that jack is envisioning us writing.  it seems a bit weak to me on many points where we are strong, mainly the personal touches and feels of what is going on.  what does a trigger feel like on your finger, what does your eye actually do when its behind a scope.  how do you make decisions, what factors do you consider, what factors enter your mind but not the decision making process.  that is all well and good, but now we have to go out there and actually do it! &lt;/p>

&lt;p>why do people always lie when answering the question:  how are you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>news of the day:  jimmy swaggart told some people that if a guy ever looked at him weird he’d kill them.  reminds me of when i was drunk in LA soon after the war and i told these chick’s i’d &amp;ldquo;fucking kill them.&amp;rdquo;  i don’t even, to this day, have a clue what set me off. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>my current consumption rate is equalling out at about a bottle and a third of wine a night.  that’s a lot of grapes.  but, nevertheless, we’re getting some good work done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>no final answer on the USMC job yet.  homeboy that is in charge of setting things up for me is pissing me off becuase I called his ass on tuesday and still haven’t heard back from him, that’s two days worth of return phone call time.  maybe he’s on leave….&lt;/p>
&lt;p>heard back a tiny bit on SHOOTER today, from the assistant editor and he liked it a lot.  we’ll see though in another week or so when the actual editor gives it a read.  just want to get it done so we can move on to other projects mentally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>guess that’s it!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>any, i gave her the low down on marinegurl and what the hell was up/happened with regards to her.  also broke down some other stuff for her. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>saturday i went to getty.  will write more about that later.  while down there glitterbrain told me about this sight.  figured i’d try it out.  more later tonight, good football game one now.&lt;/p>
