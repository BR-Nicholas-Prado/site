summary: today during my lunch i decided to watch some bubble gum, so i flipped using
  my ever so handy quatro-surf buttons on my remote control to the preprogrammed (so
  you don’t even have to remember the channel number, as a side note in what context
  are we now required to remember ANY number….I cannot think of such a context myself,
  my cell contains phone numbers, my car contains addresses, my tv remote contains
  my favorite channels, shit what else is there to life?  the study of ancient bath
  techniques and rub downs as a greecian mating ritual/alpha male dominance performance….besides
  that one.) channel for MTV.  ahhh, laguna beach usually makes me cough, curse and
  flip back to VH1, OLN HGN or BET but that wasn’t the case today as the only quote
  i heard was, 'i’m like so totally stoked we’re going up to mammoth.'  well this
  could be interesting.

it wasn’t.  however it did remind me of EVERYTHING i loved and hated about that place at the same time.  they were intertwined like those two icky snakes in the hypocritic oath thingy.  i’m glad we get scales instead of snakes.  HURRAY FOR LAW.  

i other news this has been a fairly slow week and i took time out to golf today with e.  now this must have been the first time i’ve golfed in…..oh….i don’t know…..five years.  give or take a couple of days.  nevertheless it has been a long time.  (intended to put something creative in there but the wording just couldn’t work smoothly.)  i’m conflicted on golf.  on the one hand you have to get outside any way you can, and at least you are walking around some grassy knoll.  but on the other hand it has such middle class, no life having, dockers wearing, wife apathetic-y, horrible connotations.  and such hauty tauty i’m too good for you so i keep you outside the gates to my countryclub, you swine connotations.  i don’t know.  but i did it.  and some balls flew and some balls dribbled.  

this weekend i hope to get away for a little walk in the woods.  have driven something like 100 miles in the past 4 weeks since school has started.  am i still me?  need to get away from this fucking city.  need to drive, need to wall, need to see trees and waterfalls and rocks and birds and maybe some babboon ass.  do they sell that in mass quantities?

well, i’ve gotten through another post successfully and by success i’m measuring it in terms of a complete lack of lawyering terms and references.  will i ever stop analyzing myself and everything around me on at least two levels?  shit man just live your life.  really all is well, am in a good mood tonight.  we’ll see if i still have a back when i wake up tomorrow.
