summary: well.  i’m on 36 straight hours.  i think.  i have lost all cognitive and

well.  i’m on 36 straight hours.  i think.  i have lost all cognitive and reasoning powers.  my back is about to explode.  i need to dumpster dive like 40 cubic feet of trash into random dumpsters that do not belong to me with the hopes that their cameras don’t see me.  

it is hot.  i’m a sweaty behemoth when i’m not in starbucks finding out that a party to go to is too far to walk and i’m gonna register about a .23 on smoky’s breathalizers he got mail order (his first purchase from eBay).  and i haven’t had a single drink.  am just drunk tired.  but the place looks good.  it is coming along.

lots of errands tomorrow.  then  plan on spending monday/tuesday just on my computer finishing everything up.  comcast will grace me with their presence on monday, so cam can stop being mad at me for patronizing his nemisous. (i know that isn’t how you spell that word, but i also know i’m an idiot.
