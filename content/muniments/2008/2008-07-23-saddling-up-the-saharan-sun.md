title: Saddling up the Saharan Sun

[![Solar460x276][2]][2]  
[This ][2]is good news, and something that I’ve been thinking about for a while.  The Europeans want to build gigantic solar power stations in the Sahara and pipe the electricity up via high capacity transmission lines under the Med to the European grid system.

Although I have to laud this idea, I have two problems/concerns with this.  First, the centralization of the power grid is something that I have philosophical problems with.  All though economies of scale are certainly at work, there are problems when you have fewer nodes in the system.  Also if the plan only calls for a limited amount of transmission lines under the Med then there could be problems centralizing that.  A few depth charges could take out all of Europe’s power, or less nefariously, any technical problems with the transmission lines could have drastic effects throughout an entire region that is vital to the world economy.  I would like this much better if we could figure out a way to transfer the energy physically, by storing it at the solar sight in some way and then shipping it to Europe for energy release onto the grid system.  Although I have no idea if this is scientifically feasible or if the energy losses in the storage and release with the additional energy transfer (solar to “chemical” to electricity rather than solar to electricity) would make it counterproductive, it seems that if that technology could be designed than freeing the grid up around the world would be much, much easier.  My other problem with this is that there is no commitment to enhancing the infrastructure of the African grid system.  The lines could just as easily be run south.  In fact they could be run south easier in many cases (as long as you could get the authority from the sovereigns along the way) as it is overland rather than undersea.  So here the Euros are gripping and moaning about how the Africans have no power and in typical post-imperial fashion are perfectly willing to invest massive amounts of dollars in needed infrastructure improvements but only to the extent that they are able to extract the sunlight for their benefit.  

Come ON!  I hope that the pan-Africanists in the North African region will prevail upon the Europeans that if they do grant them the rights to build such a system that they also make commitments to running power lines south.  Yes, I understand that you cannot easily tap into the African grid system (as such a thing does not exist), but if we are going to be tied into grids then this would be an important first step in that direction.  If the Euro’s can make a commitment to building the structures and then provide enough electricity for Africa as well, with the responsibilities on the African nations to come to an agreement on building the transmission lines and some other decentralized nodes to support the system, then I am 100% on board.
