summary: So, if you like the new commercials for Air Jordan’s, I mean [Mac Air ][1]then
  you likely have wondered who the hell is singing that song and why does it make
  me so happy.  Well the answer is [Yael Naim][2] to the first question, the song
  is New Soul.  Apparently she is French, cause the rest of her self-titled album
  is in French, and there is a song titled Paris.  The answer to the second question,
  at least for me, is that it makes me want to go to happy things.  It begins an entire
  stream of day dreaming which inevitably ends somewhere happy.  Not sure what your
  answer will be.  Her video for the song is below.
