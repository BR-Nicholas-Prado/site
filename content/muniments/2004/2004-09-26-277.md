summary: just back from the getty for the afternoon.  went down the hill to my friend’s
  house for the first night.  actually was one of my ex’s.  she’s fairly intense,
  and likes it that way so she plays it up.  we drank wine on her porch while i sweated
  in my jeans and too long of sleeve shirt because its been cold up here and my dumb
  ass was relishing the cold enough that i dressed for it when i shouldn’t have.

just back from the getty for the afternoon.  went down the hill to my friend’s house for the first night.  actually was one of my ex’s.  she’s fairly intense, and likes it that way so she plays it up.  we drank wine on her porch while i sweated in my jeans and too long of sleeve shirt because its been cold up here and my dumb ass was relishing the cold enough that i dressed for it when i shouldn’t have.  

any, i gave her the low down on marinegurl and what the hell was up/happened with regards to her.  also broke down some other stuff for her.  

saturday i went to getty.  will write more about that later.  while down there glitterbrain told me about this sight.  figured i’d try it out.  more later tonight, good football game one now.
