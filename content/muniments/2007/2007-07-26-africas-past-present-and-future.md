Moeletsi Mbeki gave the [keynote speech][1] *at the Second Conference of the European Association of Centers of African Studies*.  

 [1]: http://allafrica.com/stories/200707250737.html?page=2

This speech is amazing, one of my favorite paragraphs:

> Africa’s challenge today is that while the era of dictatorship has  
> apparently come to an end, African countries do not as yet have  
> indigenous institutions and leaders that promote cooperation among the  
> citizens. Developing such institutions is a difficult and costly  
> business that takes a long time. It is made even more complex by the  
> fact that firstly, the re-democratisation of African countries from the  
> mid 1990s was brought about to a significant extent by interventions of  
> Western donors rather than primarily by pro-democracy actions of  
> African organisations or parties. The main exceptions which prove the  
> rule being Uganda and Rwanda, and possibly Nigeria.

Another of my favorites, and how he opens the speech:

> The world has done just about everything it could do to help Africa to  
> develop but has very little positive results to show for its efforts.  
> While most of the world, especially Asia, is forging ahead in the  
> development stakes, Africa is marking time at best, and marching  
> backwards in some instances.

ok back to proofreading.
