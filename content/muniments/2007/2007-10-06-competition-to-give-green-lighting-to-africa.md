The world bank is launching a competition to figure out how to light africa with  something other than little kerosene lamps.  They will choose 10 to 20 of the competition participants and give them something like $200k to pursue their plans further.  Not sure what will happen after that, but hopefully something.

The lamps were serene in their simplistic beauty.  You would turn a corner in Freetown and see the flicker of small kerosene lamps lighting up the rows of kiosks of people selling biscuits and fruit and cigarettes.  But the lamps also broke your heart because you knew that that was the only source of light besides the sun that these people had.  Meanwhile Westereners are going blind under the force of our neon.

Another heartbreaking antidote is that sometimes you would see kids outside right on the narrow streets doing their homework because the lights from the passing cars were the only way they could get something.

If the WB can figure out how to provide cheap lighting that is off the grid (or on a very local grid) that would be fantastic.  But the big if is who is going to finance this.  There are 250 M people here spread over much of a continent…the problems are so vast i sometimes get vertigo when i start to ponder them.  But one bite at a time, maybe the elephant will get eaten….maybe.
