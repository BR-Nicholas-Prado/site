title: Salone votes (again) today

I’m very nervous, but hopeful.  It is now 1830 in Freetown/Salone and BBC has not (yet) reported of any violence.  This isn’t terribly surprising to me.  I think if violence gets propagated it will be by whoever loses this run-off, which will not be known for a while.

BBC also has a heart-breaking [photojournalistic piece][3] about Kroo Bay slum.  I used to look out over Kroo Bay slum.  I would stand out on my balcony and look out over beautiful Freetwon and watch the sunrise in the mornings, cup of coffee or tea in hand and then look down at the bay.  I could see the vast stretches of rubbish and I would just shake my head.  There simply isn’t any place to put all that trash.

The sign on the very last picture is at the "top" of Kroo Bay slum and at the "bottom" of my street, King Street.  I used to [walk/drive][4] (after starting dating Highlands and her car) past that sign a couple of times a day.  It is nice to see the Krio again.  I really, really miss Africa in general, Salone in specific.  How soon can I get back?  Highlands gets to go back for a month, she leaves on monday….."LUCKY."
