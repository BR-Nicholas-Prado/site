title: Put this one in your toolkit
---

[![Captainmorgan2][2]][2]  
I remember one time when Evergreen and I were in the Marine Corps.  He was so tired and it was so dark outside that he heated up a bag of peanut butter to put in his cheese ravioli bag of treats.  It was so disgusting that he had to go hungry or eat it, considering the circumstances (we were on one meal a day for the exercise and all exhausted and constantly hungry) he ate it, but I will always remember the look on his face when he turned to me and said in his Texas draw, "Casey, put this one in your toolkit, always check if the bag is peanut butter or cheese cause if you get this one wrong it’ll costya."  The story is mainly funny to me because of the look of utter destituteness that was on Evergreen’s face when he took that first bite and embarked on the slow realization of what had happened to him, and the realization was slow because of how absolutely exhausted and hungry we all were after a long night of patrolling or whatever we had been doing all we wanted to do was sit down and have a bit of a meal before we started the next day (all this happened just before dawn) of the same grueling stuff.

So now, I give you all one.  Never freeze the European Captain, because unlike American Captain, it freezes.  Not really sure why, but it does.  I am neither hungry, nor thirsty, nor exhausted, nor destitute like Evergreen was in that story, so maybe this isn’t terrible funny, but it IS informative and gives me an excuse to pose a picture of the good Captain.
