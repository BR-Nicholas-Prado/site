title: Brits Should Boycott the Gambia
---

[![_39310613_gambia_jammeh203jpg1][2]][2]  
I am a big supporter of The Gambia for somehow convincing everyone to include the "The" in their name.  They also (apparently) have nice typical West African beaches.

However there are some messed up things going on there.  For one it is one of the most repressive dictatorships in West Africa.  For another their sex worker industry is patronized by old, dirty people who apparently strut around would lithe young Africans for a weekend at the time and then disappear.  Lastly, the tourist areas are completely shut off from the people. The dictator, to ensure his tourism revenue, does not allow the normal populace go near the tourist areas.  IT IS THEIR F’ING COUNTRY….makes me mad.

Now [they’re accusing AI people of spying][2].  That isn’t the way to make friends…especially with Britian who sends you most of your tourism revenue.
