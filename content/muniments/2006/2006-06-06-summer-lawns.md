so i have many reviews and things upon which to comment.  however, those will have to wait until another time.  

for now i wanted to tell you about a fantastic new opportunity for your and your loved ones.  i’m not talking about the pyramid scheme that i’m deeply involved in, although i would love to talk to YOU about that sometime.  maybe we can get a drink, i don’t know you, but i know you’d like to hear what i have to say.

summer lawns.  they are a band.  do it.  juff buckley lyrics and voice meets lyrical, well-instrumented music.  it is worth it.  start with the [KEXP Live Podcast][1] especially the second (or third) song, "i’ll drive, you can sleep through the night."  It begins at 9:20 or so on the podcast.  i lost my shit, it slowly ran down my leg as i was walking home from the bus station with my new headphones on, i turned it up to the loudest my iPod could go.  the sweat ran off as the sun, unimpeded by clouds beat my face.  too many driving nights, too many late night coffee’s, hot dogs, nachos, too many times pushing to meet a deadline of a lover awakening or a super bowl party or a father who is anxious to see me for the first time after a way.  driving is what i do.  you all know that.  it is one of the assorted reasons that makes me a sucka for a theme spun upon the basis of travelling in a car.
