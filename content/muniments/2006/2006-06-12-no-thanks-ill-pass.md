this weekend i almost became a marine….again.  

a friend that i have known forever came down from ft worth to visit for the night.  we were talking about him going back to the sandbox for seven months.  he is going with a civil affairs group that will be doing civil/military liasoning, straight civil affairs (government establishment, police coordination, building schools, making sure there is power and water, helping USAID distribute the moneys for aid, ensuring people get paid, etc.).  

this seemed fortuitous to me.  ever since i’ve made my decision to hone in my career choice and stop browsing the shelves at the Walmart SuperCenter, instead going to the little boutique in the strip mall, the focus is now where it was when i came to law school.  however the decision is pretty tentative.  it is scary in that it will be hard to get into this world from my little nashville school.  it will be hard to network my way into a job anyway.  it is also scary in that i am not gauranteed anything as far as cash is concerned.  

but then this news that the_comedian was tossing my way about his job and how short-staffed they were seemed like the fortiuty.  if i took that job: (1)  i would make BANK–something like $55k tax free.  that means my debts would be paid off, my car would also be paid off and i could relax on the finances since vandy will assist with my student loans if i make under a certain threshhold (which is likely). (2) i would learn ARABIC.  this is key as a resume point, as lack of language skills is currently the biggest hold in the thing that would keep me from doing what i wanted to do.  (3) i would be able to NETWORK.  going to iraq again would let me meet lots of people who are in USAID who may be able to help my long-term career prospects, but also it would be like a neon sign on my resume that i’m not scared (the first time i went aside) of hostile places, that i can function in amorphous situations and it would lend credibility when i say this is what i want to do.

those three positives seemed infallible to me for much of the weekend, which, admittedly, was spent in a drunken haze.  after the_comedian left i started to really think.  i smoked about 8900 cigarettes this weekend just to clear the air of my mind and try to focus on the negatives.

then i called activist and miami to run this by them.  to put it mildly they were not anxious to encourage me.  there is the obvious security risk.  but that is negligible to me.  miami told me that there would be no way she could forgive herself if i was to not make it and if she did anything to encourage me to return. 

after talking to them and balancing out the momentum from having the_comedian pitch it to me i really thought long and hard about it.  there are two things that are going to stop me from taking the job.  two arguments that sold the passing.

(1) although arabic would look great on my resume in that it is a high need language by most everyone, if i put that on my resume and an organization hires me based upon that then i may be pigeonholed into that region as my specialty region.  now i know that this is how these things work, and i know that i’m going to have to narrow my focus down to one region soon in order to really focus my career goals.  i’m not ready to say that the arabic region is where i want to focus.  i’m not ready to say that it is not either.  the unfortunate thing is that the country within the region that is most fascinating is also the most closed off: iran.  and speaking arabic isn’t going to go very far in a farsi speaking country anyway.  the persian intellectual tradition is fascinating, but i’m not really anxious to get into the arabic cultural tradition.  that isn’t a completely true statement.  what i mean is that i’m not ready to focus on that area at the cost of all others in the developing world.  so there is the pigeonholing argument.

(2) is the dangerous aspect of the job.  now i’m not being a pansy here.  maybe i am, but i don’t think that i am.  this is the thing if i was going to go back with an infantry unit to do infantry stuff i would be surrounded by warriors.  doing this job i’ll be stationed in a small to medium sized town (i’m thinking this is the scenario) working with the locals.  probably staying in the police station or commuting from a nearby base.  but i would only be surrounded by my small team of marines and we would be out there in al anbar province doing it.  the thing that makes this more dangerous than just normal infantry patroling is that you are the symbol to that town of the american occupation.  so if there is anyone disillusioned with the american presence in the country for the many reasons that i can think of to be upset with it, you are their target.  no matter how much good you do if something bad happens you are going to get blamed, you will become the target.  this really crescendoes the danger above the normal level for these teams.  although the security concern was a concern to come later it is also extremely salient.

and then was the final kicker above the two things that had siezed the momentum:  i just can’t put my family and friends through that again.  it isn’t fair.  it is too selfish.  just like the story i wrote: you don’t really have time or the capacity to get scared, but they are freaked out everytime the phone rings or a knock on the door comes for the entire time i’m gone.  if i don’t HAVE to go then i really can’t do that to them again.  i think the stress really would send mamo to her grave.  

so in the end i passed on the deal, no matter how good of a career move it would have been long term.  the skills and networking and money that i would have gotten by taking the job were simply not enough to overcome the pigeonholing, the focusing of the danger and the stress upon my family and friends.
