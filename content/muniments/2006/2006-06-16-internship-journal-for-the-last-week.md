the following is my excerpt from my last journal entry, which i had to submit to my faculty advisor:

 this week  
the claim preclusion opinion that i drafted, and was circulated, was  
returned. the comments and feedback were  
interesting and varied greatly from the judge who is on the campaign trail  
right now who signed off without a single pen change to the judge who  
“couldn’t” comment because there was “too much work” to be done on it (she also  
did not make a single pen change) to actually helpful comments on some of the  
reworking of the issues. it made me  
think of something a guy said to me last summer. last summer i was a panelist on the aspen  
summer words writer’s festival and after we finished the panel i was at the bar  
having a drink with one of the other panelists who was a magazine writer. we were talking about editing and he told me  
something that stuck. he said “i think  
of the editing process as a negotiation between the editor and myself.” that seems an incredibly apt metaphor here  
where all the judges either have to sign off on the opinion or draft a new  
opinion (which, of course, they are not jumping at the opportunity to do since  
they each have their own caseload of opinions to write). i was laughing about that comment to today as  
my supervising staff attorney was putting her little side comments on whether  
or not i should incorporate wordings and phrasings from a particular  
judge. it was evident who had the  
negotiating power among them and who did not. “she is a great editor since she was a former english teacher.” [read, incorporate her changes word for  
word.] “she just rewrote it the way she  
would have originally wrote it were she working on the opinion.” [read, incorporate whatever you think is  
valid and discard the rest.] “now this  
is incredibly unhelpful.” [read, don’t  
even bother to look through it.] 

when we were going over the changes  
that she actually wanted me to incorporate she made a comment that i thought  
was incredibly helpful thing for me to keep in mind. it went something like this: “you know, you being a published author you  
obviously brought with you a certain style for story telling. but when you write it is like you keep  
forgetting that you are writing a legal document until the last second you  
throw in a legal turn of phrase. it is  
really jarring.” i pressed her on the  
subject as i was really interested in this observation, mainly because i think  
she is right. i asked her to clarify  
whether she meant that it was bad that i was writing in a “story-telling way”  
or was it bad that i was throwing in legal phrasings or was it bad that my  
legal phrasings seemed tacked on and there was no smooth transition between the  
two styles. she said that the hardest  
thing was the jarring nature and that i need to make the transitions smoother  
and stick in one “voice” or “style” for a complete section of a document and  
then if i need to change the voice or style to make the transitions smoother or  
at least at the beginning of a paragraph. i asked her to show me examples and she did. mainly what she was pinpointing were places  
where my writing style was colloquial and simple but instead of using a  
colloquial or simple word i would throw in legalese. her observation was dead on as i started to  
review some stuff i do that. so it is  
something for me to work on.

but i was thinking today about why  
and/or whether there should be a noticeable difference between the two writing  
styles. i mean, there obviously is a  
tangible difference between the two, if there were not then you would have one  
job instead of two. i guess much of it  
is historical/cultural. the profession  
developed with some sort of a need to prove itself and one of the ways that i  
think the legal profession justified its existence and filtered out those who  
would gain entry to its ranks was by adopting new words, forms of speech and  
phrasings. the legal community seems to  
pride itself on these distinguishing characteristics. “it is what separates us from the normal  
people,” or something to that effect. but, frankly, i think that that is crap. if there is an easier way to say something that does not require you  
shoehorning your writing into a certain form why should you have to rearrange  
your writing to a form that outside the legal community most people would think  
is ineffective and unappealing stylistically just because “it is what judges  
and senior partners expect.” (i  
reflected on the quote that chicago manual style likes by churchill that is an  
incredibly hard to read sentence where he was making the point that often times  
it is just easier to end a sentence with a preposition.) i was thinking about that for a bit and then  
it occurred to me that that is no different than anything else. all this boils down to is knowing your  
audience, an elementary tenant of writing. 

my judge has told me in the past  
that he is a very story oriented writer. he knows that he is in the majority, but still thinks that it is ok to  
put a little bit of personality into your opinions. as such he let me go with the opinion in my  
voice that (stylistically at least) fits with his philosophy on legal  
writing. a litigant or staffer that  
knows that can be “looser” with his or her writing style when they present  
something to him. other judges here at  
this court are much more stylistically formal and they require more formal  
reasoning and style out of the written documents they receive. 

i guess it simplifies to there  
isn’t so much of a conflict between the two writing styles as there is between  
the audiences. if i had never been  
enabled by my judge to “tell a story, write this opinion like you’re writing it  
to your mom,” then i never would have had a conflict. i would have just writing very impersonal and  
formal. the staff attorney is a more  
formalist person and writer, but she knew that my style is more similar to the  
judge’s than it is to hers and she was ok with that. i realized later that what she was really  
saying to me is to stick with one thing and be brave enough to continue  
that. just because i’m writing a legal  
document doesn’t necessitate that i must insert legal phrasings just to lend  
them authority. i guess she was saying  
that if your argument and reasoning is solid (which most seemed to think that  
it was) then you don’t need to bolster it with words and phrasings that  
obviously do not fit with the rest of your document.
