in case you had not heard or i have been negligent in letting you know, i will be heading to sierra leone next semester to work with [the special court for sierra leone][1].  

 [1]: http://www.sc-sl.org/

it looks like i’ll be working on either pre-trial stuff, trial work (assisting not arguing, obviously) or post-trial appellate level work.  at this point we are not sure and it will depend upon the dynamics of the situation.

i will be getting credit for my work there so there are no problems with my ability to graduate on time, and most importantly I’M GOING TO SIERRA LEONE.  i’ll be abroad from january until june.  i’m not sure what will be happening for the summer, we’ll just have to see.

what does the court do:

>   
>         The Special Court for Sierra  
>         Leone was set up jointly by the Government of Sierra Leone and the  
>         United Nations. It is mandated to try those who bear the greatest  
>         responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law  
>         and Sierra Leonean law committed in the territory of Sierra Leone since  
>         30 November 1996.  
>         
> 
> Currently,  
> eleven persons associated with all three of the country’s former  
> warring factions stand indicted by the Special Court. They are charged  
> with war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations  
> of international humanitarian law. Specifically, the charges include  
> murder, rape, extermination, acts of terror, enslavement, looting and  
> burning, sexual slavery, conscription of children into an armed force,  
> and attacks on United Nations peacekeepers and humanitarian workers,  
> among others. Indictments against two other persons were withdrawn in  
> December 2003 due to the deaths of the accused.

that is what they do.  needless to say, i’m quite stoked about the opportunity to make a god damn difference.
