title: Institutional Allocation as between International Organizations

I created the following document in order to get some thoughts straight for a presentation I have tomorrow.  It is longer than my presentation will take, and much of it may be out of view for some of you, but I’m putting it up here b/c I think it is pretty good encapsulation of many of the things I’ve learned this semester.  It is not cited.  If you think I need to cite in a blog, go fuck yourself.  

Wow, Dave, Three posts from me in one day….aren’t you happy?

The cases we were assigned raise an interesting question of  
institutional allocation. The case  
addresses unilateral trade sanctions by one of the WTO member States. That said, there is nothing stopping the WTO  
from expanding that ruling to include multilateral trade sanctions that could  
be imposed by a COP to an environmental treaty. If that expansion were to happen then would all subsequent and earlier  
environmental treaties be subject to the provisions of the WTO if it wanted to  
adopt a trade sanction as an enforcement mechanism? Could existing environmental treaties that  
include other enforcement mechanisms (carbon caps and trading for example) be  
construed as dampening effects upon trade and market development and  
correlatively must they then pass a WTO test? 

 If the answers to these questions were always yes that would  
turn the WTO into the defacto authorization body for all  
environmental/labor/human rights etc. treaties. That cannot be the case. The  
authorizing bodies for all treaties are states that negotiate and ratify and  
enforce the treaties. Thus we must ask  
how to allocate the power as between institutions. For the purposes of this presentation we will  
be examining the WTO as one institution and the COP of an environmental treaty  
(such as an RFMO) as the competing institution. 

 There are two questions that must be asked when looking to  
how to allocate power as between international institutions. (1) What is the power of the States party to  
the institution as well as the institution itself to prescribe rules and standards  
governing the subject matter of the treaty? This is known in the State context  
as *prescriptive jurisdiction*. (2) What is the power of the States party to the institution as well as the  
institution itself to adjudicate interpretive or substantive disputes that  
arise in the course of implementation and execution of the treaty? This is known as *adjudicatory jurisdiction*. When you look at competing institutions you are basically asking: how do  
we allocate the prescriptive and adjudicatory jurisdiction as between them? 

 The institutional allocation issue is not unique to int’l  
law.  However the int’l law application  
of the issue raises unique questions. Questions  
of institutional allocation are familiar to American lawyers in the contexts of  
administrative law (how much should Congress legislate and how much should it  
leave to the administrative agencies) as well as federalism. Int’l law brings unique questions to the  
issue. The two main questions come from:  
complete, uniform and absolute sovereignty as well as from the equal footing of  
treaties. 

 All treaties may not be created equal, but there is no  
hierarchy of treaties. The UN Charter  
may be the granddaddy of treaties, but outside that there is very little hierarchical  
rules. Certainly there is no standard  
regime for distributing between treaties. There are three applicable rules of construction from the Vienna  
Convention on the Laws of treaties that are applicable. They are all found in Article 30. (1) Lex Specialis could trump lex generalis  
if the later treaty contains greater detail and if it regulates the same  
subject matter as an earlier treaty. This is only applicable if all relevant States are parties to both treaties. (2) When all applicable States are parties to  
the subsequent treaty the later in time rule usually applies. (3) When all applicable States are parties to  
only one treaty, that treaty trumps treaties that not all applicable States are  
parties to. These rules may cut against  
each other in various contexts, but outside of these general rules there are no  
specific rules for conflict of laws and conflict of forum scenarios that arise  
as between int’l treaties.

 Second, states retain the power. It is only in ceding power to an IO that that  
IO gains any power. But all power is  
vested in the individual states. This is  
extremely familiar to American lawyers as a federalism concern. However, it is different in the int’l context  
because there is no absolute inclusion like there is in the 
US

context. This lack of absolute inclusion, or what  
could be termed top-down compulsion, adds a level of complexity to the debate  
when it turns to rights of dissenters as well as the prescriptive jurisdiction. Just because a state may cede some  
prescriptive power to the WTO to set various schedules and rates, that does not  
mean that the state necessarily cedes prescriptive power to that body to  
regulate domestic environmental policy. When  
a State does not like or agree with an action taken by IO, the latter body has  
very little power to force its will on the State. If the State finds it more efficient or less  
costly it can leave the IO or snub its nose at the IO. B/c the ultimate power is vested in the State  
and there is no ability of the IO to force compulsion a State will only comply  
with the will of an IO if it is less costly to do so. These costs come in reputational and  
political as well as in economic forms. The same cannot be true in the 
US

federal system. If GA doesn’t like a decision or a statute of  
the federal government it cannot snub its nose at the federal government and it  
cannot pack its bags. 

 Now that we have identified a few of the unique questions  
that arise when asking institutional allocation questions in the international  
context, let’s apply those to our question. First off, when we ask questions of the allocation of prescriptive  
jurisdiction as between IO’s that will necessarily alter the jurisdiction as  
between states. Some states will have  
much more involvement in one treaty than they will in another. States that have more invested in a given  
treaty will obviously want that treaty body (or IO) to have more prescriptive  
jurisdiction. There are also the questions  
of influence over the subject matter, involvement in the “legislative” process,  
and expertise over the subject matter.  

 This horizontal allocation of jurisdictional power as  
between states becomes especially salient when you look across subject matter  
boundaries. Some societies will  
obviously value a given subject matter more than they may value other subject  
matter (turtles may be more important than money to some). The difference in values placed by each State  
on a given subject matter creates a tension as between different IO’s. Some small coastal states, or states with  
large fishing fleets will have a lot of social investment, as well as capital  
investment, in a RFMO and due to that investment they may wield more influence  
in that IO. They will necessarily want  
to optimize the jurisdictional power of their IO, often at a cost to IO’s that  
regulate a different subject matter where their investments would have paid  
smaller dividends.  Since each State  
retains its sovereignty, it may be able to minimize the costs associated with  
the transference of jurisdictional power as between IO’s by withdrawing from  
the IO where power was drawn from or threatening to withdraw or by taking other  
political tacks. 

 As one commentator has written “the market for transactions  
in prescriptive jurisdiction is not yet very liquid.” This creates a problem if states do not  
efficiently allocate from the start.  Since int’l law is an iterative process that  
allocation can arguably never be efficient from the start, b/c there is no  
start. What is time zero for one IO  
cannot be time zero for another. Even if  
they were to enter force on the same day, the provisions of each treaty are to  
be interpreted in light of the context of the treaty. That context is a fluid thing that includes  
all the events that gave rise to the negotiation of the treaty as well as the  
way the negotiations were handled. Even  
if there was a start point getting the initial allocation of prescriptive  
jurisdiction efficiently allocated may involve a transaction with costs that  
outweigh the benefits in every occasion. The transaction costs are likely to include: negotiating costs,  
differing values and preferences and interests, binding, depth, holdouts,  
reputational costs and political costs. 

 If there is no start point and if there is a very limited  
possibility that states are going to efficiently optimize jurisdictional power,  
then states must allocate jurisdictional power as between IO’s as efficiently  
as possible along the way. This dynamic  
component of the int’l law system can be easily analogized to a market system. But what is the market in prescriptive  
jurisdiction? It is the int’l community  
with a revolving door of relevant actors who have a revolving door of interests  
motivating their actions. Or maybe  
states could cede all powers in a repository that can allocate prescriptive  
jurisdiction as between subject matter or regional IO’s. This centralized authority could bring  
certainty to a system as well as stemming externalities in races to the bottom  
by allocating prescriptive jurisdiction to the IO most likely to have the power  
or influence or wedge that would stem a state’s momentum. This flexibility may be something we  
want. If the int’l community wants a  
State to live up to a certain norm then a central repository could allocate  
prescriptive jurisdiction to an IO where that State has a larger stake than  
influence. The targeted State would then  
find itself in a position where the costs of non-compliance outweigh the  
benefits. 

 Next I want to turn to the adjudicatory jurisdictional  
issues. The world of treaties may look  
to be discreet circles, but basically it represents a web of ven diagrams. This reality necessitates that there are  
going to be many instances where there are competing norms and competing  
interpretations and competing regulatory/policy responses. But there are two distinct questions  
here: choice of law and choice of  
forum. 

 In Art. 20 of the GATT the WTO said that other int’l  
agreements that were entered into as necessary to protect human, animal or  
plant life or heath are exempted from the provisions of the GATT. But that exemption has not been adopted. Indeed as the cases here illustrate, the WTO  
has  put its fingers in many pots. So which norms should trump which? Which treaty should trump which? Which law should trump which? There is clearly no normative reason why the  
provisions of the WTO should trump those of an int’l treaty. Now this is not what the WTO ruled,  
ostensibly, even in its formalistic, far-reaching holding in Shrimp/Turtle  
I. But if the regulations on trade and  
on capture that were adopted by the 
US

had been adopted by a RFMO how  
could the WTO rule that its norms trump those of the RFMO’s? How do we choose when faced with such a  
conflict of law question? Which treaty  
would trump? That treaty which has  
primary coverage over the subject matter? That treaty which recognizes the norms of another treaty? That treaty with the most members  
trumps? That treaty that has the  
strongest enforcement trumps? How we  
integrate an allocate these differing bodies of law is becoming an increasingly  
important subject for int’l lawyers. 

 Lastly, how do we choose the decision maker? Much of the criticism of the WTO in the  
aftermath of these cases comes from their perceived or real bias. Should they be dabbling in environmental  
protection? More importantly if there  
was a buttress, a WEO how would they distribute the decision making as between  
them in hard cases. Would they simply  
negotiate between them? Would it be  
plaintiff’s choice? Would we have to  
codify specific choice of forum rules into all future treaties? Would we establish my customary int’l law  
certain standards of comity between different forums? What would the comity multifactor test look  
like? 

 A solution to all this would be to expand the jurisdiction  
of the ICJ and the ICC or the WTO, etc. to include all international law. This one-stop shopping for litigants could  
prove easy, but is it what the world needs. The difficulties in instituting the ICC are illustrative here. In that instance the ICC was established to  
have subject matter jurisdiction over jus cogens norms — norms that are  
universally condemned. But yet that  
process was long, politically charged and costly on all sides. Its implementation has been far from  
perfect. What happens if the int’l  
community tries to expand a universal forum to adjudicate norms that are not  
nearly as universally condemned. That  
lack of moral impetus will probably be the divisive factor. That and the fact that states retain all of  
their sovereignty.
