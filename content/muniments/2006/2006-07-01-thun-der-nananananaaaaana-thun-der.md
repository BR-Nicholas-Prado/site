[![Hb1sm_1][2]][2]  
last night i went to THIS.  i flashed back to driving to the keys for one of my first times with all the windows down and gb with me.  i was screaming ac/dc at the top of my lungs.  she was laughing her ass off.  

 []: http://www.hellsbelles.info/

this is a lesbian ac/dc cover band.  there is no other way to say this:  they rock fucking hard.  the chick who covers angus spent most of the show in a black bra and the little plaid skirt.  it was hillarious.  they are from seattle.  

my love of ac/dc did not begin at the beginning.  in fact as a youngster i was a bit intimidated by metal and harder music.  i remember mowing the lawn one sunday with my walkman on listening to my namesake doing his countdown and doctor feelgood came on.  it rocked but it did not really give me a good buzz.  i was pretty equivocal about it in general.

then came jon meert.  jon meert was my friend jason’s older brother.  the circular part of this story is that jason lives in seattle currently, but that is neither here nor there.  jon meert was a year older than us, but about five years more physically mature.  i think he had a full chest of hair when jason and i were in seventh grade.  he was a bear of a man when we were growing up.  sometimes those that seem large when you see them years later they suddenly are much smaller.  not jon.  when i saw him two or so years ago he was still the large, hairy man that i remembered.

jon drove his mother’s thunderbird.  not just a thunderbird, it was a fucking firebird with removable panels, t-top, black.  it was sick.  it was loud.  it was dirty.  it was low.  it was fast.  jason and i loved making jon (who was sixteen at the time and working at blimpie’s in naples) drive us to the movies or to the beach so we could ride in that fucker.  me, being the late bloomer, was pretty small and didn’t mind riding in the back, as long as jon drove that stick shift fucking car fast with the panels off so my hair can flow.

that was the summer when i fell in love with rock n roll.  there was something about that car that legitimized GNR, metallica and ac/dc in a way that i had not been able to comprehend before.  there was something incomplete in my picture of rock n roll before jon and his firebird showed me what i means to rock.

so jon meert.  for those about to rock.  i salute you.

ps-the lead singer was probably the sexiest lesbian i’ve ever seen.  too bad her DSL’s are going to waste.
