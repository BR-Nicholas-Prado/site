well, life has been crazy.  we’ve been working like fiends.  i saw the sun rise on four straight mornings.  three because of work, one because of partying.  it has been a weird couple of nights, for a lot of reasons.  

but now i’ve gotten a break.  yesterday i wrote all afternoon at my coffeeshop, then did yoga for the first time in three alcohol and smoke laden days, then ate dinner with two lady-friends then came home to fall asleep to MTV banalities.  

today i spent much of the time up at the maroon bells, the nation’s most photographed mountain with a couple of friends and one child.  the kid was fucking crazy well behaved.  it restoked my uncle fire.  in case you didn’t know i’ll be an uncle in approximately 7.5 months.  SA-WEET.  then i came  home to type out and make some of the edits that have been pen changed for weeks now.  so finally we have another Wading chapter.  enjoy it if you wanna.  off to stretch my shit out.
