excerpt: the following things happened during my evening hike today:  i was startled
  by a fairly large brown bear when i rounded the corner and there he/she was 15 yards
  from me.  luckily she/he sauntered off.  i gave blood to the mosquito blood bank
  of the roaring fork valley….don’t they know i’ve been given the anthrax and small
  pox vaccinations and cannot give blood for another five years.  i startled a beaver
  and he made a pop sound with his tail and for a while i couldn’t figure out what
  had happened until i saw his dam and his house, which were directly in front of
  me the entire time.

and i almost hit bambi’s mom on the drive home.  eventful, beautiful.

watched school of rock again tonight because i’d been singing led zeppelin to myself most of the hike, when i wasn’t day dreaming.  and face it, we all need our jack black fix from time to time.
