I was skeptical of ole’ Ellen at the beginning.  I’m beginning to come around.  Most people [that I talked to][2] on the streets of Monrovia were huge EJS fans.  I mean massively supportive of [her motherliness][3], [her toughness][4] (she was actually aligned with Taylor at the beginning of the conflict according to [Steven Ellis][5]‘ book), [her statesmanship][6], and [her overall good governance focus][7].

Now the woman known as either Ellen or Ma on the streets of Monrovia has added another thing to her growing CV in the mind of me. She has [joined][8] the [Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative][9] set up by Tony Blair in 2002 which will progress transparency in the extraction of natural resources.  The website says this about EITI:

The links between good governance and the ability of a government to alleviate the poverty in their country are [nearly synonymous][10] and i’m writing a long paper on them right now.  Suffice it for here to say that when countries have good governance not only do they spend what little money they have "well" in the sense that they spend it on things that will help in the short-, medium-, and long-term to alleviate poverty, not only are they traditionally less corrupt, but they also get more money from donors.  these three things usually create a symbiotic causal linkage whereby donors will see exponential returns on their money in the form of poverty reduction.

that is all for now.
