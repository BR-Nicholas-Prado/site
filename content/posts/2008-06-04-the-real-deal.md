[Andrew Sullivan][3] has some phenomenal reactions about Barack’s seeming win up today.  The first is a story that choked me up told by one of Andrew’s [readers][4]:  

> My grandfather, 86 years old and a veteran of WWII, just  
> gave me a call. He was calling all of his grandchildren to let them  
> know what an important night this was in the history of our country. 

> Grandpa drove a truck for over 50 years, and he told the story of  
> how he drove with a team of drivers, 2 white (including him), and 4  
> black. When they stopped at the truck stops, the black drivers had to  
> use seperate restrooms and showers, and had to eat in a small room in  
> the back of the kitchen. Grandpa and his co-driver would eat in the  
> back with the rest of the team, and while they didn’t speak of it at  
> the time, they knew it was wrong yet felt powerless to change it, and  
> believed that it would never change. 

> Tonight, he told me, we have come full-circle. Many people,  
> especially the younger generation who supported Obama, will never fully  
> realize the historical import of what happened tonight. But he wanted  
> his grandchildren to know this story that he had never told us, and it  
> was the second time in my 33 years that I have heard my grandpa cry.

The other is Andrew’s [reaction ][2]to Barack’s speech he gave last night (you), this morning (me):  

> If I needed reassurance that this man is the most formidable force  
> in American politics today, his speech tonight confirmed it. It was  
> shrewd – with an artful positioning on Iraq. It was graceful – with  
> respect for McCain’s service and Clinton’s tenacity. It was brutal – in  
> turning around McCain’s Iraq visit meme to domestic economic woes. It  
> was patriotic – in its evocation of Gettysburg and the Second World  
> War. It was outer-directed: not for Obama the recourse to  
> self-satisfied identity politics of the kind used by the Clintons  
> because they often have nothing else. It was moving. I thought I even  
> saw some suggestions of tears as he remembered his grandmother. It was  
> also rhetorically more powerful than McCain – not by a small amount but  
> by a mile. Put McCain’s speech against Obama’s – and this was a  
> wipe-out. Not a victory. A wipe-out. Rhetorically, they are simply not  
> in the same league. And if the contrast tonight between McCain and  
> Obama holds for the rest of the campaign, McCain is facing a defeat of  
> historic proportions.

> One more thing: with McCain’s and Clinton’s speeches, you could not  
> forget the politics of it. With Obama, you forgot about that at times.  
> You actually lifted your eyes a little and believed a little and hoped  
> a little. 

> Yes, he can. And anyone who under-estimates that will regret it.

I awoke at five this morning and timed it perfectly as he was about to take the stage when I got the TV sorted.  CNN had audio but no visual as the signal was scrambled.  Luckily for me BBC carried the entire thing, except for a vital moment during his wind up at the end where the signal died and I cursed to all hell the Somali desert winds that were impeding my political joy.  

On a related note, the NY Times had this grand photo of the Obamas watching Hillary’s speech.  I think the frustration on Michelle’s face and the stoicism on Barack’s face are more telling than any words I can write.  As I thought more about it I became more and more irate at HRC’s intransigence and utter lack of class.  This night was all about her for her, and a third about her for Obama.  It is over.  She needs to face it and the DNC elites need to ensure that she faces it.  I am frustrated at the apparent spinelessness of the party supremos.  Why are they so scared of Bill’s wrath?  

Although I couldn’t see her comment, I heard Donna Brazille (a superdelegate and CNN commentator) say something akin to, “well, I didn’t support him because he didn’t need me to put him over the top.”  That is utter crap.  You are a middle aged black woman.  Don’t tell me he doesn’t need your support!  The DNC could learn a lot from the discipline of the RNC.  I told Big_Head today when I called because of happiness that the DNC can be maddening with its uber-hippy notions of flaunting of discipline.  Sometimes that is fantastic, but this isn’t one of them.  And, by the way, if I hear one more time that HRC is doing this for her supporters I’m going to stab 48 pencils into the eye of the first person I see.

In any event, the man I came late to support is now the first candidate of color from a major American party.  Hooray!
