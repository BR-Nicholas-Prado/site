excerpt: I meant to post this yesterday but was having technical difficulties.  If
  you haven’t watched MLK’s speech, if you’ve just seen the clips throughout your
  life.  Take a moment, or twelve and watch it here.  It is a magnificent achievement,
  and even if you are not in a position to dedicate your life towards ensuring the
  equalities that Dr. King was fighting for, even if you think you have no ability
  to contribute to a world where 'justice rolls down like water, and righteousness
  like a mighty stream,'  even if you think there is little you can do, just watch
  it as a piece of Great American Art.  And at the end when Dr. King says 'Free at
  last, free at last, thank god almighty we are free at last,' think about some small
  thing that you can do to help.
