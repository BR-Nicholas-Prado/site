[![Xmasto][2]][2]Have been listening to John Denver’s Christmas Album.  Recorded in 1979, John Denver’s Album “A Christmas Together”  
featuring the inchoate inventives of Jim Henson’s LCD flashbacks is officially  
one of the trippiest albums ever recorded and produced in a recording studio.  Check out track 11, it will blow your mind.

Now to some Indictments, some Finals and some Outlining all with Indian Food in my belly.  Ahh, the Playoffs are approaching.
