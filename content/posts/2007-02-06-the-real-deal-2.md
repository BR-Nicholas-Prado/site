[The real deal?][1] is an article that addresses real or percieved gaps in the current debate on climate change.  I agree heartily that there are gaps.

i understand what this article is trying to argue, but i don’t agree. this article cites one israeli scientist that published one paper that may or may not have been peer reviewed and claims that there is a scientific debate. in fact what the IPCC found is that there is a greater than 90% chance that climate change is caused by human factors. the FDA uses a figure something on the order of 20 – 30 % chance that there is a link between a drug and side effect or between a food and harmful effect in order to make policy decisions about whether to approve a drug, take it off the shelves or whatnot. the EPA uses an even lower figure as to the chance of a causal actually exists and whether or not to make policy decisions based upon it. in each of these policy realms where science is invoked it will never be precise. there will always be critics. however what policy makers must do is to set limits and do an economic analysis of the cost and benefits in real monetary terms and in (i would argue) human terms. now if the EPA and FDA make decisions in the presence of a 30% (maximum) probability that there is a causal link that will impact, what are we doing absolutely nothing when there is now a high degree of consensus that the probability of the human-climate change link is three times that high. i understand the argument that if some regulation/legislation were passed then it will have more drastic overall economic consequences to the entire economy rather than the relatively isolated sectoral effects that would be felt when the other, but similar, governmental bodies pass science-based policy measures. however when the probability of the causal link is this high, it seems that we have reached the point that something needs to be done. 

there are various ways that, on its face, this one scientists’ arguments implode on themselves. i will put those aside b/c they are too easy to address. 

i agree that there is a gap in the media’s propoganda machine. but gaps are inevitable. they will exist no matter the issue. the only way to fix that from a policy perspective is transparency (something that cam and I are basing much of our ethos on). there has been, to date, a lack of transparency in the government as to why nothing has been done. because of this lack of governmental/political debate we are left to propoganda from whatever side one must swing on. if inaction is the proper action (which i categorically deny that it is correct here, but in other situations inaction may be more efficient/equitable), then the populace needs to be convinced by the government that failed to act as to why they chose inaction. this is the feedback loop that i think only partially exists.
