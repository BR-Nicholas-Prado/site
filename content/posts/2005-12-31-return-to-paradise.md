this is harder than i really thought that it could be.  my mind is racing with what if’s.  i know that i shouldn’t.  i know what it does to me.  trust me.  i know.  but it is an unstoppable, irrestistable, uncompressible force that is pushing my mind around.  

what if i hadn’t left?

that is the crux of the matter.  i’m back in aspen.  it is winter (obviously) the snow is immaculate, forgiving, soft, just grabby enough, not skiied out.  the people here are the same.  it is weird how many i feel like i know.  when i arrived i walked down the mall at snowmass, weighted by my board for the first time in months.  as i walked i was self-conscious.  i felt like a sell-out.  but nevertheless there i was, walking down the mall with my snowboard.  as i walked i relaxed and started looking at the faces in the crowd.  there were many that i recognized.  a surprising amount.  i started saying hi to a few people.  then more and more that i knew and before i knew it i was satisfied and happy.  dropped my board off and settled in for a long winter’s ride.

the coffee shop is closing and so am i.
