hello.

this weekend was pretty amazingly long.  in a good way i guess.  except for i had a lot of work that could have been done, but i never got around to it.  it is mitigated by the fact that none of it was actually due this weekend, i just wanted to get started on it.  that can happen later i guess.

the weekend basically began on wednesday when we hosted our own welcome aboard party and some friends came over for american game night.  we played catchphrase (the bastard child of taboo and hot potato) and beer pong (the bastard child of many college greecians).  

[![030207_1343][3]][3] thursday we went out to copacabanas (written about earlier).  on friday we heard from a friend that the embassy was having happy hour at atlantic.  atlantic is a large club on right on the beach that is usually the friday night hang out.  we had been there last friday night and it was filled with british military boys (who are here to train the SL military and police and have been for years) and locals.  this night, when we walked in, there were approximately eight people in the entire joint.  all of them were us embassy workers and none of them knew us.  but we saddled up to the table.  after an oddly awkward exchange with some people the ambassador asked my friend and i to sit across the table from him and his wife.

[![040207_1430_2][4]][4] so there we were, rapping with the ambassador and his wife.  they were almost iconic in their precision to my vision of an ambassador and his wife in a poor african country.  smart, insightful, bubbly, a vision of all the good things about our country.  they had met here in sierra leone while in the peace corps in the sixties, fell in love and have been globe trotting together ever since.  we ended our experience at atlantic by grabbing a taxi to paddy’s.  paddy’s is a famous place and the place that is the model for the amalgam of the beach bar ‘profiled’ in the film [blood diamond][4].  the owner of paddy’s has been knighted by the queen of england for, essentially, providing hookers and beer to brit expats and military trainers here throughout the war and reconstruction years.   but apparently none of its ‘famous’ patrons were there on friday nights…*see* *supra.*

[![Imgp1174_2][6]][6] saturday.  what happened?  o yeah.  i slept in.  our housemate fired our caretaker at six in the morning over loud arguing whilst we were trying to sleep.  then i went back to sleep.  after i awoke for real we got called that we had a ride to the market.  we had yet to go.  it is an experience.  tight alleyways filled to the brim with kiosks selling everything that i ever donated to goodwill.  there were tons of pirate dvd’s and cd’s bubbling over with african jams that i’ve gotten to know at the above mentioned venues, brilliant fruits, and very few things worth buying.  the first two pictures i posted are from this market.  i was able to come across a french press and a can opener that actually works.  both purchases make me happy.  haggling for them does not.  i am not wired to haggle.  i like the fact that a price is a price.  i don’t make a good car purchaser or any other purchaser.  it feels just off to me, i feel creepy when i do it.  i’m not sure why.  but i made the purchases.

spent the afternoon rapping with some friends while watching cricket on satelitte tv.  then we had a group that cooked a good italian dinner.  then we went out.  again.  to a party.  again.  afterwards to paddy’s.  again.  the second time tho was fundamentally different.  paddy’s is happening on saturdays.  we arrived home at 4.

again there was drama with our housemates and the help first thing in the morning.  again, i didn’t care.  again, i went back to sleep afterwards.

[![N557965146_57200_4735][7]][7] sunday we went to the beach.  it was the second beach we had gone to.  at this one there was a haven set back from the beach and separated from the beach by a fordable river.  it was shady and delicious.  you can see the patio where we ate.  i had some pasta with a cream sauce and mushrooms, then i had ice cream, then i had coffee.  then i felt like a colonialist.
