I have been fascinated by disarmament, demobilization and rehabilitation (DDR) initiatives for a long time.  I think that the psychologists who work in DDR camps and most people associated with DDR are very interesting individuals.  I have spoke with a few over the past few years and really am intrigued by the complexities they are forced to struggle with.
