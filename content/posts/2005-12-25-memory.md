it has been so long even my computer didn’t "Remember Me." and I had to relog in to typepad.  How aweful of me.

am in Tennessee for the holidays.  It is what it always seems to be, text off family love, subtext of family angst.

See this will be the last Xmas in this house.  My aunt has returned for the first time in a while.  I have returned for the first time in a while.  In fact this is the most complete Christmas my grandmother has had in at least three years if not longer.  

But how does that make me feel?  Hell, that is why all of you pay the subscription fees for this site isn’t it….to hear my ramblings on feelings.  Not sure.  I tend to deal with angst as if it doesn’t exist, to just table something.  I don’t deal with it before I have to, and I barely deal with it when I am forced to.  Ignorance is bliss or something completely as idiotically moronic.

I am on drugs right now b/c I am sick….of life.  I’m the cough-master and the sneeze-machine and my chest-heaves and my head-aches, but I’ll get through.  Hell I have to since I’m leaving Tuesday for Aspen to ski.

It will be odd returning there, I think.  But we’ll have to see about that then.  More soon.
