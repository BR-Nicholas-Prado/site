I had a conversation I had with a Swiss woman who I work with about non-feasance as a basis for criminal prosecution.  I would like to proffer my philosophical ramblings about humanitarian interventionism, which is inextricably linked to non-feasance.  Obviously there are other links, to the duties in the genocide convention.  Maybe the best way to delimit the discussion is to speak solely about the Genocide convention.  I understand that without further legal research I may not have full comprehension of the *legal* bounds of the duty.  That said, I would like to explore whether humanitarian interventionism is a duty that states should impose upon states.  



I pulled three quotes from the Genocide convention that I think are relevant to the discussion.  (1) “Being convinced that, in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge, international co-operation is required, . . .” Chapeau.  (2)  “The Contracting Parties confirm that genocide, whether committed in time of peace or in time of war, is a crime under international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.” Art. 1.  (3) “Any Contracting Party may call upon the competent organs of the United Nations to take such action under the Charter of the United Nations as they consider appropriate for the prevention and suppression of acts of genocide or any of the other acts enumerated in Art III.” Art. 8.  In my mind, on the face of these three quotes, this means that all states that are party to the convention are under an obligation to prevent it and to punish it, but not to intervene in situations where genocide is occurring.  It seems that that duty rest with the international community.  Perhaps there is a duty to assist the international community in the sense that if the UN asks a state to send peacekeepers to a given country then they should comply with that request as part of their duty to prevent and punish.  I will return to the multilateral approach in a bit.



Unilateral humanitarian interventionism seems to me a recipe for disaster.  In fact, it seems to me that only in a very limited set of circumstances is unilateralism not a recipe for disaster.  In the conflict here in  
Sierra Leone

, there were unilateral interventions and there were multilateral interventions.  Many here felt that ECOMOG, despite the many atrocities that they committed (which were fewer than the RUF/AFRC, but many more than a western or UN force would have committed), was a legitimate intervention force.  Now it is hard to pin down why people thought that.  I am not sure whether they thought it was correct because they thought the AFRC/RUF were worse, or they preferred the “elected” Kabbah government or because they felt that the international community embodied in this West African regional IO was a legitimate force.  Likely it was a mix of all three of those variables.  NATO in Kosovo, despite the objections at the time, may have only survived because it was a multilateral force.  



I am not sure all my history is correct, but I think that when the Marines went into  
Somalia

 at the very beginning we were alone.  Whether that was the initial thrust of an overarching multilateral plan I am not aware.  I do know that we were the first in and the rest of the world, including the UN came later.  



The history aside, if legitimacy for humanitarian intervention can only come from a multilateral force does this make sense?  There are definite advantages to a multilateral approach: legitimacy derived from the UN and the SC, a healthy debate on the topic, leverage with other states in the region.  However, there may be advantages to a unilateral approach as well: speed and tempo can be achieved by the unity of command, especially with regards to regional interventions the intervening, foreign troops may be more culturally-sensitive to the “target” country.  



There are a couple of things that trouble me about a unilateral intervention.  The first is fairly realpolitik.  But what are the intervening state’s interests.  It seems to me that if the international community allowed a unilateral intervention to occur then really it would be one step away from allowing an invasion.  Countries in the region would merely incite under the table a genocide, and then intervene to set up a friendly government or continue to occupy “for the protection of the occupied people.”  *See Syria/Lebanon*.  The second one is despite the hang-ups that most of my Marine friends have with the UN, a unilateral approach may be less efficient.  Now, I would not argue that it would be inefficient for US Marines to go into  
East Timor

 alone and secure that country and keep the peace there for a temporary amount of time before handing over to another body.  I would not argue that it would inefficient for the Brits to do something similar.  But outside a handful of countries that have the capacity to get a fighting force efficiently to other parts of the world, it seems to me that a pooling of resources would be more efficient.  Lastly, genocide is a crime against humanity.  In my mind that means that the world community should be involved.  Even if it was a genocide against an ethnic group in one country and that ethnicity controlled in another country, it is still a crime against the entirety of humanity.  



I think that by taking it out of the hands of individual states the Genocide convention probably does it properly.  I mainly believe, for myself, that the *best* reason is the last that I have listed above.  Placing the decisions in the hands of multilateral bodies means that genocide remains a crime against the entirety of humanity.  A state or non-state actor who perpetrates genocide should feel the entirety of the weight of humanity against him or her.  This is likely to be the most efficient deterrence that can be created.  I must caveat my deterrence argument with the thought that the entirety of humanity must be ready to act when genocide occurs, something that heretofore has not happened.  



Although I do not believe that the institutional allocation should shift terribly towards the international, I think that in certain ways the current  
US

 isolationist approach is costing us much more than we are gaining out of.  While  
Europe

 continues to spend money on social services consistently fostering good will throughout the world and  
Asia

 spends money on education and infrastructure building (especially with regards to technical infrastructure) we flounder with a bloated defence budget.  This is a different topic entirely, but the point is that by becoming less isolationalist and more multilateralist we will save money that can go towards social services in our country or another or can go to the people directly in the form of tax relief (depending on one’s political proclivities).  It seems that many think that leadership can only come in the form of doing what you want when you want.  This is a medieval king’s approach to sovereignty.  Leadership can come in the form of example.  I will continue to advocate for engagement and leadership by participation until I am have been disproved.



There is much more here, but I should work now.
