Posner.  O Posner.  You may be smart, but you certainly are ignorant on many things.  When critiquing something that is internationalized perhaps you should pull your head out of your US only ass and look around the world.  The HDI is not used for anything in the developed world.  It means little to the developed world, because ranking industrialized democracies is only for pride sake.  What is the number 10 country going to do but get laughed at by numbers 1-9.  All of them have a standard of living that is vaguely unapproachable for the citizens of the countries who are ranked (no matter the ranking system) less than 75.  

My favorite part of this piece is graph:

First let me point out what this vaunted judge and law professor’s major problem with the HDI is: it is the combining of the indexes which troubles this self-proclaimed intellectual.  He goes on to say that he is also troubled about the lack of other factors which could be factored into the overall development index, but all while saying that he does not think that there is a difference between economic development and human development.

Many of my female friends absolutely detest this man for saying that there is an efficient amount of rape.  His point is fair enough, but does he have to say things in that manner.  I now know how they feel.  This piece absolutely enraged me for its complete lack of ignorance of the world.  It makes me ashamed to have attended law school.  It makes me ashamed to be an American.  Why do we continue to be so god damn ignorant of what lives outside our border?  

It was hip, in development circles, to criticize the methodology of how the HDI was calculated….five years ago.  (And fair enough, it is also hip in law school to criticize Posner if you are even remotely left leaning.)  But never have I heard it criticized from a uniquely developed country perspective where the critique is essentially for developed countries vis a vis other developed countries the methodology is a failure.  He doesn’t even get into the methodology for how the soft indexes are calculated, and I’m glad because although I’m certain that this extremely smart man could comprehend what was happening that he would have something completely enraging to say. 

OK, to something else.
