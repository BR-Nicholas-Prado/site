so i have backlogged the stories from last week while i was in the woods.  they are backdated to the approximate days and times when i constructed and/or experienced their bases.

this week has been busy, but good.  the woman i’m working for knows MANY MANY people who are very very well connected.  this weekend we are to meet McCain, i’m going to give him a copy of shooter.  next week even more people will be in town.  i’m told we’ll be heading up to a safehouse for some meetings of the intelligence committee.  it will be interesting.  one of her friends is quite high in the state department and lives in columbia doing development work.  "he is always looking for lawyers, especially."  i work through the rum fog to remember her telling me the other night.  good.  cause i’m always looking for a job, especially.

tomorrow night i’m going to hear a lesbian ac/dc cover band.  i’ll give you a review later, although i’m not sure how it could be anything but awesome.
