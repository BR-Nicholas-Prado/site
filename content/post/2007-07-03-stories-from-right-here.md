I think that Nora Ephron thinks that she is hilarious.  I think she is a bore.  And a bitch, but that is a different story predicated on seeing her in Asssspen a few summers ago and being majorly turned off by her snooty attitude.  [Link][1].

There was another intersting article in the NYT’s which speaks about Buying into the Green Movement and links between hip stylings in the name of save the earth that really are consumerism light and still have drastic impact on the planet.  lexus hybid SUV?  still requires massive amounts of corrosives and other chemicals to build, still gets 22 MPG (my car with regular gas engine averages 30 MPG).  [Link.][2]

highlands is visiting the highlands.  we spoke last night and she told me funny stories from the local papers about the scottish baggage handler who helped the police apprehend the terrorists at the glasgow airport by punching him….what a concept…too bad those at virginia tech didn’t have a little more scot blood in them.

as for the weekend, i did nothing and it was fantabulous.  i did meet with one of my mentors which was great.  we are hopefully going to be working on some good projects this fall, the nice thing for me is that they may link to what i’m doing now.  it will be quite nice to not be starting from step one, as per the norm in law school.  it will be nice to be able to dive deeply having much of the introduction stuff out of the way.  but for now i’m working on my paper from SL titled:  Sleepy Justice: Sierra Leone’s Lack of Self-Help in Judicial Sector Reform…or something similar.  I’ll post it when it is presentable.
