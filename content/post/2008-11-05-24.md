"Things are moving so fast in race relations a Negro could be president  
in 40 years. There's no question about it. In the next 40 years, a  
Negro can achieve the same position that my brother has. . . . But we  
have tried to make progress and we are making progress. . . . We are  
not going to accept the status quo."

~ Bobby Kennedy, Editorial in the Washington Post, May, 27, 1968
