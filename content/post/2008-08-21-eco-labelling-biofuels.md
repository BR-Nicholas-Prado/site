title: Eco-Labelling Biofuels

Geez, hippies love their eco-labeling.  Perhaps it comports with their world-view of non-force-ment of normatively superior products.  Perhaps it gives them something to talk about at parties, a consumer status-symbol.  Whatever the case, now there is a labeling standard for biofuels.  From [Triple Pundit][1]:

Manufacturers and other parties involved with biofuels have agreed on a global  
green biofuel standard. The [new  
standard][2] hopefully will eradicate the controversy and confusion that  
surrounds biofuels at the moment. Its main guarantee is food security and  
signatories include BP and Shell. 
The biofuel standard is very similar to the [Forest Stewardship Council’][3]s certification for  
different types of paper. The organization behind the biofuel standard is the [Roundtable  
on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB)][4]. It is located in Switzerland at the Energy  
Center at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL).

The signatories to the new standard include the big league oil companies BP  
and Shell as well as more than 300 professionals from organizations linked to  
biofuels both in the public and private sector and civil society movements. The  
RSB was formed because of all the bad press biofuels are getting and aims to  
inform consumers in depth about the good and the bad.
