title: Old Men Rule?

Rule #2 is Old Men Rule.  I have a shirt that says as much on it.  Yes, in those words.  I gaurantee you’ve seen it.  There is an interesting duality when I where it to school those as most people now know that I’m older than them.

Rule #3 is Work Smarter not Harder.  In that vein I give you a reply to another email.  A friend asked me what I thought about the distinct age difference between myself and those I now find myself surrounded by.  I give you that question below.

And now in celebration of my 29th Birthday:  A Treatise on Age

> I am conflicted in my thoughts on the age issue.  Considering the  
> backdrop of life in general and this especially being a competition (no

> is a "collegial atmosphere," its still a fucking competition…..) I  
> think that it is mostly to my "advantage," although there are a few  
> "disadvantages."
> 
> My view of much of my class is fairly close to what I expected:  greek,  
> business or poli sci majors, straight from college, clicky, etc.  In  
> the two weeks we’ve been together now I have watched the stratification  
> of this formerly nebulous mixture o people into their respective  
> pieces, or more appropriately how they have viewed themselves

> There are a few exceptions to the rules, those that are not greek,  
> those with interesting majore, those that took the vaunted one year  
> off, but by and large these exceptions are only in one category and  
> those that exhibit these exceptions fall into line on the other

> There are a few others.  I know of two with masters (one that has his

> Then there is me.  I’m not yet sure how I fit into the social spectrum,

> I’ve been in the real world, I know what it is like to spend entire

Happy Birthday to me.
