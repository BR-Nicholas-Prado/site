I cannot figure out if this song is a tortured love song or a prayer or both.  Nevertheless, I’ve been listening to it all morning…It fits nicely with the cloudy, humid skys filling up for the rainy season.  

I think we’re lost, don’t worry  
I’ve been here before  
I’m sure I thought I knew the way  
Out of here yesterday  
Dove cuesto, mi dolce?  
Your driver called, it’s time to go-  
Your driver’s waiting for you- 
And I caught a fever  
A holy fire-  
Til I was crawling on the ceiling  
Come out of your hole  
I know you know-  
You know I know-  
I wanna go-

Such a pretty thing, i’ve never seen  
Someone so perfectly deceive-  
I loved her smile-  
And her beguiling way with me  
She smelled exciting, I wanted some-  
Your drivers’ gone-  
Like everybody-

And that’s why I need ya-  
To catch on fire-  
I want you to burn me til I feel it-  
I know you know which way to go-  
I wantcha to show me  
So I can steal it-  
Where should we go?  
Where should we go?  
I knwo you know that I’m  
Gonna need it  
I know you know which way to go-  
I know you know-  
I wanna go

I googled to find the lyrics and this [review][1] came up.  My favorite words are:



> before i knew the backstory, i viewed this mainly as another skunk-on-the-make album, more tomcatting tunes from the mack daddy of alt-rock/soul. his persona — which, from what i know of him, extends into real life — is that sort of self-pitying compulsive lover-boy who alternately agonizes over and revels in his evilness. fairly irresistible on record; doubtless a nightmare to deal with in reality. but, as someone once said, "half the records in my house are made by people i wouldn’t *let into* my house." 

all is well in africa.  tunes are cranking.  work is cranking.  i’ll have a nice story for you today or tomorrow.  last night we went to this bar that reminded me strikingly of key west, and i’m not sure why.  it was more than the reggae.
