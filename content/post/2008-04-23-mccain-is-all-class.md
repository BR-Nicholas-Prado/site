I’m not a McCain supporter.  However, I am very very pleased that he was able to secure the Republican nomination.  The backstory is linked to above, but the letter below is prima facie evidence of McCain’s class as a human.  It is shit like this that I highly respect.  Very Well Done Mr. Senator.

> Once again, it is imperative that you withdraw this offensive advertisement.
