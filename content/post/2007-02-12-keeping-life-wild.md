[![100207_1802][2]][2]so this weekend we went to the chimpanzee reserve.  when i was first told about this place i thought it was like a natural park that you could walk through and maybe you would see chimpanzees.  then we were told about this one chimpanzee who was the alpha male of the lot who ‘broke out’ and killed one tourist and pulled the arms off of another (who subsequently bled to death).  they were american’s i think.  it made the news, although i do not remember it.  after the incident the chimps escaped into the bush and have not been seen since.  they are on the fly.  this made me very excited about going to the reserve, except for the getting your arms pulled out part.

but i still didn’t have a clear picture of what the hell was going on.  when we got there the tour guide told us that it was really a rehabilitation center for chimps who had been orphaned and then kept as pets.  usually they were found by people or the authorities and usually they were malnourished and neglected.  apparently the charm of having your own ape wears out fairly quickly for the expats and locals that pay $40 for one.  $40 can you imagine?

the center quarantines the chimps for three months and then slowly integrates them into the five distinct social groups they have on the campus.  the eldest group is in a 15 acre enclosure.   the youngest is in a 5 acre enclosure.  there are a couple in between.  the place seems to take good care of their 85 apes with three squares a day and the like.  the standard joke around is that the chimps live better than the average sierra leonian. 

i have posted the pictures, but i don’t really have any analysis for you.  the place was interesting to just watch.  i would have prefered if it was really a national park, but maybe next time.  

[![100207_0011][3]][3] in other news we went to a party up at the european council.  in these smaller countries the EU is establishing, essentially, consolidated embassies for the EU countries.  it makes some sense, especially in post-colonial countries.  although there is a possibility for it to salve some colonial wounds, i think it actually salts them.  here there is the british high commission and the EC.  those are the only embassies i’ve seen from europe.  i think that it serves to reinforce the colonialism here b/c the EC is small and out of the way, the BHC is large, magnificent and in the middle of it all.  anyway, the picture above is from that party where they had a burning pile of liquor where you would dip your finger in it and then put your firey finger in your mouth.  it was hot.  and then my friend claimed she didn’t see it so i had to do it again.
