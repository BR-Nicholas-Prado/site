dear music collection:

i love you.  

being without you has caused me to do crazy things.  i bought an ipod a day before i leave for africa becuase my last one, with you all up in it, decided to blow the fuck up.  it was a bastard anyway and i was getting jealous of your involvement with it.  it was good to have you back.  i looked at you on my computer, felt you when i packed and listened to you via a long series of cords and conundrums on my latest trip becuase the last ipod….well we won’t talk about that.  

i remember our first encounter at the turtles music store in chattanooga the christmas when i got my first cd player.  i was armed with a gift certificate from UD and i wanted to get the first pearl jam album.  the sheep on it made my mom squirmed so i settled on the eric clapton unplugged album.  there were tapes before, but that music was fleeting.  it was my first foray and you cannot fall in love when you are merely experimenting.  but that cd was real.  i still have it in hard and soft form.

the transition was difficult for both of us, i know.  when we moved over from cd’s to 0′s and 1′s we both took it hard.  i missed flipping through your plastic, rigged cases.  i think you missed me too.  it was so much easier to travel with you, but harder to communicate with you.  sometimes the screens were impersonal and sometimes it was difficult to find what i really wanted to listen to from your bloated ranks.  in the old days i would have to pull cd’s and put them in my caselogics.  this forced me to choose a smaller subset and would let me focus on making good choices in my life.

we’ve seen the world together.  and you always are there to remind me of my past, and keep me on the path towards the future whereever that will lead us.  whenever i think of home, parents, family, close friends, ex-girlfriends, places and events there is somewhere in your depths a song that will make your memory more poignant.  i will always remember having to pull off the side of the road because i was crying too hard after mamo died while listening to a dead can dance song.  i will always remember the hope of a new relationship that came while listening to 66 by afghan’s.  i will always remember my marines singing at the top of their lungs california, no doubt about it when we were returning from okinawa on a jet plane.  i will always remember my dad when i play billie joel and my mother when i play norah jones.  there are too many other permanent, cognitive overlaps to list.  suffice it to say you allow me to remember better than i can by myself.

you make me a better person.  by reminding me of my past and what value system i have chosen you keep me grounded.  whenever i think that something will be too difficult i put on some bob seger.  whenever i am confused about the present and how it relates to the future i put on the sunscreen song.  whenever i become frustrated with the lack of like-minded individuals around me i put on taylor mali.

you are beautiful, serene, and transformative.  won’t you join me in africa?  thanks.
