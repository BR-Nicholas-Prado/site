[![N557965146_50950_9850][2]][2] on sunday afternoon/evening there was a marching band parade and people just went into this compound (the wall is the background of the picture).  they paraded to a compound.  this picture doesn’t do it justice b/c there were TONS of people.  later we found out that it was a thanksgiving parade.  each local school has their own thanksgiving holiday where they march to a church.  not sure about the significance of it all, but it was funny nonetheless.

i feel odd when people ask me to tell them stories, because i don’t have many.  right now my life has been fairly boring.  just work, home, go out (maybe) and repeat.  

we cannot really talk about work, but i can say that it is interesting and intense stuff.  home is boring.  that leaves going out.

last night we went out to a place that went to during our first night here.  it was a nice difference to see how comfortable we have become in two weeks.  people say that freetown is the smallest 1M person city they have ever known.  i’m quickly finding that to be the case.  especially among the expat community.  when i first arrived here i was awed by the number of and symbols of ngo’s & io’s that were plastered onto the old land rovers driving the packed, diesel-fume-filled streets of this tight city.  every0ne that i had ever heard about was here: oxfam, usaid, unicef, british high council, save the children, and the list goes on and on.  it was like my entire folders of web links that have to do with activism, social entrepeneurship, and ID was plastered onto the side of small, inconspicuous, dilapidated signs for my eyes to graze as i drove or walked around this city.  at first it was daunting.  eventually i realized that it is a fairly small community.  

there were two things that i always envisioned myself doing.  one was living on vacation.  after two years of ski bumming and river ratting and being unemployed and writing and living a pretty outdoor lifestyle, i think that i can check that block.  the other was spurned by reading too much hemingway during my formative years (whatever the hell those are) and that was to live as an expat.  there is something magically romantic to me when the answers to where are you from come in the form of countries and accents are measured in degrees of separation from britian or paris or berlin or moscow as opposed to whether or not you watch nascar and go to church on sunday.

that is it for now.  i have piles on my desk.
