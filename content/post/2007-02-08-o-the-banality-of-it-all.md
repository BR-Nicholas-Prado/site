*having problems posting these picts, wait for it…..OK.  getting there.*

i have been asked to post some pictures of where i live.  consider that done.  we have four (total) flatmates that live in an old, square house that looks out over the ocean.  i have shown you the views from my personal balcony before.  this first picture is of the living room.  the furniture is old, and not really that comfortable, but it looks quite nice i guess.  at least i was impressed upon first viewing.  there is a large cabinet that houses our small tv and tempestuous dvd player.  

off to the right of the picture is where the dining room and kitchen are.  off to the left of the picture is where the main entrance is (looking down the main entrance from the landing is picture number 2).  last pictures are of my room which is at the top of the stairs, first one on the right.  it is kind of small and when i first moved in everything seemed to break at first touch. 

[![Imgp1155_1][3]][3] the first time i went to check the water in the shower the hot water handle fell off, it fell off, it fell, the f*ck, off.  [it is from a comedy bit] then after that the a/c went on the fritz which i think was due to bad generator fuel or maybe not.  i would turn on the a/c with the little remote that we have and the fan would slowly turn on, but then after a few seconds when (i think) the compressor would kick in, i could hear the generator start to drag decently (it is just an old diesel engine) and then the a/c would beep and the red light would not be lit.  so i would have to turn it back on again.  after about 28 times of turning it on and it turning itself off then the thing would finally stay on for a bit.  also there was no mosquito net or hangers or shower curtain in the room when i moved in.  now i can understand the mosquito net, maybe that is a ‘personal’ item.  but to take the hangers and the shower curtain?  that’s just dirty.  so for the first night when i moved in i made a mess in the shower area b/c there was hot water coming out of the handle and there was no shower curtain.  eventually that all got under control.

[![Imgp1165_1_1][4]][4] then only a matter of days after we got that fixed i wake up to a gigantic pool of water in the bathroom.  i’m telling you, it is a mess.  of course it was a sunday, and no one was working.  so i just mopped it the best i could and then waited it out until monday morning when they could get someone out to fix it.  i couldn’t tell at the time, but it must have been the bidet because when i came home that night there was a huge amount of chaulk around it and there has been no more water.  i haven’t yet used the bidet, b/c i’m american and incompetent.  however a new, little pool is forming around the sink from where the return pipe goes into the wall.  so i think that one is coming.

[![Imgp1153_1][5]][5] i was also asked what my diet has been like.  i’ve stayed veggie. but it has been really hard. the seafood looks out of this world. usually fruit for breakfast, rice and salad for lunch and then pasta with spinach or beans or something similar. more carbs than i would like, but i’m doing yoga pretty consistently and regulating my portions so i stay a lean mean typing machine. lots of fruit, but very few veggies. salad is hard b/c of the typhoid water, etc. you have to be extraordinarily careful, especially with leafy greens. tomatoes are not too difficult, although we don’t have a very sharp knife in the house, so peeling them can become onerous. drinks? lots of tea and a bit of coffee, and of course beer. the wines are either horrible or wonderful. hit or miss, like much here. there are lots of lebanese around, so when we go out the middle eastern food is generally very tasty.

ok enough of the mundane, you may like reading it, but likely you don’t.
