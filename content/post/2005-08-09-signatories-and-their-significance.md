finished kundera tonight, but it will stay on the list as i’m going to reread it through.  it was fucking intense.  it was my favorite book that i’ve read in the past three years, easily.

signed the lease in nashville today.  locked on the moving van for wednesday through friday.  dad has his plane tix to help in the move.  am depressed as shit and sick of hoping for it to end.  

guess if i just embrace it and then cope with the feelings that that will be better than trying to forestall the inevitable.  

for some reason this place seems to me to be like the apartment dave, natasha and i rented behind the library in champaign.  cannot figure out why, other than it is old.  maybe the presence of ghosts was what did it.  not exactly sure.

last night i had this vivid dream that oscillated between myself being turned into a demon and holding a pillow in the fetal position begging "god" to have mercy on me,  that i’d do what he wanted.  that i would submit.  it kept oscillating back and forth along two parallel lines moving independently.  in the end i woke with a racing heartbeat and no resolution to it.  later in the evening i dreamnt i was going to marry this really hideous woman who had a fish that looked like a bass.  i kept repeating, "but i like her soul, but i like her soul."

guess i just have to realize that i’m all fucked up right now.  i need a fucking cigarette, but am in the house of protestantism.  fuck.  maybe i’ll just go for a walk.
