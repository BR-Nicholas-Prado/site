this afternoon i fly out of salone and have no plans to return any time in the next two years.  

last night i finished packing in my idiosyncratic, logical-but-only-to-me, methodical way.  then i put on some nice music and stood on my balcony watching my last salone sunset.  like so many others it was underwhelming.  the sun faded into clouds, but if you looked to the east the nice purples developed and if you looked to the west, above the clouds, you could see the pinks and oranges.  it makes a nice metaphor for my final week here.  so much excitement, disappointment, frustration and sadness wrapped into each moment.  it wasn’t the finality of leaving a beautiful place that got to me, it was everything else.

on sunday 22 people died in a helicopter crash, but the only friggin’ reason that the damn bird was flying was because the owner of the heli company bribed the transportation minister after the last fire to let his company keep on flying.  two days ago the manager of the reservoir company which supplies the water to freetown was driving into freetown and saw some men filling their fire truck with public water to sell to lebanese and expat compounds.  they were stealing his water, and he is the one blamed whenever there is a shortage of water in freetown.  this practice is pervasive in the firemen community, apparently.  when the engineer stopped and told them not to do it, they beat him. to death.  

in a lot of ways it is time for me to leave here.  i feel that i have exhausted the good that i can do at this level of power which i currently possess.  i also feel, exhausted.  it is difficult, madening, and just tiring to live here.  but i love it.

the people are wonderful.  this morning martha was crying as i popped in my friends car buoyed by the prospects of my final adventure, undaunted by her tears lingering on my shoulder from our hug moments before.  i sat there and thought about the moment for a bit before i pulled out of my compound for the final time.  to me this has been an adventure, an exercise.  to saloneans, this is their life.  it breaks my heart.  a heavy cloud of sadness decending from the threatening rainclouds over my psyche.  

yesterday i drove with some friends through a tropical drenching with waterfalls all around tossing mud and trash onto streets and bridges making it all but passable.  the car had no a/c so the windshield was completely fogged at times, but people sauntered gingerly, just trying to keep their nice shoes from getting too mud splashed in the torential downpour with umbrellas to keep their beautiful, bright, colorful clothes pristine.  it blows my mind how long suffering these people are with their current state of existence.  

to me it is not surprising that there was a war, i’m only surprised that it actually ended and that it didn’t begin before it did.  

i drove up to leischeter peak this morning after leaving my compound for the final time.  i liked the circularity of it.  brett and i were driven up there on our first real day in salone.  it has a gorgeous view of the entire city, but when we arrived the harmatan winds had left the city opaque due to sahara dust.  today, because of the rains, the clarity hurt my eyes.  there were things that you couldn’t see, from the viewpoint you cannot see many of the larger slums throughout the city, and the beauty blows your mind.  the only sounds were birds and the clinks of people far below me whose only occupation is to break big rocks into smaller rocks…for something like $5 a week.  

up there i reflected upon how much i have learned here.  living one of the poorest countries in the world is doable.  you can create certain things if you know how to do it, you can host a party, you can get your car fixed, you can order catering.  you just have to know how to do it.  i finally feel like i reached the tipping point where i know how to do nearly everything that would need to happen, or at least i know who to talk to to get the number of someone that can do it for me.  it is a good feeling to feel settled and at ease with your surroundings.  it is surreal that those surroundings are not a new city or state in america, but rather one of the poorest countries in the world.  

this is it, this experience was a gamble.  if i had come to salone and hated my existence here all my pontifications and career decisions up to now would have been for naught.  but i have loved it here, and all those have been crystallized.  it is what i want to do.  here is why:

last night i was sitting on the concrete surrounded by eight young african men all talking in krio.  i understood most of what they were saying, and they didn’t even bother to translate or keep me in the loop.  i laughed at their jokes.  i gave the approriate krio exclamatory statements.  i felt a part of their community.  two of my old gaurds had come by along with some others that were not currently on duty to farewell me.  we were just sitting.  one of them had a portable cd player and was playing a cd i gave him, the most famous salone artist: emerson.  the fifth track on the song is titled, miss you.  it is about giving a lover a second chance, fairly non-complex lyrics.  they one by one fell silent until one of the young ones stood up and did a little dance to the song.  then he asked me whether i knew what the song was about.  i lied and told him no.  he told me the first part of it and then said that it meant something to him, that they were all going to miss me.  then i quoted that part in krio where the singer says that the lover should give him a second chance.  i meant that at some point i’ll be back.  they all laughed and then kept on taking the piss out of one another.  i will remember that moment for a very long time.  

now, for the next adventure.  sweet salone, i bid you adieu.  let’s do this again sometime very soon, but for now i need to go do some other things.
