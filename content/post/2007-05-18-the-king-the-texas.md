two notes on music.

1) have decided that elvis deserves his title.  we watched this video of his from 1967 or 68 in Vegas.  it was wild.  he was drunk. he sang. he wooed. simply: he is the flippin’ king.  i need to buy that shit, it was so good.

2) have bought my tix for [austin city limits][1].  september 14-16.  dig it:  dylan, bjork, arcade fire, bloc party, gotan project, joss stone, lucinda williams, indigo girls, decemberists, robert ear keen, lcd soundsystem (which highlands has renamed the cowbell crew), clap your hands say yeah, ben kweller, ziggy marley (were they both there last year?), yo la tengo, will hoge.  unfortunately no explosions in the sky.  oh well.  they may not be there, but i will be.
