excerpt: am slightly annoyed that one must now qualify which clinton one speaks of. 
  that aside [this podcast ][1]of a speech by Bill Clinton is a worthwhile hour spent
  in the car.  Clinton gave the keynote at the annual conference of the [Slate 60][2]. 
  These are the 60 largest charitable contributors of the year.  They hold an annual
  conference gala to celebrate how rich they are and how much they are able to contribute
  to worthy causes.  outside of the tongue-in-cheek overtones of the event, i think
  that it is likely that a lot of good things happened.  Bill’s speech is absolutely
  on point.  I find it fascinating to hear ex-President’s speak when no longer constrained
  by the various policy choices they are forced to make based upon often competing
  interests.  Even though politicians rarely have the gumption to do what they think
  is right, solely for that reason, many do take tough stances after they leave office. 
  to a certain extent this is the easy road, but it may be an easy road to just go
  into intellectual exile.  for whatever reason, clinton hasn’t taken that road. 
  he is still actively engaged, and no matter what one may think of his presidency
  the man is flippin’ brilliant.  what he says about philanthropy, especially with
  regards to engagement of people of modest means is spot on.
