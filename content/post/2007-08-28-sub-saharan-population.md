listened to an interesting [CFR podcast][1] the other day which discussed population levels in sub-saharan africa, which are currently exploding.  the guy was interesting to listen to as he was eloquent (it must come with the territory when you are the chair of sociology at NYU) and just when I thought he was going to swing naively left he hit me with an unexpected solution.  it was nice to be surprised like that!

urbanization (and other factors) is being blamed for a dramatic increase in the population in sub-saharan africa.  the problems with this should be self-evident.  poverty in this region is incredibly rampant and governments cannot use the few resources (mainly involving agricultural land which is lacking region wide, despite is prevalence in western africa) to feed and build their economies at the current population levels.  fertility rates are much higher in africa than in the other world.

traditional responses to population control have been to develop the country in concert with gender-equality measures.  the thinking is that women who are working will have less time to make babies as they have other things to do.  there may be something to this as in most industrial democracies women have much lower fertility rates.  yet, in africa people have been trying to develop the economies of the continent for years and they’re still in the position that their in economically despite those efforts.

another traditional response has been to force condoms, but this has very little likelihood of success as most african’s see it as the white people telling them not to have sex and they don’t really use the condoms.  it has worked for aids awareness, but not for population control.

china just killed babies and outlawed procreation.  i don’t see that happening either.

so, while listening to this i must admit that a horrible, cynical thought was creeping into my mind.  i thought, well if the health system stays as awful as it is in most countries i don’t see a crisis cause so many people die.  maybe it was a big conspiracy to suppress populations.  

to my surprise the commentator said the exact opposite of what i was thinking.  he said that we should put even more emphasis on reducing infant mortality rates (which was the opposite of what i had been thinking during his analysis of the problem).  he argued that this would allow people to self-regulate in that they would know that they were going to have surviving heirs to take care of them in their old age without having to make five babies to get one to survive and have a good, long life.  i agree with him as it is positive and forward thinking….maybe a bit unrealistic in the short term, but that epitomizes my life anyway!
