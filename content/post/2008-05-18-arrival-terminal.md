Well, for better or worse, I  
guess I’m settled in here now.  I am living in a hotel suite for the time  
being.  In maybe six weeks or so I’ll move either into a villa on the  
grounds of this hotel or have been talking to a few people here about the  
possibility of getting a compound like we had when I was in Salone.  Either  
way, the living is pretty decent.  

My suite has a TV with  
satellite connection (CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera English and some Dubai channels that  
show movies in English and a sports channel that has soccer on a lot), sitting  
room  with fridge, a bedroom with a big bed (hard as a rock) and a desk  
for me to do some work on.   
The hotel is a fairly big  
compound and I think I’m able to put human smuggling as a room charge, since I  
seem to be able to charge everything else on my room!  There is a restaurant  
and a little convenience store where I can get a few supplies.  All  
chargeable to my room.  There is wireless internet, although it seems to  
come and go.  The water runs and the  
electricity seems fairly constant without a loud generator.  So I’m in the  
lap of luxury!  

Sort of.   

The town is very poor.  I  
told Highlands that it is like Freetown without the natural beauty.  It  
is sort of in a bowl, surrounded by smallish hills on all sides.  My hotel  
sits on one of them and I have a great view of the town.  The surroundings  
are very much like when I was in 29 Palms, desert.  Although here it has  
rained most days and is a bit cooler than in 29 Palms, and here it is a bit  
flatter than it was in Cali.  The infrastructure in the town is somewhat  
better than Freetown, at least here most have running water and  
electricity.  Some people even have cable TV.  The roads are worse, most are dirt and the few that are  
paved are riddled with pot holes.  Luckily we have a Land Cruiser with  
good suspension and a driver who has a lead foot (for once that wasn’t sarcasm,  
I actually like him to drive faster on the roads b/c we miss many of the  
bumps).  

There is very little to do,  
unfortunately.  We went to an NGO/UN party last night, but left at 1130  
and were harassed at five checkpoints on the way back.  The police  
couldn’t fathom that we would want to be out that late!  So, there may be  
some cultural growing to do.  Maybe I’ll do it at the local theater that I  
drove by today on my way to the market!  Guess I’m going to get my fill of  
reading, writing and working until Highlands gets here, and likely  
afterwards.  

The people seem very  
relaxed.  They actually seem to like that I’m American.  It is an odd  
feeling.  They are much less aggressive and much more reserved than the  
West Africans (from what I’ve seen).  Today I went to the market to get  
some coffee and some veggies and was only asked for money once (by an old lady  
who had polio).  In Freetown I would have been asked at least 10,000 times  
for money.  They are also less gregarious and a bit harder to joke  
with.  We’ll see, I need to figure out what makes them tick before I am  
able to really develop a rapport with them.

My partner is nice.  From  
what I can tell he and I are getting along.  At the party last night I  
started to meet some in the local NGO/UN community.  It is extraordinarily  
small, all things considered.  But they all seemed like the others  
I met in West Africa.  I guess it takes a weirdo mind to get into this  
work and stay in it.  At least at the party there was a bit of beer.  
It is a dry country!!!!!  

All in all, there is the good  
and the bad, but I’m OK.  Once I get my feet under me I’ll be able to  
really assess whether I like it here, whether I like this work, etc.  But  
for now I’m happy and healthy, which is all I can ask for.

In case you were looking for pictures, I cannot  
provide them!  My camera has either been appropriated by some customs  
official along the way or was left behind for some insane reason.  Luckily  
I had recently cleaned off the card!  Not to fret, my graduation splurge  
for myself is going to be a nice DSLR that I will try to have someone get for  
me and ship over in a month or two.
