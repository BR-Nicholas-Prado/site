the internet is a fabulous, and deadly, weapon for mass destruction of society.  or maybe mass creation of different societies.  i’m not certain.

what i can be certain of is that i spent a good amount of time on said contraption this evening.  once i made the psychological and philosophical leap into the pool of law school, i made another leap.  i’m gonna be a rock star.  shit, i already have the hair for it, and fucking mick jagger and dylan cannot sing, so why should i be required to have that apptitude or ability?

in that vein i decided that it was time to begin establishing my base of groupies.  well, how do you do that when registration/orientation is six days away?  you get on the secured forums and whore yourself out.  then you find out that all the kids are about aim, not any of the other messenger services, so you pick up that ole’ axe, dust it off, plug it into the foot pedal and then into the amp and you strum a couple of notes.  gingerly, tentatively, just testing out the ole’ axe to see what sound she may be capable of.  then you get a little more confident and so you play a little tune, and before you know it you are completely rocking out until your mom knocks on the door, but since you’re rocking out so hard you don’t hear her and then she opens the door to ask if you wanna wanna fanta fanta and she is on one of those fucking jet ski’s jetting through a faux-water-like surface with a fake wake and you don’t know how to reply so you just stare at her and let your axe hang around your neck, but the ole’ axe didn’t have a shoulder strap when you picked up that ole’ thing so when you let it hang, it doesn’t hang as much as fall to the ground and makes a huge, horrible cord-esque/reverb-esque sound that is lovely to you, but horrible to mom and when it dies down you look at her and say, "see what you did?"

yeah nothing like that happened to me, nothing even remotely close to that happened to me, nothing even in the spirit of that metaphor happened to me.

i did however "meet" some people.  virtually, that means over the internet for the older listeners among you, "meet"-ed some people.  threw out a few funny emails, a bit of IM-ing banter, some networking (apparently friendster is D\_E\_A_D dead, in case you cared, the new friendster is facebook) sites where you put up your shit and they can all track you down….or something.  so my shite is out there and we’ll see how much of a rock star i can become.  needless to say, i’m getting it on virtual style.  

whatever happened to anticipation?  to getting to know people after you meet them on the big "first day of school" and then wondering which group you have the chance to fit in?  and if it is a conglomeration then maybe you should start your own group?  very uncomfortable….very exciting.  i guess i’ll only taste that.  but for now i’m happy being an internet rock star
