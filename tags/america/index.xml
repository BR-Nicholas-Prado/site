&lt;p>When you sit with people from other countries, it is important to have some fall back, standardized way to explain where you are from. Of course we all have these icons, these posters, these fleeting images that remind ourselves of where we came from and are readily recalled by our frontal cortex when asked to explain ourselves. When we trust the person and we know that the question is meant because the other conversant(s) truly does want to understand us, then we are more easily able to open up and to tell the truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I want to explain American rock music, and in a little bit the America that I know and love, to people who only know of America from what their news and Hollywood tells them I have a go to band. My icon for all that is great and wonderful about American rock music. Wax Fang.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are three dudes from Louisville who just build face melting rock and roll music. It is fast, aggressive, in your face, and musically delicious. In something like 2006 or so I saw them at Exit In for what was then known as Next Big Nashville. I think we were going to see a different band and just happened upon Wax Fang. They melted my face. Since then I’ve seen them a couple of times at the Basement. Always I’ve left with a melted face.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three dudes who know how to play their instruments really damn well, who don’t hide behind loops and over-reverb and autotuners. They play straight-forward. The guitarist has some David Gilmour, some Bowie. The bassist is just rock solid. And the drummer may be one of my favorite contemporary drummers. When I put on their La La Land album (particularly while driving because what could be more American than that), and drive all I can do is think of this all screwed up, dirty, aggressive, lovely, caring, wonderful country that we’ve built for ourselves and smile. So without further ramblings…. Wax Fang.&lt;/p>

Indeed, I think that patriotism now that we are moving into the post-states (for all intents and purposes) world has somehow turned into a dirty word. I’m not sure how that happened. Certainly, for us Americans, being the big, dumb, blumbering dude in a room filled with slicker, sleeker, shinier countries hasn’t helped our cause any.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, see, here’s the thing. We Americans ARE awesome. I mean I wouldn’t go so far as to say that we’re the most awesome (&lt;em>see, e.g.&lt;/em> our deeply teetering economy, our inability to solve any of the major global problems that the rest of the world is desperately looking for some leadership from us, and oh yeah Big Macs).  But we shouldn’t be afraid to say that even given all that, we’re still pretty awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this is where the Norah Jones comes into the equation.  I don’t know if it isn’t cool that I like her music.  *Yeah, all right you think, Come Away With Me as an alright song.  but she’s a bit too “pop-py” for my tastes *(and you would likely draw out the “oooooo” in that word).  But she has really incredible range.  She had great songs from a huge variety of genres.  And even when you try to take away the lens that your inner hipster hatred for the “pop” makes you don and you try to listen to each of her different songs as if they were from an artist who you normally associated with that genre.  In other words when she sings a country song, it is a really good song even if I thought of her whole persona as a country singer.  She’s digging up old slave / civil rights songs.  She’s licking on classic bluegrass and still classic but a bit more mainstream country and jazz songs.  And they all sound really good.  She’s working with tons of different types of people, likely trying finding some of the greatest musicians rolling around New York City right now to dig up exciting new combinations that really work.  And there, in that city, she has elite artists of possibly every single major and most minor musical cultures in the entire world.  It is cliche, but true, only in America.  Nobody else’s got that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I mean, sure, we got our panties in a wad over a freaking mosque being placed two blocks from ground zero, when daily I can’t walk two blocks without hitting at least three mosques wherever I go.  So we got that stuff, but we got cool stuff too.&lt;/p>
