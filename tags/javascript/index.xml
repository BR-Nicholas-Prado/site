Lexie is my friends&amp;rsquo; daughter and she is lovely. She had to do a Flat Stanley project but she named it Flat Lexie instead. So they sent me a Flat Lexie and we basically travelled the world together &amp;ndash; flat lexie and I. We had a few adventures so I wanted to try to capture the pictures I took but also to capture the geography and background of the different places.</description></item></channel></rss>
