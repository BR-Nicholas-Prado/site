I've tried KDE and Unity. I'd like to try Elementary, but probably on an old laptop I'm going to set up for my in laws rather than my primary machine. Since about Gnome Shell 3.2, though, I've done little more than take tours around other desktop interfaces.
In case you did not know, one of the greatest things about Linux is that you can do this.</description></item><item><title>How I Use Multiple Workspaces</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-19-using-multiple-workspaces/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2014-02-19-using-multiple-workspaces/</guid><description>When I first moved to Linux from Windows in Ubuntu 11.10, I was confused about multiple workspaces. I thought, coming from a Windows background, that they would be overkill and require significant resources from my very old at that time laptop. My laptop then was about a 5 year old Dell that Windows Vista barely worked on. One of the huge reasons I decided to try Linux at all was the way that it was reported to be able to handle older hardware with style and grace.</description></item><item><title>Autostarting Different Programs in Different Desktops</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2013-04-12-autostarting-for-different-linux-desktops/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2013-04-12-autostarting-for-different-linux-desktops/</guid><description>One of the most obvious appeals of Linux to me is the insane levels of customization you can achieve. I mainly use Gnome Shell as my desktop environment, but since I use Ubuntu I keep Unity on my machine. I'm not a hater of Unity or Gnome as many Linux users (who can be quite vitriolic in their statements as to desktop environments). I mostly use Gnome, but since Ubuntu has some interesting things going on with Unity sometimes I like to drop into Unity to see what I'm missing.</description></item></channel></rss>
