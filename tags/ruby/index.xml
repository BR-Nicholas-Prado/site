Mostly the changes should be transparent to users. Now that I feel that am getting a better handle on Ruby, I wanted to refactor the code quite a bit. There were a couple of motivations for this. First, I wanted to put the code more inline with common rubyisms and software construction methods. Second, I wanted to make the gem more flexible.</description></item><item><title>Flat Lexie Does Javascript</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2013-04-25-flat-lexie-does-javascript/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2013-04-25-flat-lexie-does-javascript/</guid><description>This week I threw together a little site for the daughter of some friends. Lexie is my friends&amp;rsquo; daughter and she is lovely. She had to do a Flat Stanley project but she named it Flat Lexie instead. So they sent me a Flat Lexie and we basically travelled the world together &amp;ndash; flat lexie and I. We had a few adventures so I wanted to try to capture the pictures I took but also to capture the geography and background of the different places.</description></item><item><title>Migrating underWater desert Blogging to Jekyll</title><link>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2013-04-18-migrating-udb-to-jekyll/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Apr 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2013-04-18-migrating-udb-to-jekyll/</guid><description>Wordpress is a great system. A really great system, actually. Especially for non-technical users. It also requires a huge amount of overhead for what most people use it for. Also, it is not nearly as fast and reliable as I would like it to be. So I decided that my blog needed to move from Wordpress to Jekyll. I had been using the same blog theme for about four years now so I also wanted to refactor that.</description></item></channel></rss>
