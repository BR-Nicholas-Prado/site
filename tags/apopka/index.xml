&lt;p>With such a soundtrack for successful blogging, I would like to thank my dad for (via nature &amp;amp; nurture) imbuing in me a curiosity and an open-mindedness about the world that have led me along the crazy path I’ve lived so far.  And although it has driven us apart geographically (as Ballad of Billy the Kid comes on) and forced me to miss some of these days in person, I’m there with you in spirit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I love you dad.&lt;/p>
