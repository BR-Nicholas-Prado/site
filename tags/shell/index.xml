My argument to others to use your shell more is simply that you see what is happening with your computer a lot easier than you can with a graphical user interface (GUI). Basically, your shell is somewhat like a glass bottom boat to see what your computer is actually doing. On linux, GUI's often have an option to pull up some of what your computer is doing, but for the most part they do not.</description></item></channel></rss>
