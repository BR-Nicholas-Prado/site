For three of those years I was paid to try to be their lawyer. To provide them expert international legal assistance tied to a deep network full of some of the finest international practitioners and thinkers in the world. But they rarely, if ever, wanted that help.

At first glance, most people who would read such a report will likely think, oh the poor people in Mogadishu. Of course, I share their sentiments. However, there is a deeper issue at work here. One that I'm not sure many people realize.
