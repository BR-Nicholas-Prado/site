I am still unsure about much of the commentary at [NYT's Triple Pundit blog][1].  Sometimes I genuinely am interested, but the majority of times it seems largely irrelevant and unworkable.  That said, I embrace what they are trying to accomplish.  I especially like two articles that were posted today which show how trends and thinking that has largely been applied to the developing world are leaking into the developed world.  This is really positive.

[This ][2]is an interest article exploring BOP business models within the US. This is good to hear as usually these models are seen to be only a phenomenon of the developing world, but I haven't been seeing why they would not be equally applicable and useful for poverty reduction in the developed world.

[This][3] is the other article which speaks about micro-lending in the US.  This is another trend which has been used throughout many, many countries in the developing world with a huge success rate.  [Grameen][4] basically invented it, but [Kiva ][5]made it famous.  I am pleased to see that at least one company is taking up the challenge of applying it to the US.
