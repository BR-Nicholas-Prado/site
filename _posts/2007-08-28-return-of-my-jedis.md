am back in nashville.  i don’t hate it as much as i thought i was going to.  right now.  arrived in the states a week ago today after three straight weeks of torrid traveling that took me to grand places with two of my favorite people in the world.  that was good.  many stories which will not get published here as i am now out of time.  

spent monday with a friend in miami and then drove to orlando.  almost instantly after stepping off the plane i acquired a cold that has just now left me despite od’ing on airborne.  spent tuesday in orlando with my mom and then drove on wednesday to chattanooga to see my uncle.  then drove to nashville thursday morning for a meeting with my mentor and orientation for my journal.  crashed thursday afternoon with a massive headache.  spent friday pulling miles of boxes out of my storage unit.  spent saturday constructing and placing the furniture and big stuff in.  spent sunday arranging, decorating and returning all the stuff that i’m not going to be able to keep here to the unit.  then today i started classes.

have a fairly light class load this semester which is good as i’m working on two independent projects which are going to take up much of my time.

one of my best friends, dave, his wife was supposed to go into the hospital today to have their baby.  i hope that it happens…it is overdue and they seem to be getting anxious.  i want to see that child!
