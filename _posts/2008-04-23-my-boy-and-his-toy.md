 [1]: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/22/arts/television/22king.html?ref=todayspaper "John King of CNN Revels in His High-Tech Election Night Toy - New York Times"

NYT profiles the best political commentator on television.  I once saw him point to this big map and circle a part of Florida and say something akin to: "This part of Florida right here, just south of Orlando is the home to the Non-Mexican, Non-Puerto Rican Latin population in Florida."  Who the hell knows that?  I rifled quickly through my mental database and could find no evidence, even after growing up in Orlando, to contradict that.  

And he does that with every state that he commentates on.  

Good win for HRC tonight.  Congrats.  One of the CNN guys said it best, "this is the best number to keep this campaign going.  Any more and she would have blown him out and the supers would mass migrate to her.  Any less and she would have been forced out. "    
Now Obama gives his speech.  On and on the train moves.
