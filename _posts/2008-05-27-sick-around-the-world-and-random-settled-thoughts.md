In case you missed it, I've posted the first YouTube link to the very excellent PBS Frontline special "Sick Around the World."  A Washington Post reporter went to six industrialized nations and asked how they've been able to ensure universal healthcare at a much lower cost than the US has been able to figure out.  

Now that I'm here in S-land am becoming addicted to web content.  Frontline has all of their documentaries up.  Another great site I've found is: http://freedocumentaries.org which has tons of documentaries available for downloading.  Not sure the quality as I've been downloading other things, but will get to some of these documentaries soon. 

In other news, am hoping to become the gardener of H-town.  A new found friend, a Kenyan guy who works for an iNGO is also looking for a house.  If we do get a house, I'm planning to plant some veggies and some herbs.  Now, if only I could get my stereo across, purchase a cheap projector to watch TV on the wall, get a faster VSAT connection and find some CHEESE, I'll be set.  

Have been listen to lots of hip hop lately.  Kanye is really f-ing good.  Not sure why it took me so long to get into him.
