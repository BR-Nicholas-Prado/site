So, have commented on a blog besides my own for the first time.

I have been reading [Chris Blattman’s blog][2] on development for a while, and today he posed a question about the admissibility of evidence.  He was legitimately questioning whether, as a legal or policy reason, drawing made by [children in Darfur ][3](such as the one presented here) should be admitted if they ever get [Harun and Rahman][4].
