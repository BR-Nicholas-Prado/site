Happy Thanksgiving all.  I’ll be at friends drinking mass quantities of rum and beer, eating mass quantitites of meat and watching mass quantities of football.  AHHHHHH, the most masculine of all holidays.  

Yesterday I was driving somewhere and I saw an entire house decorated up for Thanksgiving.  I thought, "now there’s some peep’s that know how to give thanksgiving its props."  I don’t like it when Thanksgiving doesn’t get its props.
