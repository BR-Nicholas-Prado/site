This speech is 40 minutes long and it will be the best thing that you do today.  Do not let someone else help form your opinions on this speech.  Form your own.  The embed:

[][1][][1][][1][][1][][1] 
Now, to my reactions.  Everyone is right that it is brilliant and nuanced, honest and frank.  Charles Murray, the conservative author who raised much controversy with the [Bell Curve][2] called the speech "[brilliant][3]."  [Most politicos][4] I’ve read have thought it was the most frank and honest speech on race during their lifetimes.  That is likely true.  I don’t cover politics, but I do play someone who does on television, and I can certainly say that it qualified in that regard.

Apparently, this is meant to be the week of [speeches][5]  
for Barack.  I truly hope that his speech tomorrow on Iraq and his  
speech the next day on the economy (with its linkages to Iraq) will be  
as complex as this one.  This speech, I admit, was not full of  
solutions.  It was a world-view dissertation.  For a long time I have  
argued that the "Barack is vacuous"  line is complete intellectual  
dishonesty.  I am excited for him to shine.  

But I have two reactions that (hopefully) are not completely informed by the massive amounts of punditry that I’ve read since watching the speech.  People will likely dissect the speech in every shape and form.  I actually have little to say that will likely be unique about the content of his speech and prefer to analyze it at a pomo remove.  

Point 1:  I am struck that [Barack wrote this alone][6] and it was not a collaborative effort.  On the one hand I am hesitant to endorse someone who keeps his own company, especially someone who is managing one of the most complex organizations in the world and will never have a complete handle on the issues and the facts and will be reliant on others to distill what is important because there simply is not enough seconds in the day to be able to grab everything.  Too closehold of a management style is disadvantageous in the political spectrum.  Yet on the other hand, the President (though the "face") needs to be able to have solidly held beliefs that are formed by a distinctive world view.  Too little of an idea about what one’s views are can be detrimental.  Clinton was magical at being a complete vacuum of world view and basing many decisions upon short-term political gains.  The gist of the Republican argument since the Clinton administration is that they hold to their beliefs and do not shift with the winds of the moment.  Barack seems willing to say anything you can do, I can do….better (he would argue).  Although there is a fine line here, I would prefer to have a President that does not change with the winds of the moment and is willing to keep his own company as long as he is open to dissent and flexible enough to know when to change.  It is like the old christian poem which ends with the "wisdom to know the difference." This is where the trust of politics comes into play (trust, I would argue is one of the major normative bases for identity politics which is as unavoidable in modern America as it was in the recent [Kenyan elections][7]).   

More important, intellectually, than the trust factor (to me), is that Obama is willing to buck the political trend when he feels strongly about an issue.  There was no polling to help refine his views on this issue.  He did not need that.  He has experienced things acutely in his short life that resonate with both of my major iterations.  His expose about white frustration at affirmative action and urban crime were very much how I’ve thought at times in my life.  His discussion of black anger because of a history which has seemed to pit the world against the black community is very much in line with my current views after talking to those who have studied education much more in depth than I have.  Both of these resonated with me in a very real and powerful way.  But yet, he did not need to have some whites and blacks on a committee to tell him their stories.  His story is incredibly unique in that he intimately understands both of these major sides to the coin without having to rely on someone to tell him "what the American people think."  Yes, obviously there is a danger here because a politician should *never* close off inputs, dissent and alternate world views.  No one that I’ve heard has made that claim against Barack so I am comfortable that an Obama administration would not be closed off.  Yet it seems to be principled in a way that other campaigns likely will not be, precisely because he is able to relate in a way that most intellectuals and elites cannot.  

I was sitting at my computer watching this on YouTube, I closed my eyes and just listened to the speech and thought, "Damn, if we can elect this man I can be publicly proud to be an American again….No matter if I’m in Somalia or Sierra Leone or Holland or Scotland or Chattanooga."  In my opinion, THAT is why we elect a President.  Sure there are policy stances and we want the government to be receptive to our concerns.  Those are supremely important, but for me, that is what I base my legislative voting decisions upon.  Presidential decisions present me with an entirely different calculus because the President has a fundamentally different job.  I’m sure that any of the three candidates will do things that I agree and disagree with, but which one of them will make me proudly tell people I’m American and not make me want to tell people I’m Canadian when I travel.

Point 2:  I think that there will likely be continued rumblings about the complexity of the speech and people will likely argue that it is only going to be accessible to elites and that mainstream America will not be affected by this speech.  That is true if mainstream America does not watch and listen to the speech and actually reflect on the truthiness of what Barack is saying.  But there is nothing that stood out to me as particularly complex or inaccessible about what he was saying.  I have been continually annoyed over the years at the lack of complexity in political discourse.  Many have written books on the dumbing of America.  Go to Amazon and I’m sure that you will find hundreds.  I like Obama not so much because I agree with his message (although that obviously helps) but more because I respect his willingness to engage in complex dialogue with his supporters and detractors alike. Culturally I agree with those who decry the lack of complex political debate and I become concerned as to how long our "greatness" (whatever that is) will be sustainable if we continue to patronize people rather than force them to think critically about issues and form their own opinions.I think that changes in media dissemination (mainly meaning the internet, etc.) both help and hurt. Although there is increased access to something like a major policy speech by a candidate, there is also increased shrillness both for and against it and thinly veiled for and against coverage. The point is not that technology has helped or hurt our culture, it is that if there is a continued cultural reliance upon other’s analysis rather than source-level inquiries and critical thinking then I question where we shall end up.  

To bring the argument back around on itself (hopefully without being circular), this is precisely what Obama does in this speech.  He has formed his own opinions based upon his experiences and his understanding of the facts that do not come across as colored and polished in the same way that most others (black or white) would come across giving a similar speech.  He talked for 40 minutes straight and rarely looked at any notes, yet was eloquent in a way that made me believe that he truly understood what he was saying.  I feel (no matter whether it is true or not) that he had formed those opinions himself based on his thought and not Mark Penn telling him what the American people want to hear.  

Intellect should not be a dirty word and critical thought is not  
something that people in small liberal arts colleges engage in over  
hipster beers or free-trade coffee.  Critical thought simply means  
forming your own opinions on matters based upon a reading of the facts  
as you think they exist.  Yet, these seem to be dirty words.  Not sure,  
but, like I always say, I’m all about Dirty Deeds, Done Dirt Cheap.
