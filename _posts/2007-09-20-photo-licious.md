so I finally have up the [photos ][1]from Georgia and Azerbaijan.  It took me a while as I didn’t think that I had the photos, last night in the nether regions of my bag I found the camera card on which the pictures were resting.  The pictures include, possibly, the best picture I’ve ever taken.  At least it is my favorite picture that I’ve ever taken…
