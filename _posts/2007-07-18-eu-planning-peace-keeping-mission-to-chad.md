[![Africapol][2]][2]  
[this][2] is interesting as well.  the eu is planning on sending a small peacekeeping mission to eastern chad in order to stop spillovers from the sudan fighting.

[chad][3] is a pretty messed up place in general, with[ internal insurgencies][4], [governmental use of child soldiers ][5]and the [spillover of conflict from sudan][6].  but that isn’t what makes this news story interesting.  what interests me is the eu continuing its walk down the federalism aisle.  i’m not sure if their motivations are that they are of a singular mind with regards to foreign policy or if it is simply that in this case they could be of a singular mind with regard to the point.  taking these disparate countries who used to see the [EC][7] as merely an economic body and to watch the (almost) acquiesce to a constitution and then a reworking of the treaty to strengthen it further.  now the EU opens diplomatic missions and embassies in many small countries, rather than the individual countries performing the duties.  now the [EU][8] sets monetary policy and development goals wherein the member countries are enabled to layer on top more support, but the EU is setting the minimum donor allocation to given countries.  for a long time the EU has participated in peace-treaty missions, but now it is acting with more "force" outside its normal sphere of influence (which kosovo admittedly was and i feel that that is a different situation in that there were spillover concerns as well as, likely, concerns about the possibilities for future former communist bloc states.)

the act of sending peace-keepers with an EU mandate i find inherently fascinating.  this is a fundamental (in my mind) difference from sending peace-keepers with a mandate from the UN or a regional international organization of which the affected country is a part of.  this is neither the OAU or the UN (chad is a member of each and therefore has ceded sovereignty to those organizations), but this is the EU acting with Chad’s blessing, but in a forceful way, creating peace and policing borders of a state which is not a member state of the IO’s.  

historically, at least since post WWII, the UN has been the organization with the mandate to maintain and restore the peace.  it has retained that mandate, but it has been watered down due to inefficiencies in the system, the lack of engagement by the powerful countries on the security counsel, and simple international politics and power-games.  at least in africa what has filled the gap have been regional international organizations.  for instance in western africa there is the economic community of west african states or [ECOWAS.][9]  ecowas started (like the EC) as a regional economic organization and eventually blossomed into the realm of peacekeeping when it sent the ECOWAS Military Observation Group or ECOMOG into Liberia (and subsequently other member states).  the ECOWAS member states argued in 1991 just before ECOMOG went into Liberia, that it was in the economic interest of the member states to build and maintain peace in each country of the member states.  similarly, the [OAU][10] and the [Commonwealth][11] have also performed peacekeeping missions inside member states.

again each of these makes sense to me as the "targetted" state has signed up for a given international organization and has a say in what they do.  the EU deployment to chad is different in that it is more like a bilateral partnership with the US, the UK, or the like.  but how can the EU which is a multilateral organization create bilateral partnerships without the member states of the multilateral organization either: (1) having a say in each and every decision which is wholly impossible especially in a peacekeeping mission with too many decision points (i say this in contrast to signing a services contract where the decisions points are up front and then maybe at renegotiation), or (2) the member states outsourcing decision making to the peacekeeping force itself or to the international organization.  the latter is what happens in the US where the individual states have outsourced all foreign policy matters to the federal government. see [this][12] for a discussion of the mandate that the EU will likely/should have.

europe is definitely not to that point, (despite how flattering it would be for them to go that far) but i question how far it will get along the road before the policies of the member states become divergent.  it is easy for the member states to agree on the norm against genocide or crimes against humanity.  it is another thing if the EU wants to adopt a nuanced foreign policy position with regards to Russia’s response to [Britain kicking out the Russian Diplomats][13]!

i don’t know where it is heading, and of course being american i am not so much of a stake holder, but it is interesting to watch nonetheless.
