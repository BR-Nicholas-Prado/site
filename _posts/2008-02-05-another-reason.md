This is why [I Support][1] [Barack.][2]  Not for the celebrities; Not because of his blatant appeals to people in my demographic; But Because of the Words.  Listen to the Words, Big_Head once told me.  [I’m listening][3].

This is what the creator said about this video.  I’m not an artist, I do other things, but I agree with almost everything he says.

> I was sitting in my recording studio watching the debates…  
> Torn between the candidates  
> I was never really big on politics…  
> and actually I’m still not big on politics…  
> but 4 years ago, me and the black eyed peas supported Kerry…  
> And we supported Kerry with all our might…  
> We performed and performed and performed for the DNC…  
> doing all we could do to get the youth involved…
> 
> The outcome of the last 2 elections has saddened me…  
> on how unfair, backwards, upside down, unbalanced, untruthful,   
> corrupt, and just simply, how wrong the world and "politics" are…
> 
> So this year i wanted to get involved and do all i could early…
> 
> And i found myself torn…  
> because this time it’s not that simple…  
> our choices aren’t as clear as the last elections …  
> last time it was so obvious…  
> Bush and war vs. no bush and no war…
> 
> But this time it’s not that simple…  
> and there are a lot of people that are torn just like i am…  
> So for awhile I put it off and i was going to wait until it was decided for me…
> 
> And then came New Hampshire…  
> And i was captivated…  
> Inspired…
> 
> I reflected on my life…  
> and the blessings I have…  
> and the people who fought for me to have these rights and blessings…
> 
> and I’m not talking about a "black thing"  
> I’m talking about a "human thing" me as a "person"  
> an American…
> 
> That speech made me think of Martin Luther King…  
> Kennedy…  
> and Lincoln…  
> and all the others that have fought for what we have today…
> 
> what America is "supposed" to be…
> 
> freedom…  
> equality…  
> and truth…
> 
> and thats not what we have today…  
> we think we are free…  
> but in reality terror and fear controls our decisions…
> 
> this is not the America that our pioneers and leaders fought and  
> died for…
> 
> and then there was New Hampshire
> 
> it was that speech…  
> like many great speeches…  
> that one moved me…  
> because words and ideas are powerful…
> 
> It made me think…  
> and realize that today we have "very few" leaders…  
> maybe none…
> 
> but that speech…
> 
> it inspired me…
> 
> it inspired me to look inside myself and outwards towards the world…  
> it inspired me to want to change myself to better the world…  
> and take a "leap" towards change…  
> and hope that others become inspired to do the same…  
> change themselves..  
> change their greed…  
> change their fears…  
> and if we "change that"  
> "then hey"..  
> we got something right…???…
> 
> 1 week later after the speech settled in me…  
> I began making this song…  
> I came up with the idea to turn his speech into a song…  
> because that speech effected and touched my inner core like nothing in a very long time…
> 
> it spoke to me…
> 
> because words and ideas are powerful…
> 
> I just wanted to add a melody to those words…  
> I wanted the inspiration that was bubbling inside me to take over…
> 
> so i let it..
> 
> I wasn’t afraid to stand for something…  
> to stand for "change"…  
> I wasn’t afraid of "fear"…  
> it was pure inspiration…
> 
> so I called my friends…  
> and they called their friends…  
> in a matter of 2 days…  
> We made the song and video…
> 
> Usually this process would take months…  
> a bunch of record company people figuring out strategies and release dates…  
> interviews…  
> all that stuff…  
> but this time i took it in my own hands…  
> so i called my friends sarah pantera, mike jurkovac, fred goldring, and jesse dylan to help make it happen…  
> and they called their friends..  
> and we did it together in 48 hours…  
> and instead of putting it in the hands of profit we put it in the hands of inspiration…
> 
> then we put it on the net for the world to feel…
> 
> When you are truly inspired..  
> magic happens…  
> incredible things happen…  
> love happens..  
> (and with that combination)
> 
> "love, and inspiration"
> 
> change happens…
> 
> "change for the better"  
> Inspiration breeds change…
> 
> "Positive change"…
> 
> no one on this planet is truly experienced to handle the obstacles we face today…  
> Terror, fear, lies, agendas, politics, money, all the above…  
> It’s all scary…
> 
> Martin Luther King didn’t have experience to lead…  
> Kennedy didn’t have experience to lead…  
> Susan B. Anthony…  
> Nelson Mandella…  
> Rosa Parks…  
> Gandhi…  
> Anne Frank…  
> and everyone else who has had a hand in molding the freedoms we have and take for granted today…
> 
> no one truly has experience to deal with the world today…
> 
> they just need "desire, strength, courage ability, and passion" to change…  
> and to stand for something even when people say it’s not possible…
> 
> America would not be here "today" if we didn’t stand and fight for  
> change "yesterday"…  
> Everything we have as a "people" is because of the "people" who fought for  
> change…  
> and whoever is the President has to realize we have a lot of changing to do
> 
> I’m not trying to convince people to see things how i do…  
> I produced this song to share my new found inspiration and how I’ve been moved…  
> I hope this song will make you feel…  
> love…  
> and think…  
> and be inspired just like the speech inspired me…
> 
> that’s all…
> 
> Let’s all come together like America is supposed to…  
> Like Japan did after Hiroshima…
> 
> that was less than 65 years ago…  
> and look at Japan now…
> 
> they did it together…  
> they did it…
> 
> "We can’t?…
> 
> Are you serious..?..
> 
> WE CAN!!!
> 
> Yes we can…  
> A United "America"  
> Democrats, Republicans and Independents together…  
> Building a new America
> 
> We can do it…  
> "TOGETHER"

This is the original speech which inspired the song, it is art in its own right.
