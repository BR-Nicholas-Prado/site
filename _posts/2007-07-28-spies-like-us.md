[![Spies84][2]][2]i used to love that flipping movie.  now i cannot remember how they inserted themselves into the the soviet union.  it may have been through afghanistan or one of the other stans, but for the purpose of this trip i’m going to pretend that it was through turkey and then up and over the caucasuses  through geogia and azerbaijan (which i realize were part of the soviet strategic envelope (primary version, as opposed to secondary, derivative version…i’ll be there soon).

nevertheless, i’m going to pretend that i’m these dudes for the next two weeks as we [dodge chechnyan separatists][2], [old soviet landmines][3], [drink wine][4], [eat food][5], [hike][6], [ride horses ][7]and maybe [do some vineyard work][8], [buy some ancient rugs or copperware][9], [visit old churches][10] and try to [talk to medieval dudes ][11]who still think the russians will come over the mountains any day (which they could, frankly) and therefore arm themselves with swords…!

here goes nothing…!  into the belly of the great soviet bear we venture.  and by belly, i mean belly, as this region used to provide most of the food (besides grain, that was ukraine where my ancestors came from) for the empire.

good-bye.  be back in two weeks with stories, if not sooner.
