people do stupid shit for stupid reasons all the time.  i do yoga.

i look around the studio from time to time and i wonder why everyone else is there.  i think at my studio here in nashville most people are doing the hot yoga becuase it is, like, so relaxing.  that and it is close to their little sorority houses.  these are the girls in short tight black shorts, blue sports bras and t-shirts with party titles over them.  they bring their cell phones into class; they bring their mouths into class; they bring their figetting into class; they’ve got it all as i’m sure they are happy to proclaim.  that isn’t why i do yoga.

i think that many other people do it to lose weight.  this seems a much more laudable goal than the passive workout goal that the slut-ority girls take.  these people are very passive as well, but in a different way.  they are their with their loose shorts, their blank t-shirts and a look of determination, pain and hope in their eyes.  that isn’t why i do yoga.

then there are the workout junkies.  these are the women that i see a couple of times a week and the other guy who i see a bunch.  they are in yoga clothes, they have carriers for their yoga mats.  they bring cockiness, energy, flexibility and happiness into the room.  they are the ones that laugh when the teacher claims that we’re going to be in the pose for only seven more minutes, becuase they are in shape enough to be relaxed enough to laugh.  that isn’t why i do yoga.

at times during my journey through yoga i have been in each of these three categories.  passive workout, weight loss determined, junkie performance focussed.  i’m not sure how i would categorize myself now, though.  when i first started i was in colorado and was in great shape, running five times a week and attending yoga once.  i just wanted something different.  i was starting down the holistic road that i currently am further along and i had read so many times what good it was for your balance (which i sought for skiing, climbing and kayaking) as well as your strength and focus (which i sought for….life).  

at first i was baffled.  it was a constant mental endeavour that i didn’t really enjoy but took enjoyment at a remove from the masichistic happenings.  i liked that i wasn’t comfortable.  i liked that i wasn’t sane.  i liked that i wasn’t god.  

then after i moved to nashville and started to settle in here i started to go about twice a week and was running about three or so times a week.  at this point i had been running for about 12 years, averaging something like 20 or 25 miles a week on my legs.  that is a lot of miles: do the math.  i was really tight and i was starting to show in the yoga studio.  my hips, my gluts, my quads were all no where near as flexible as they should be for someone who was actually in shape.  i overcompensated for this by forcing my way into poses.  i pulled muscles constantly.  i had no balance, but i had focus and i muscled through poses.

during winter break last year my knees started to give me fits while running and i made a pact with myself to take a year off of running and to just do yoga.  i had been steadily creschendoing my attendence to yoga all along the way and i knew that it could sufice to keep me in shape and slender enough to not kill myself plus it wouldn’t bang my legs as much.  so i started going about four times a week.  that was enough.  i started to get really used to things.  i got used to the sequence.  i got used to my heartrate and when it increased and decreased.  i thought i was figuring it all out.  i wasn’t.

lately i’ve been steadily instituting half-ass yoga sessions where i force myself to not muscle anything, but to just take a step off of every pose.  go into them 3/4 of what i would normally do.  i started to learn some things.  i started to learn how to relax.  i went much deeper objectively when i relaxed.  it was antithetical to the modern western view of how to work out.  if you want to get bigger you put more weight on the bar.  if you want to get more flexible you relax.  this is becuase muscles have little springs that keep the muscle from ripping away from the bone.  these springs clamp down with you force something, but if you can get them to relax the muscles can generally get looser.

but this is a story, not a reason.  i go to yoga b/c it is my rock.  it is the only steadiness in my constantly swirling world.  don’t get me wrong i’m not complaining about my swirls.  i create them, i encourage them, i like them.  but there is a side of me that likes sameness.  it is that side that i passify when i walk into the yoga studio.  it is why i do bikram yoga.  he is known as mcYoga and i know that i can walk into one of his studios in boulder, austin, NYC, key west or nashville and it will be the same series.  it is my sameness that i like.  

i think that the woman who owns the studio here discounts that.  her view is that yoga should be like life, constantly flowing and constantly changing, and humans should learn to relax and go with the flow.  i understand that view.  especially from her perspective where the studio is her life.  the studio is not my life, it is my harbor from my life.  i get annoyed when she changes things unilaterally without even telling us so that we can chose differently.  my favorite teacher there is the metronome woman.  she keeps us in poses for the same amount of time each time, ,she starts on time, she finishes on time, she doesn’t do different poses "just for fun."  i love her.  she inherently understands why I come to yoga.  this philosophical alignment makes for a better class.  when i can relax my mind i can relax my body.  if you make me think then i cannot relax my body as much.  

i have three rules and after i do a few warm-up stretches i say a little mantra to myself while i lay down with my eyes closed and the little japanese music playing.  

rule number 1: feed, don’t fight.  it is imperative to not fight the energy in the room, don’t fight the teacher, even if you don’t like what she is doing, don’t fight the people in the room.  feed off of their insecurities, off their figetting, off their yogic energy, feed off the energy in the room.  feed, don’t fight.

rule number 2: you are an amateur.  yoga is a process, it is not a destination.  don’t think that you are going to get there today.  it is ok to not go all out.  it is ok that you don’t go as far as she does.  it is ok that you don’t go as far as you did yesterday.  yoga is a practice, it is immeasurable.  release yourself and enjoy it.  you are an amateur.

rule number 3: go deep.  go deep into your mind.  enjoy what is inside.  don’t worry about what is around you.  don’t worry what is being said.  don’t worry what others are doing.  go deep into your body.  feel your way into poses.  feel your way inside poses.  feel your way out of poses.  don’t look, feel.  go deep.

i say that mantra every single time.  almost word for word, to myself as i lay there.  

THAT is why i go to yoga….that, and i’m a dirty fucking hippie.
