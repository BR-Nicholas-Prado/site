I am sad to [see Bill Richardson drop out ][1]of [the Presidential Race][2].  He has had my support for a long time because of his int’l credentials; his moderate but competent domestic policies; and most of all his realism.

Now I hope that he gets onto the backs of one of the two major campaigns, and by one I mean the right one for my target age bracket!

In other political news, NYT has a grand article about what [Dean wants to attack McCain on][4].  Very good journalism I say.
