![190207_1921][1]i hate malls. i really really hate everything about them. i hate how large they are. i hate that massive retention ponds must be created to pool the flow of water that is not allowed to seep into the ground properly over a dissipated region, but is instead pooled in isolated areas. the outsourcing of the environmental degredation annoys me. i hate how they all are the same, one or two paradigms determine the layout. i hate the food they sell. i hate that they are owned by all of us who own mutual funds and don’t really care where our money goes to except for the fact that we get something towards our retirement golf community dream.

 but malls in africa are different. there are two markets in freetown. i have written about those earlier. i guess what i’m describing in this post is more like the grocery store. but, for the most part, everything that my soap boxing deals with is applicable to grocery stores. except for the fact that i do, in fact, go to those without bitching and moaning like a child who doesn’t want to go ski. 

almost every evening i walk out the gate of my compound and down the dirt road towards king street.  sitting along this road is lance.  he sits in his second story balcony looking out onto frazier-davies dr (which is the dirt road, off king street). usually if i go early they are praying, his building is sort of an all-purpose store, mosque, residence.  it is odd that lance is rarely not outside.  when it is dark it is even more odd, b/c he will just be sitting there.  i often wonder what old lance is thinking about.  regardless, he is always friendly to me.

[![240207_1659][3]][3]king street is narrow and fairly steep. when two cars pass each other, you want to have nothing to do with that. the ditches are deep on either side of king street and sidewalks are a luxury that only the cotton tree foundation (some sort of an educational NGO, but i personally think is a front for some tax right-off from the developed world as it is the nicest house on king street but none of my guards or the locals that i now know in the area have seen anyone going into the cotton tree foundation complex…they also keep it lit up like a beacon of misplaced hope at night, which is pleasant for me as there are no street lights on king street.) can afford.

the tenuous part is not only the fact that the ditches are really quite deep and filled with sewage, but also the fact that when it is really dark and the taxicab drivers are incompetant and always have their brights on, so the effect is that your night vision is constantly getting fucked with and when you look down to see where the ditch has gone to now you cannot see your feet b/c the rods and cones are dazzled by the brilliance of the taxicab driver’s incompetence.  

[![240207_1701][4]][4]king street is steep, but not too bad. if you make it down to the bottom (~300 meters) you reach congo cross.  congo cross is the marker by which we tell all cabbies how to get us home.  everyone knows it.  during the freetown invasion of 1999 the bridge over the congo river was the demarcation line where the nigerian troops that were ostensibly defending the democratically elected government (for better or worse) made their stand.  most things west of that bridge stayed relatively safe (save for some minor insurgent activity), and east of that bridge it was completely and utterly fucked.

 in utter freetown style, however, the congo cross roundabout which everyone knows as congo cross is a mile from where the bridge actually goes over the bridge.  the roundabout has some creepy statute on it, which i’ll have a pict for you shortly.  it is also the worst designed roundabout i’ve seen in a long time.  i think they may have imported the DC urban planners to create that flippin’ round about.  traffic is continually congested along king street heading down towards congo cross (see first pict) and if i head home on the seven o’clock transport (which, lately, has been more rare) when i walk down king street there is a line of polio victims asking for "small, small."  usually i have a little something, but more usually when i return i give them something tangible, like bread or fish.  

 [![240207_1703][5]][5]congo cross is a festival of sounds. people yelling, cops "directing traffic" (which is really an excuse to get the cabbies to give them money), whistles, horns, beeps of the pimped out cabs and "poda poda’s" (more about this freaks later), kids running around and laughing, usually people are singing in one of the seven churches that are within earshot of the roundabout.

i usually start by going all the way across the roundabout to bah the egg man, usually i have to spend a few minutes joking with his friends ibrahim and cherry pie (my nickname for a name that i cannot pronounce, plus the day i first met him he was wearing a red shirt, and he hates the nickname, becuase it sounds too effiminate to him…therefore i continually do it…often time accompanied by a little rendition of the song). from bah i buy most of the staples, eggs, crackers, bisquits (the british version, not the southan version), etc.  then i start working my way up the street to the left.

 next stop is aunty may who sells me my grapefruits and mangos.  she likes to try to stiff me, jokingly giving me half my change and then pretending to walk away. she turns around, however, too early…this is b/c she is old and only has enough energy to take the joke so far.  she is always one of the most appreciative traders about the fact that i come down with my own bag and i don’t need a "plastic."  

[![240207_1704][6]][6]next stop is usually alex, the bread man.  the bread here is really good, but you have to buy it fresh as they don’t use any preservatives, so at most they will keep fresh for a day or 36 hours from when i buy them.  though younger than i, alex has a gigantic tumor on the side of his head.  it looks like a portobello mushroom growing out of his right cheek.  i’m not sure what it is, but when joe comes (another story entirely, but JOE IS COMING…end of may) i’ll introduce them. maybe, but doubtfully, there is something joe could do for him. jared, likely could do something for him, being that jared is a face surgeon and all, but not sure jared can or would want to come.  alex is a quiet man who unfortunately has his stall sited at the end of the row of traders. not sure why i started buying bread from him, but i like him and whenever the others try to sell to me, i just shake my head…by now they know not to even ask.  i’m loyal to ole’ alex…

[![240207_1705][7]][7]after alex i have one more stop. the kwality store (yes, it is spelled phonetically). the kwality store is run by mohammed, who is a lebanese. there is a lebanese mafia around here that runs most of the high level trading (which is why i prefer to do as much shopping at the local stalls as i can, and only like to go to the real grocery stores for things i cannot buy at the stalls, like cheese and pasta and decent shampoo…this way my money stays in the country AND doesn’t fund hezbollah). i’m ok buying from mohammed though because he just has a small store, not gigantic.  from mohammed i buy any canned goods i need (especially tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, which aren’t as good out of the can, but won’t give me typhoid) and bottles of water and sodas.  every night i buy my gaurds sodas. prince likes "GinGA BEEr" which he nearly screams, because he get so excited about it. prince likes these strawberry shake things. ibrahim and francis are boring and take cokes.

after that then i trudge up king street loaded down with the day’s worth of groceries and happy. i love talking to the people. i love the way at first they were confused about this white boy who actually walks around, but now they are getting used to my visits. i love how the people that aren’t used to me like to call me "white boy" and i say, "wow, you are quite observant" and then the people that do know me laugh….see mom…sarcasm IS the international language!  when i get up to the white international school sign (see pict 5) and take a left i’m usually sweaty and itchy (there are so many toxins in the air that whenever my pores open i get a bit itchy). b/c there is no air in the kitchen by the time i finish cooking and eating i may have stopped sweating….but not always.

i work now.
