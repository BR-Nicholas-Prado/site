Keep an eye on this!

Last week [Jacob Zuma was elected as head of ANC.][2]  He won this election over the sitting president, Thabo Mbeki, who he has had troubles with in the past.  Zuma used to be Mbeki’s vice, but was fired in 2005.  Last week he has wrested the leadership of the ANC from him after a very acrimonious campaign for the leadership of Nelson’s party.  So today, BBC reports that there are rumors that Zuma will be [indicted on corruption charges][3].

Love of corruption is the root of all evil in my eyes, but I’m conflicted here.  Maybe he did it, in which case then things need to be reevaluated.  Maybe there should be a new election for head of ANC.  But even if he did, and there was a prosecutorial decision in 2005 not to prosecute him, then it just feels like blackmail.  

There are many interesting political dimensions to this.  One is that South Africa is looked up to throughout most of Africa as the (relative) bastion of good governance (see, e.g., [this][4]) in the same way that Nigeria is held up as the bastion of what not to do (see, e.g., [this][5]).  At least for the Anglophone countries this largely appears to be the case.  But South Africa’s importance goes way beyond simply an example, it is THE key to all of Southern Africa, if not most of sub-saharan Africa.  Despite Nigeria’s desires, the key regional powers in the AU from the sub-saharan countries are: well, South Africa, and to a lesser extent Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria.

The 2010 World Cup is to be held in South Africa and is thought of widely as a way to focus attention on Africa in a very positive light for the first time in a long time.  The entire continent seemingly feels ownership over these games in a way that could not be the case if they were elsewhere – in the developed world.  So, what happens if the next year and a half goes badly politically for South Africa?  The entire continent may suffer from a failed opportunity.

Maybe I’m making more of this than is really here.  If the ANC does implode because of an internal power struggle, maybe that shifts the domestic political dynamics but does not really affect the status of the country.  Like, I say, keep an eye on it.
