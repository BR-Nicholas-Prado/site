today i gave myself a sabatical.  all football, all day.  it was fantastic.  just finished up watching PRIMETIME.  visions of big dog nachos dancing in my head.

apparently we have a mouse in the house (literally).  this will be interesting as i’ve never set mousetraps and had them smash a little fucking rodent and then (worse of all) have to take that diseased fucker down to the trash.  ray lewis just hugged some army dudes.  i can’t tell if that is a class act or not.  my default is yes, my second thought is it is a stunt.  whatever.

that is about all i have to say.  just working at school stuff.  hanging out with yale-y. 

last night eric, anthony, yale-y and some other people and i went to see frank black.  he did a solo set on cannery row.  he played for about 45 minutes or so.  it was fantastic, small, intimate, all that shit.  i only knew a few of the songs.

lee greenwood is giving hte national anthem….huh?  that emotional sellout from the first gulf war…?  wacky.
