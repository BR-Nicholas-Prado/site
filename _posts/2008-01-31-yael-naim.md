So, if you like the new commercials for Air Jordan’s, I mean [Mac Air ][1]then you likely have wondered who the hell is singing that song and why does it make me so happy.  Well the answer is [Yael Naim][2] to the first question, the song is New Soul.  Apparently she is French, cause the rest of her self-titled album is in French, and there is a song titled Paris.  The answer to the second question, at least for me, is that it makes me want to go to happy things.  It begins an entire stream of day dreaming which inevitably ends somewhere happy.  Not sure what your answer will be.  Her video for the song is below.
