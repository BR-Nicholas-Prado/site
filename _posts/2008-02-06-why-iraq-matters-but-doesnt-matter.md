During the last debate, I was talking with Super-Star about Iraq.  The following is my analysis of the situation.

Iraq matters – a lot to voters.  But Iraq shouldn’t matter.  No matter what the candidates say to pander to their base each of them is going to do virtually identical things on Iraq.  Iraq is complicated, but it isn’t that complicated.  We know what we need to do now, that is clear.  Despite pleas to "End the War" that is essentially an ephemeral campaign promise.  

Sweet.  We’re going to the Situation Room.

Anyway.  The reason that they will all do the same thing but be able to say completely different things is because of the nuances.  They are simply talking the nuances, but this is how it will most likely play out.

There is a terrorist threat in Iraq.  We knew that the time that they would be coming for us.  To me, at the time when we were invading this was the most convincing argument.  I’ve said before, I’ll say again that although it doesn’t really justify the war in my mind, at least I was happy to go there to provide the fly trap.  

Now, I have problems with that, because whereever there is fighting there is collateral damage and now Sunnis in Western Iraq are paying the price for the neocon idea of better over there than here.  

Now that there is a terrorist threat, we need to keep fighting them there.  Al Qaeda is sending its best fighters into the loosely populated areas of Western Iraq.  Those missions that the young Marines are carrying out in the western deserts are vital to our national security, because those fighters do have backing that enables a long enough reach to threaten vital interests.

This is the point that Republicans play up and Democrats gloss over.  Neither Obama nor Hillary nor McCain nor anyone (except maybe Ron Paul) is going to stop the terrorist hunting missions in the West.  

Baghdad.  Located in the virtual geographic center of the country Baghdad is a conundrum.  It is as close as a melting pot as Iraq has, and certainly one of the more cosmopolitan centers east of Jordan.  What happens there is connected to what is happening in the West, but only loosely.  They inform one another, but there is little tight causal connection.  What is happening in Baghdad is tribal tensions that have built up over millennium colliding with the realities of politics colliding with patronage networks that require bolstering or maintenance.  The issues there are raw political ones that happen in any post-conflict scenario.  

Some of the bombings are to get power in the parliament; some of the bombings are organized crime who is fighting other organized crime for territory; some of the bombings are terrorist and ideological based; and I’m sure that other bombings are the same.  So not all the bombs that get reported are the same.  Yes, the bombings have reduced.  That is because the surge is working.  At least it is working in Baghdad, where it needed to work because that is the center of gravity for Iraq and it must retain some modicum of stability if Iraq is going to be able to figure out how to solve its other problems.  Rumsfeld was just as wrong as he was right.  A small elite force could topple Saddam’s regime.  We did it beautifully.  But without any planning, without enough troops, without sufficient oversight of general’s things soon spiraled out of control.  The only way to regain momentum and control in Baghdad was to flood the streets with soldiers.  That reduces the capability of insurgents and organized crime and backhanded, violent political operative’s ability to operate.  This is what is causing the reduction in violence.

The solution here must be resolved by the Iraqis.  They need to be forced into political reconciliation.  They need to be forced into policing organized crime.  They need to take the lead on rooting out the insurgents that escape our corridor around the Western Desert area.  We need to help them in all this, but this has to Iraqi driven, the US can only do so much.

This is the aspect of Iraq that the Democrats play up and the Republicans glaze over.  Both parties are going to keep significant numbers of troops in Baghdad for a set period of time and then force the Iraqis into figuring it out.  At the end of this set period we are going to begin to draw down our troop structure.  When Iraqis begin taking over Baghdad we will see significant reductions in troop strengths.  But no one is going to pull the Marines out of western Iraq.  Not for a while yet.  

The rest of Iraq.  The rest of Iraq is just as nuanced.  Drugs, Crime, Terrorists, all of these will seep across the borders, making it easier for them to come to Europe.  The Europeans don’t want that.  We don’t want that.  The provincial solution is to help the Iraqi’s secure their borders.  We are doing this to a certain extent and for the most part will continue to do this.  I see little change here.

So at the end of the day Cut And Run = 100 Years in Iraq = Retreat in Defeat.  At the end of the day they are all realists and are all going to do the same thing.
