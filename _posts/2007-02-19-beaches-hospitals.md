[ ![Imgp1261_edited1][2]][2] This series of pictures is from the beach this weekend.  For a long time I have considered the statement: it has the best beaches in the world, or at least in 
Africa

.  I would hedge for a couple of reasons.  The first is that, of course, I’m not stranger to beaches.  Something would be hard-pressed to pass up the beach on the Navy Base in 
Key West

or the beach near Sunshine Key or 1000 Steps in 
California

.  The second is that, I’m not even sure what that phrase means.  Usually I hate getting wrapped around minor semantical differences.  I really am not bagging on the verbiage choices, what I mean is that I don’t understand how one could even make the claim?  What would one base it upon?  Sand/Surf/Beer/People/No-People/Views?  



[![Imgp1265][3]][3] It is amorphous, because each of these things seemingly has an ideal on the spectrum that a beach, were it personified in a blog, should strive for.  White, sandy beaches. Clear Water.  Consistent good weather.  But there are other categories which the ideal cannot as easily be classified.  It depends on whether one wants people around or deserted in order to classify an ideal.  It depends on whether one wants a bar and restaurant on the beach or not in order to classify an ideal.  Nevertheless this beach was pretty damn kool.  Around the corner from where this picture runs out was a little lagoon that was gorgeous.  I went around the corner and there was a woman walking topless with her back to me.  I turned around to be polite and as I was turning saw her boyfriend.  I felt bad for interrupting their quiet time.  



[![Imgp1267][4]][4]So I went and played among the rocks that you can see at the far left of this photo, all the while singing a Jimmy Buffett song, "I’m a tidal pool explorer….from the days of my mis-spent youth…."  After I saw them returning to the main area of the beach I went to explore.  I saw a hut with a grass roof that was not built by Disney for ambiance but was really functional.



These two little girls were very cute.  They came and sat next to us for a while and just looked at us.  Later we asked them what they were doing, etc.  They wanted our beer cans so they could melt them down into pots for cooking.  It was the second time this past week that I was asked for cans in order to melt them down for a pot.  A friend was wondering if it is a smart thing to melt these down for pots, wouldn’t one get poisoned slowly with all the additives in the aluminum cans.  I replied that here they likely crave things that can kill you slowly, b/c there are so many that can kill you quickly. 



[![Imgp1273][5]][5]For one thing we were the only white people on the beach (or as the locals pronounce it: BEEtch, which half the time I think they are calling me a bitch, a nice repose from the normal honky or white boy accompanied by a hissing sound that here is equivalent to hey, or excuse me, or a wave in america).  For another thing the water was clean and the surf made swimming a joy.  I think that the salinity of the water here seems different, at times it seems more salty and at others less salty.  Likely this is just a perception thing.  



[![Imgp1272][6]][6]The [area around Freetown][6] is a peninsula.  We have been going to the series of beaches that is along the southern part of the peninsula for a while now.  We went to the closest one first and have been working our way out further and further.  This week we went to Kent, Sierra Leone which was the farthest out.  It was the end of the line so to speak.  Our systematic beach-ride-mooching has left one beach yet to visit.  Likely we will go there next weekend.  That beach is the most famous beach in all of Sierra Leone, River Number Two.  We’ll have a review for you soon.



[![Imgp1279][8]][8]S/L still has the lowest life expectancy of any country in the world.  Mainly this stems from much of the country having very little access to healthcare in much of the country.  Even in Freetown access is extremely limited for much of the population.  Although people can get themselves or their unhealthy loved one to the clinic, there are major issues with the cost of health care in this country.  For instance, I am concerned that if I get sick it will blow my entire budget.  I have heard unconfirmed reports that a night in the Chinese run hospital will cost around $300.  Now, i’m not living on a complete shoe string here, but without real health insurance getting typhoid and getting laid up in a hospital for three nights like one friend did could be disasterous.  Think about the person who lives on $80 a month.  



[![Imgp1266][9]][9] On top of the cost is the actual care given.  There is no level one trama facility in the entire country.  So GWB can forget about coming.  



We have a friend, Sam, who is the executive director for a coalition of faith-based health clinics throughout the country.  He has told me that in order for this country to "develop" (whatever that means will depend on one’s perspective) it has to have better access to health-care.  Duh.  But I’m not really sure how you do it.  The problems extend from the infrastructure to the care-givers (who I’m told generally cannot be bothered to help sick people) to the cost and the web grows from there.  But maybe it is low on the government’s wishlist, it seems that when you cannot get any power through the lines to your capital city maybe the people’s political platform is slightly skewed.



So if you have medical skills and want to make a massive impact, come visit Sam…he’ll put you to work!
