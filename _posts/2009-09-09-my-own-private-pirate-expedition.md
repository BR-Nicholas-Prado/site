I am trying to return to some modicum of consistency with respect to the exhibitionist nature of this activity.

In that vein, let me tell you of our next few days.  Our roommates (there are a total of five of us, which will constrict to three within a matter of weeks) and Leigh and I will be heading off to “train” the Coast Guard.  Actually, we won’t be doing any training, but Scuba Steve will be training the Coast Guard on boat handling techniques (for their one cutter) and diving techniques (still unsure re: this one).  

A while ago we bought a Pirate flag as a joke when we were in Scotland.  I am hoping to fly this from the cutter as we are zooming along.  There is this corner, near Djib, of S-land that Leigh and I have always wanted to visit.  It is apparently one of the most beautiful parts of this country.  There are two major islands off the coast, where Muslim missionaries first crossed from the peninsula into Africa.  There is an ancient ruin of the mosque they used on the one island where we are hoping to camp.  Also there will likely be sea turtles and whale sharks, and some of the best reef diving in the world.  As my roommates are similiar to my family – which is to say nuts about photos – I’m sure there will be numerous photos for posting afterwards.  

We are hoping that the cruise will contain a short diversion up to Djib where we can acquire wines and other select items not available in our locale.  The S-land Coast Guard are having some sort of a meet and greet with the Djib Navy, so that should be interesting to be a part of.  

The pirates shouldn’t be too much of a concern.  I will be posting myself with binos on the bow gatling for much of the trip, or at least for a few photos.  Plus the closer to Djib, where the anti-piracy fleet is “stationed,” one gets the safer one becomes.  

We should be completely out of contact from Thursday until Monday.  After that, inshallah, there will be tons of stories of nuts adventures.

We are hoping to see T-Pain somewhere along the way….
