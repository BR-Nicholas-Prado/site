Link: [The dumbest debate in America][1].  The Guardian has a great op-ed which I think summarizes exactly how I felt about the debate last night.  The crux of the matter boils down to this very well crafted sentence.

> When a presidential debate in a nation roiled by two wars, an economic  
> crisis and a seven-year onslaught on civil liberties revolves around  
> questions about flag pins and casual friends, it would be easy to  
> despair.

That is all for now.
