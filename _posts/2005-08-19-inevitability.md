# 

so tonight it happened.  i had been dreading it happening, in fact it was one of the main reasons i had for not wanting to move to nashville.  but nonetheless it happened.  on the way to a bar to meet some new "friends" i ran into katie’s parents.

it fucked my whole dope up and only ended up staying at the bar for a little while b/c i couldn’t concentrate on anything people were saying and couldn’t respond in anything approaching wit.

tomorrow i’ll be better, but for tonight…..shit
