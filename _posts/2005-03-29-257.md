i feel sated. a snake on a warm spring afternoon curled on a sandstone deposit, belly full of mouse, jaw reattached, water near, people and mongeese far.

have finalized summer plans, spring plans and other assorted plans.  will be diving into jamaica for 4/20 even though i’m not a pothead and don’t intend to become one.  its just an anthropological experiment, like so much of the rest of my life.  extended out my lease here through august.  

the train keeps turning its wheels.
