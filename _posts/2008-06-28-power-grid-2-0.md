[Here][1] is a good article about updating the power grid in the US.

This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while.  One of the problems when we finally & slowly switch over to a more eco-friendly method of electricity generation is that the power grid will have to substantially change from a few precise nodes in a system to many dispersed nodes in the system.  It is going to have to be decentralized.  Another thing that likely will have to change also is how power is stored and delivered.  Hopefully some solid state power cells can be developed.  The exciting thing is that if that were to happen then much of the world that is in the sunbelt will be able to develop power and charge solid-state devices.  If the transportation networks can support it then places that currently have little natural resources except for sun, wind or waves will be able to develop electricity for the north which has less sunlight but is able to pay for their energy in a way that the sunbelt is not.  However, this is unlikely to happen for a long time due to the lack of effective tech-transfer, despite such provisions being written into every major environmental treaty.  

OK off to my day.
