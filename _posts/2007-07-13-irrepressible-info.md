# 

this is a fantastic idea which i actually wrote about in a paper.  amnesty and an IT company have formed an ngo titled [irrepressible.info][1] which takes content that is banned categorically and decentralized it onto other people’s blogs.  that way countries which have categorical firewalls which block user’s ability to visit certain pages (e.g. HRW, AI, etc.) are enabled to see the content.  way to go technology.  in other news i’m figuring out how to put code onto my blog…
