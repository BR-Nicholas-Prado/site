[![Dirtypr1][2]][2] the other week, i mean tuesday, we watched [dirty pretty things][2] at the expat hangout which i cannot decide whether i like or not.  it does have a real dartboard. and chicken wing sauce which is nice to dip fries in. and a real greek salad with kalamatas, and real feta cheese, and herbs and a nice dressing. i have dreams about the greek salad and the sauce, but not together b/c that would be just weird. yet, there aren’t any locals there, and it is expensive. and i feel wierdly priveleged when i walk in there. whatever.

the movie was interesting, although bit melodramatic in its ending.  it was about illegal immigrants in britain and the faustian bargains they are forced to seal.  it is worth a view….for a british flick.
