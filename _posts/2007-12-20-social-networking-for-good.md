excerpt: "So, I’m not really sure what good can come about by 'friending' on MySpace a bunch of organizations that do good work.  I guess on one level it warms the heart of the friender, knowing that they are on the in with these organizations.  I guess it can also bolster the 'rolls' of the friendee, something that poli_sci has consistently told me is key to grassroots organizing as the bigger the rolls the more money they can potentially raise by leveraging that list to similar organizations that need to get a hold of similar people or from foundations who use the rolls as a proxy for the amount of good the organization will be able to accomplish (similar to a business plan for a small-business loan the grant writing proposal (apparently) can swing for or against often times based upon the size of the roll like the amount of the small-business owner’s money that is already invested in the business). "

So, I’m not really sure what good can come about by "friending" on MySpace a bunch of organizations that do good work.  I guess on one level it warms the heart of the friender, knowing that they are on the in with these organizations.  I guess it can also bolster the "rolls" of the friendee, something that poli_sci has consistently told me is key to grassroots organizing as the bigger the rolls the more money they can potentially raise by leveraging that list to similar organizations that need to get a hold of similar people or from foundations who use the rolls as a proxy for the amount of good the organization will be able to accomplish (similar to a business plan for a small-business loan the grant writing proposal (apparently) can swing for or against often times based upon the size of the roll like the amount of the small-business owner’s money that is already invested in the business).  
It seems, to me, that the other thing that is happening is that it keeps my bookmarks clean.  Anally retentive people’s ears perk up at this.  I can just go to mySpace and find out about organizations rather than having to open each in a separate tab in my firefox browser (i find it amusing that the firefox browser tags itself as a misspelled word).  
Have just seen the MySpace Impact Awards.  Apparently MySpace gives these away every quarter, or month or something.  It is a $10k grant, but more importantly (for most organizations) is the free advertising that MySpace will deliver to its 40Zillion users.  The criteria for winning are supposedly: 
> The Committee will select three (3) finalists from all entries eligible  
> for the Grand Prize that are received during the Contest Submission  
> Period based on the discretion of each of the judges, based on the  
> following judging criteria (the “Judging Criteria”):  25% relevance to  
> the month’s category, 25% use of MySpace toolset to promote the cause  
> (i.e. good profile design, incorporating multi-media, active engagement  
> with the MySpace community, etc.), 25% breadth of reach and appeal, and  
> 25% fit with the culture of MySpace.
I included the criteria because it is interesting how subjective it all is.  Hipsters judging hipsters.  Nevertheless.  They have six main categories, they seem to rotate every month or quarter whenever the award is given:

Find something you care about, get involved.  Do some good.
