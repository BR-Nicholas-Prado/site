impressions of an evening in aspen.

clothes too poor in room of quadrillionaires.sushi left out too long.white wine somehow too crisp.is this a date or am i a seat filler.snow.headlights.crowds like the sand in the middle of the antique watch.

youngster.hipster.mullato.piano.hands upright.were those wrists slapped by an old lady with a ruler.noise pierces through cacophony that i’m unable to locate.ensembles are like cocktail parties.wallflower with my wine, against the wall.

old crew.easy.at ease.peaceful in their existence.stage lights reflecting off the guitarists cufflinks directly into my eyes.contrasting hands of two bassists, one sinewy, one porky.largest elf i’ve ever seen onto stage, sits behind piano, shoulderless, on heroin.heroine.everyone bites their lip in their own way.

jazz, the balance of existence within a void.
