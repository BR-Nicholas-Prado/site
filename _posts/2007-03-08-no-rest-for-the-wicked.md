# 

so i’ve worked twenty-three of the last twenty-five days. average day length: 12 hours. average number of documents per day: varies. this week have not left the office before midnight, except for meals. likely this time will creap later and later as we approach our deadline.

i asked my magic eight ball when i can expect some time off, it replied: the outlook is not good.

so much for my theory that no one works as hard as americans, and therefore i won’t be working that hard in africa. well, maybe the theory is still intact, but i’m working FOR americans. damn it.

like my officemate and i keep telling each other, to buoy our morale….international justice waits for NO ONE…!
