Maybe that is a bit provocative.  Maybe it is ipso facto.  I don't know.  And we'll have to see.

I remember being maybe 5 or 6 and either watching this show, or at least the trailer for a show about life after the Soviets invaded America and took over.  It was the type of propoganda that I have to suspect most of those who spent more time in the Cold War than I were constantly subjected to.  Over the years I have read or heard various references either to this show specifically or to the genre generally.  Mostly these have been referenced by pop culture historians and the like.  It all seemed a bit far-fetched to me.  I remember thinking at the time of seeing the show or trailer, how could such a thing actually happen.  The mechanisms for how it happened just did not compute.  After the thought, though, I constructed for days a novel in my head about a young boy who frustrates the Soveit's attempts to actually get a foothold in Orlando.  Essentially I was the young Che in my mind.  I largely constructed this dream world while in a tree behind my Aunt's house who I went to every afternoon following school.  It may seem odd that the failure of the bailout to pass brings up such a memory for me, but trust me it's not as random as it seems.

It has been argued to me that there is enough liquid capital in the US economy to absorb the losses from the failed banks that the bailout was designed to absorb.  Although I have no hard evidence to backup my thinking, I have not been so sure.  It seems to me that the only viable financial institutions will be hoarding cash like a suburban mother buying cans for her bomb shelter during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  OK, I accept that Citi today finalized the deal for Wachovia, but perhaps they needed Wachovia's deposits to bolster their cash and were willing to absorb the liabilities on Wachovia's accounts, which when compared to Citi's must be miniscule.  So it seems to me that it was a short term tactic design to enhance their available cash.  Many of the bundled mortgages and other default credit swap items do not come ready packaged with a large amount of cash, however.  So I am not so sure that there will be an entity within the US economy capable of purchasing those at anything approaching market value.  

In many cases the financial industry would likely reach across the Atlantic.  But no one in Europe is willing to help.  First, they've all been burned by this nearly as bad as we have.  Secondly, they've got their own massive problems now with the Brit's having to broker numerous deals to bolster their banks (for the why, see 1).  Could we eat our pride and reach across the Pacific?  Maybe, Japan has already bought one of the failing banks (or a major piece I cannot remember and am too lazy to find a link).  

We will have to see what happens.  In my mind China's central bankers will wake up tomorrow and it will be Chinese Christmas for them.  They are likely the only ones that have enough liquid capital to do anything about this.  I have a distinct feeling that American's who didn't want the American government to own their homes may have a distinctly different feeling when they wake up and realize that the only people able to buy our mortgages are the Chinese sovereign wealth fund or one of the few tightly controlled Chinese banks.  

The real game changer, and why I am wondering whether in fifty years historians will pinpoint this day, is that this demonstrates once and for all the end of the dreams, hopes, fears of any continuation of American hegemony within the international community.  Military prowess?  Lost about the summer of 2005.  Moral authority?  Lost about the same time.  Ability to communicate?  Lost about January 2001.  Economic superiority?  Will it be lost?  I don't know.  But suspect that yes, yes it will.  American greed has driven the world's economy since about the mid-90s.  But what happens when American greed turns into American begging?  Don't know.  I will admit that this reads a bit doomsdayish, but I am not thinking that it will play any other way.  They will all blame us for their inevitable economic slow downs, but they will laugh at ours as it will likely be worse than theirs.  After those corrections the only ones left standing will likely be the Asians who had enough foresight and financial education to save relentlessly and not overextend their lines of credit and are now laughing at the stupid Americans that bought their goods (we and) they couldn't afford for so long.  But now they can afford their own goods.  And soon, we will not be able to.  So that is one observation.  

Another is reading the Roll Call analysis from the House vote is pretty amazing.  Sure Pelosi gave her speech.  Whatever.  Sure D 60-40 Y; R 33-67 Y.  That isn't what I think is interesting.  The statistic that is more interesting is this one (when combined with the last).  Of those House seats where the incumbent is in a tight race, only 21% voted Y.  Now combine that with the first and you have an imperfect estimate that more Republicans are in tight races than Democrats.  In other words the GOP is in more of a precarious position than I actually thought.  

There is some fundamental disconnect here that I admittedly do not understand.  As of earlier today the polls showed that only 11% of the public wanted the government to do nothing.  These ultimate free marketeers would reflect my general perception of how much of a percentage those types of people likely occupy in the American polity.  So that number made sense to me.  But what doesn't make sense is how that 11% was able to get what it wanted.  That is not to say the Bill is dead, but it is certainly in a coma on life support as it wasn't a narrow no.  It was a bipartisan, resounding No.  OK, fine.  But if this whole thing was negotiated by the leadership of both parties, what were the whips doing all weekend?  And I have no idea what the way forward is.

I skimmed about half of the Bill during my lunch break today.  It seemed, well, not great, but not awful.  Obviously, the most vital part of the Bill is the power for Treasury to pay the principle and interest on the bank's Treasury deposits, which allows the banks to right off those bills for the time being and use their cash on hand for operating expenses.  This is a backhanded way for the Treasury to sink a ton of cash into the system without incurring inflationary pressures that seignurage normally requires.  That was the core of the Bill as far as getting the Banks to resume lending to one another, which is what is needed as far as corporations are concerned.  The other core of the Bill was the purchasing of the assets of institutions nearing failure or already failed.  This is where the government would own your home.  In my mind there were seemingly gigantic problems with that section.  Especially with the valuation as the Treasury was requried to purchase assets, but the valuation of the assets was not established by any sort of mechanism other than what the Treasury was thinking they were worth.  I thought how in hell does Treasury know what they are worth, especially the bundled assets.  The answer is that they do not and really have little ability to find out other than what the seller is asking.  This creates a seller's market.  Perhaps that was the intention.  Give the financial institutions a bit of a windfall, which creates incentives for iBankers not to take themselves and everything they own out of the system and move to their land in Montana to open up a free-range cattle ranch.  Perhaps it was not the intention and one of the re  
asons the bill failed.  However, I see no other way to valuate the assets and am not sure what Congress and Paulson could have done.  

My main nervousness with the Bill was that it gave Treasury an insane amount of discretionary space.  Again, I see no other options so Congress was likely caught in a Catch-22 on that one.  The executive already has a massive amount of discretionary authority when it comes to economic policy in this country.  The Bill as drafted would have given the executive even more.  Although this is nice for Bushites who love the unitary executive theory, those of us who have a different philosophical conception of separation of powers may be concerned.  Certainly I was.  And still am.  As I think more and more about it, largely that concern is academic.  One major windfall for me is that the dollar's value is screaming through the roof as everyone clammers for cash-based assets.  This means the place Highlands and I want to buy in Edinburgh is getting cheaper by the Bush screwup.  Thanks buddy.

One last thought and then am off to bed.  How will this play on Thursday night?  Am interested to see.  Likely Palin will play the "it's people like you in Washington that don't care about the American public" card.  He won't, but I wish Biden would play the "it's people like the idiots from your small town you love so much that got us into this mess by, like you, not understand a single damn thing about economics or finances" card.  

Still hoping for if anything is passed we get some nice earmarks for mandatory financial literacy at the high school level…..

Update: McCain's campaign just called to inform me that earmarks are the anti-Christ and I should not reference them anywhere.  How did they know that I typed that as I haven't posted this yet?
