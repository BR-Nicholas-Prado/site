Because I am intellectually inferior and do not have so much time, I have few unique thoughts.  

There is some great analysis on the web about the short conflict.  

[NYT ][1]has a great article on the tactics used by the Russians.  I, for one, am not scared by the Russian's ability to employ combined arms in the same manner that we are.  They simply do not have the culture that relies on decentralization necessary to affect true combine arms warfare in the way that we employ CA.

[FP Passport][2] has an interesting article about the incitement of the conflict.  I think that it is fairly evenhanded account and I largely agree with the analysis, from what I know of things…which is limited!

The most militarily and culturally interesting point about the conflict is the [absence ][3]or [presence ][4]of cyberwar.  The big takeaway is that the Pentagon should not wash its hands of the R&D and of the C3 and of the practitioners responsible for employing and defending against these attacks.  Its rhetoric aside, I would not be surprised if they had, nor if they hadn't.  No matter what has been done, moving forward this is an area prime for research and defining where the battle-space will be and many other questions.
