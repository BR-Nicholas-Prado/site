for much of my childhood i didn’t understand what that phrase was on the  
side of the big, round, blue salt container.  everytime bri and/or i would  
cook i would just look at it and think, "shit isn’t that  
self-evident," or the equivalent of that thought would enter my young mind  
for a pinball session of bouncing around.  eventually i asked my mother  
who told me that this company had placed an additive in the salt that makes it  
pour out in response to older salts that would absorb the humidity in the air  
and clump up in humid environs.  then it made sense.

so lots have changed, but, i think, for the good.  i may be an ass  
hole, but at least i’m being honest to myself.  that may not be a very  
good balm for those around me, but it is all i’ve got.

UPDATE: more things have changed since the last post, which i took down and replaced with this, such as an addition to our community.
