When I was a young Marine Officer, I was in the depths of a dirty used bookstore in DC when this old timer came up to me.  I was in the Military History section trying to find this one book I was supposed to read and we struck up a conversation.  Turns out he had survived Iwo Jima and other battles in the Pacific.  I will always remember the way he slapped me on the back and said with a particular gleam: "Semper Fi, Mac, Semper Fi."  He had served his time, now I’ve served mine.  My contractual commitment ended on New Year’s.  It is odd, in a way I miss having that connection hanging over my head.
