so returning wasn’t nearly as difficult as i thought it would be.  i just hopped in the car and left my paradices.  i might have purposefully made some subconscious hedge by going to jackson first and then leaving the west.  easing my way out of the hot tub by sitting on the side with only your feet in before you race into the house over the snow littered deck….?  not sure.  

only thing is that this week has been vicious.  luckily i when i was called on i was prepared the the guy she called on before me is an idiot so i turned out looking stellar and she didn’t really press me too hard.

in other news, i’ve been thinking a lot about how we all throttle our lives.  many of my friends, the younger ones anyway, don’t really know what is going on with this.  all they have ever known is school where you’re always on, always moving, always going going going.  but it has been a long time for me personally since i was in such an environment (obviously before last august).  i’m not sure how i feel about it.  for one thing it definitely makes the time go by quickly.  this is a post for another chapter, but i thing that my fear of losing out on things lines up here well to create my abject hatred of routines, cause you don’t see things in the same way.  but back to the point, the quickly thing is helpful when you’re not engaged in the most desirous of experiences.  i guess there is something to be said.  maybe not.

mock trial competition preliminaries are this weekend.  grades come out on tuesday.  we’ll just see!
