I have been question what her game is for weeks now.  I have been questioning why the DNC elites don't shut her down.  I have been questioning why there isn't droves and droves of supers to him after the election in a show of party unity.  Some of this has begun.  But why now?  What has changed between yesterday and today that HRC only *now* is "suspending" her campaign.  Further, suspending?  Come on.  Drop out, if something catastrophic were to happen (knocking furiously on wood) then she could still be elected at the convention.  

Have seen a million reasons why the Clinton/Obama ticket will not happen.  Not the least of which is that Bill likely doesn't want the RNC looking too deeply into his sketchy financial dealings over the past few years.  Another theory is that if she really believes that he can't win better for her not to be running mate so as to position for 2012 and "I told you so."  Were he to win, then she would be in the same position whether Veep, Cabinet or Senator.  Jimmy Carter has talked about getting all of the downsides of each rather than all of the upsides of each.  Despite the dystopian overtones, I understand his argument.  I think she gets into a revamped Cabinet.  Along with Edwards, Gore (I hope), and Biden – each in their functional areas of expertise.  That would be a liberal's wet dream cabinet.  Who does that leave?  MY BOY, RICHARDSON, Sebillius, Webb and a few others.  

This is [the email][1] that HRC sent to supporters:

> Dear XXX, 

> I wanted you to be one of the first to know: on Saturday, I will  
> hold an event in Washington D.C. to thank everyone who has supported my  
> campaign. Over the course of the last 16 months, I have been privileged  
> and touched to witness the incredible dedication and sacrifice of so  
> many people working for our campaign. Every minute you put into helping  
> us win, every dollar you gave to keep up the fight meant more to me  
> than I can ever possibly tell you. 

> On Saturday, I will extend my congratulations to Senator Obama and  
> my support for his candidacy. This has been a long and hard-fought  
> campaign, but as I have always said, my differences with Senator Obama  
> are small compared to the differences we have with Senator McCain and  
> the Republicans. 

> I have said throughout the campaign that I would strongly support  
> Senator Obama if he were the Democratic Party's nominee, and I intend  
> to deliver on that promise. 

> When I decided to run for president, I knew exactly why I was  
> getting into this race: to work hard every day for the millions of  
> Americans who need a voice in the White House. 

> I made you — and everyone who supported me — a promise: to stand  
> up for our shared values and to never back down. I'm going to keep that  
> promise today, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life. 

> I will be speaking on Saturday about how together we can rally the  
> party behind Senator Obama. The stakes are too high and the task before  
> us too important to do otherwise. 

> I know as I continue my lifelong work for a stronger America and a  
> better world, I will turn to you for the support, the strength, and the  
> commitment that you have shown me in the past 16 months. And I will  
> always keep faith with the issues and causes that are important to you. 

> In the past few days, you have shown that support once again with  
> hundreds of thousands of messages to the campaign, and again, I am  
> touched by your thoughtfulness and kindness. 

> I can never possibly express my gratitude, so let me say simply, thank you. 

> Sincerely, 

> Hillary Rodham Clinton
