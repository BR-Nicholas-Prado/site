So, am back from Europe and getting into the swing of things.  

Sometimes the internet is an amazing thing.  I have my [RSS Reader][1] set up to automatically search for many things, one of which is for the case that I used to work on.  Usually a bunch of trash comes up when I do my news skim each day since Charles Taylor isn’t the rarest of names and it is difficult to filter out all of the trash although I get most of it.  Nevertheless, today I found out about a surfing movie made in Liberia this summer (which must have been shortly after [Urs and I were there][2]).
