about Russians.  For one they are drunks.  For another they seem to love leaving their country to hang out in the bush and do wild stuff, like fly planes drunk.  

I was talking to our interpreter the other day about the people who fly in the qat from Ethiopia.  They bring them in on small planes, not necessarily because it is illegal, just because that is the infrastructure arrangement.  They also bring them in from the Southern part of S and have to use the planes presumably to avoid the anti-aircraft guns that the TFG and or the UIC may or may not possess.  But most of these planes are flown by former Soviet Union Air Force pilots.  

The stereotype was first formed through movies and books of the rogue Russian pilots who will do anything with their planes.  Here it takes it to a new extreme.  They will pack people into planes so tightly that some will have to stand through entire flights.  They will leave the cockpit to come to the back and dig out seats from the cargo hold of the plane and start reassembling the plane while there are passengers sitting in the compartment.  Because, you know on the last flight they had a load of sheep and had to take out the seats.  They will fly their little planes so drunk that they will miss the runway, land somewhere near it and just walk away from their planes and leave them wherever they landed.  

I have heard all of these stories and have seen glimpses of the stereotypes throughout some of my journeys.  Last night, however, I had my first eye-to-eye experience.  I was in my room and it was a pleasant evening outside.  So I was standing at the window with the screen open enjoying the cool air after a nice thunderstorm.  There are big curtains in my room and they were behind me so I couldn't really see what was happening.  

As I was peacefully enjoying the cool air and quiet I heard the seat of my toilet fall.  Since it was breezy I didn't think anything of it.  Then I heard another bang but didn't think anything of that either.  A few seconds after the noises I see something move out of the corner of my eye.  I was pretty startled and turned around to see a man pulling the blanket back on my bed and sitting down on it.  

At first I was startled, then I was confused.  Was this some sort of a new turn down service that the hotel had instituted?  Did the staff not know I was here (as I was hidden in the curtains) and come in for a quick snooze?  I said, "excuse me…." and came out from behind the curtains.  

The human sitting on my bed looked up drearily and it was a white guy and so wasn't the staff.  I smelled him before I could make out his face, the stench of his boozing preceded him.  

I told the man that he was in the room.  He had his shirt off showing off a massive barrel chest with rock hard stomach (and I don't mean abs….[I love my abdominals….I love my belly….I love my abdominals][1]…this guy loved his food and booze).  He also was barefooted, had a head as big as a lion's, and of course he was wearing blue warm up pants.  AND SITTING ON MY BED.

We began to argue a bit about why he was there.  He got pretty belligerent with me for a bit and then got quite apologetic.  He started to pace around my room and ask me what I had done with his stuff.  I replied that this was my stuff and that he was in my room.  The door to the suite was open and the door to the suite across the hall was open.  I glanced out in the hall and back at him quickly (to make sure that the f-er wasn't going to appropriate any of my stuff) and there was about 18 room service trays in there with tin foil and bowls and cups everywhere.  His TV was on at about 84 trillion decibels.  

During one of his apologetic swings I asked him what his room number was.  He said the room number on the door across the hall, but I could not make him comprehend that the room he was sitting in was not the room that he was given.  During one of his acrimonious swings he told me that he was a great customer here and that this was going to be his room.  I began to think that he wanted to trade rooms rather than just being drunken and disoriented.  During one of his apologetic swings he called down to the front desk, but either it was busy or he hung up on them.  During one of his acrimonious swings he told me that he was a captain and that I should respect him.  

I thought, you're a bit old to be a captain.  I also thought, I'm a Captain too Mother F, now get the hell out of my room.  But despite my belligerent tendencies I belayed my sarcasm.  If you wonder why, *see supra.  *Although he was drunk, he probably had fought a time or two in his life while drunk and, HE WAS HUGE.  

So after ten minutes of me telling him to get out of my room and him telling me to get out of his room and him swinging back and forth between sorry and angry and me thinking about the nice calm cool air outside and him not able to talk English very well and me not able to talk Russian at all, I called down to the front desk and asked them to send someone up.

The nice dudes from downstairs came right up and he listened to them.  After he got out of my room I locked the door.  It had not been locked before, because I was awake and was just relaxing.  So now I keep it lock, to keep the drunken Russian Bush Pilots out.  That's one of the stereotypes about Africa that I'm happy to leave in the realm of popular culture.
