Europeans that I’ve met during the election campaign, like their idealistically blinded progressive counterparts in the U.S. seem to think that Obama is going to cure everything that ills the nation.  As I said in my analysis of his foreign policy, that isn’t going to happen.  The inertia of what has already taken place over decades will constrain him; the centrifugal pull of bureaucratic organizational design will constrain him; and the fact that he isn’t a dictator and is still beholden to the other two branches of government will constrain him.  Obama will (hopefully) give a style, a flavor, and a presence to the US presidency that has been lacking since Reagan (or JFK, depending on which side of the aisle you sit).  That is what I am excited for.  However he will end up getting mocked and ridiculed by the Euro’s eventually.  He will get called a hawk and a war-monger.  He will likely be called many of the same things that GWB has been called.  My hope is that those calling names will be fewer, have less basis for their arguments and generally be classified as radical rather than mainstream.  

This last part sort of goes to the heart of the matter.  In many ways Europe needs us to be the war-mongering bad cop to their peacenik good cop.  It provides the security assurances as well as progress that have regulated most of the world (albeit badly in a very many instances) since the end of the Cold War.  And yet, no one on this side of the Atlantic is ever willing to admit that!  We grumble and saber rattle at the Iranians while they negotiate with the Iranians.  We scare people into their arms.  All the while, information is being passed back and forth under the table as there is no way you’ll be able to convince me that the intelligence services are not talking to each other on each of these issues.
