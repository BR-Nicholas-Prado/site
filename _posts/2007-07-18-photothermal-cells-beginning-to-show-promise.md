[![17thermal600][2]][2]  
[this][2] has promise.  i’ve heard about it before, but this article in the nytimes breaks it down nicely.  essentially, it uses the sun’s heat to formulate steam to turn generators to produce power rather than using photovoltaic cells which are inefficient and terribly expensive (although the prices are going down quickly and may go down further the more that they are made). photothermal cells produce heat by focussing the sun’s rays onto a specific metallic point.

one thing that has always concerned me about solar that currently  
concerns me is that there is a massive amount of heavy metals and heavy  
chemicals to process the heavy metals that are required to produce  
photovoltaic cells  i don’t know that much about the photothermal cells  
but they appear to be mirrors more than anything.  if that is the case  
then they may be a bit more enviro-friend to make rather than only  
enviro-friend to use.  

now i lived in the desert for four years, i’ve felt the power of the sun on metal (most times accidentally, because i’m a klutz) and i know how hot it can get things  the question i have had about this technology since i first heard about it on a podcast about a year ago is whether it would be powerful enough to turn generators enough to have a decent capacity per land use acre.  it seems that it is, as this farm the NYT’s reports on has a higher capacity than even the largest photovoltaic farms.  this capacity is seemingly low…64 megawatts…when compared to an average coal-fired or natural-gas-fired plant which average over 500 megawatts.  

however this concern can be mitigated if the business plan of huge, centralized power plants transmitting power over massive geographical scapes (with the attendant loss of electricity over each mile of power line transmission, which if i remember correctly from my undergraduate coursework is something like 2% or so per mile), to something more localized.  there is a lot of work being done on this that i’ve read and if i can scrounge will post links to, but many scholars are researching whether it would be more efficient to put lots of small energy generating devices around a region rather than centralizing.  it may be more costly for the energy companies as they would have to service more locations, but it may not be as the smaller devices may break down at a slower rate and be less expensive to maintain, also they may be more reliable as redundancies could be placed into the system in more locations with more flexibility.  also there may be environmental benefits by spreading out whatever pollution is created.  nevertheless i’d put a photothermal farm on my roof.

the most heartening statistic in the entire piece is that the photothermal cells are producing electricity at about 12 to 14 cents per kilowatt-hour where the national average is 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.  although that may be after subsidies (it wasn’t exactly clear), they are also subject to inefficiencies due to the nascent status of the technology.  so it seems likely that if the subsidies were tapered off the costs may remain the same or even decrease as it becomes cheaper to make the farms and as they understand the technology more and can tweak its efficiencies.
