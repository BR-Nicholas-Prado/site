[This][1] is one of the most informative and balanced pieces on Iraq I’ve read in AGES.  Not sure of its accuracy, but it certainly isn’t too glowing about either party.  I think this is the level of public debate that needs to really be entered into as I detest the black and white stay or leave debate which really gets no one anywhere.  Some of the musings of politicos lately have been whether the American people are able to hear complexity out of their politicians.  Most times I scream yes, but after a trip to Waffle House I think maybe not.
