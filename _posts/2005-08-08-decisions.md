everyone around me suddenly appears to be suspect.  like they have morphed from being just humans, to having some sort of alien aura about them.  like i put on a magic pair of sun glasses and can see that they are all out to get me.  but i’m not paranoid about it, merely concerned.  and so i just don’t talk to them.  i just stifle it all and let it settle into a ball of goo in the lower regions of my stomach.  let it cause ulcers or maybe hemmeroids.  and then what?  what the fuck happens after?  not sure.

this weekend i’ve been subjected to a fullcourt press of strange looks and non-caring sighs from my family.  as if my normal self-deprecating and and self-analyzing nature wasn’t enough.  now i’m subjected to this as well.  as if i wasn’t stressed out enough, now i get to add this.  can no one merely empathize with my position and trust me to make the right decision?  i guess not.  excerpts from a conversation with a hero:

> *so why aren’t you going to vanderbilt?  why don’t you want to go to law school?*

it isn’t that i don’t want to go to law school.  i just want to do other things.

> *you know what kind of a pedigree you would give up by not going?  you know how well respected that is?*

the "oooo" factor diminishes exponentially with your radius from dixie.  it isn’t exactly harvard, nor is it florida state university.  

> *you know what kind of doors it would open for you?*

yes.  but at what cost in time and debt do i go into this thing "merely for options."  i mean $150K in debt is a pretty fucking big gamble that i’m going to have some major employment opportunities waiting for me on the back side.  if i wanted to just keep writing i’d have to have some massive offers waiting on the table to afford a decent lifestyle plus that kind of a "mortgage."  if i don’t go and i keep writing, i only have the minimum of debt and will probably be able to live fine on that.

> *you know what kind of ass you would pull at a college campus?*

yes.  lots.  but is that why i’m going?

so here i am stressed out of my own mind and then all this stuff is added on top of it.  all my friends and family are asking me constantly what the hell i’m going to be doing in a week.  will it be law school will it be writing.  i know that they all intend well, i know that they were just concerned, but it is overfuckingwhelming on my end of the spectrum.  at least ten emails a day and at least four voicemails a day for the last week all asking the same question.  it would be fuck loads easier if i had an answer to give them.  either way, even if it was the answer that i don’t want to be giving them, right now i’d pick that shit over this ambiguous purgatory where i have to plan for all possibilities.

so here i am in this house of death, watching both of my grandparents deteriorate before my very eyes.  my aunt is departing in tears, thoroughly convinced that one or both will die before she would have a chance to return.  my mother has put the world on her shoulders as usual is playing the martyr to a T.  and here i am.  detached and calloused to death because of my experiences.  when i’ve seen it so vividly, even those close to me become just another person on the battlefield.  how the HELL is that possible.  this is my mamo.  my grandmother.  why do i feel zero emotional attachtment to what is going on.  i realize that it is a coping mechanism, that i’m so terrified of facing my own mortality on any scale (probably because i don’t feel that my morality house is exactly in order) that i don’t deal with death.  that i just isolate it and do not force myself to face it.  

but that is going to change real fast i have a notion.  we’ll just have to see how it all plays out.

this is the most depressed i’ve been in a long, long time.
