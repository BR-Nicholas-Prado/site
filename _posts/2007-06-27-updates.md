have added little stories and captions to the pictures which were priorly unannotated in the [Salone][1] photo album, the [Liberia][2] photo album and the [Upcountry][3] photo album.

so far holland is much less photogenic and i’ve taken few pictures.  but maybe soon, i’ll quit working long enough to take some, and our holiday to georgia/azerbiajan is fast approaching.  

also added [maps][4] of Salone/Liberia so that you can follow along with the adventures.
