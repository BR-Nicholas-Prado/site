[THiS is][1] a letter from the Prosecutor of the ICC.  

 [1]: http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf

Yesterday I wrote about the gaps in the climate change debate.  This document was written in February, 2006 and is the Prosecutor’s response to requests that he look into the Iraq situation.  He lays out his legal authority and his decision space in a very nice, non-lawyer-friendly manner.  And then he says, thank you but no.  

Now, there were no requests that he investigate US actors in Iraq, becuase the US and Iraq are not a state parties to the ICC.  In order for the ICC to prosecute something one of three things has to happen.  (1) The action was perpetrated by a national of one of the state parties. (2) The action was perpetrated on the territory of one of the state parties. (3) Either the territory where the action took place or the nationality of the actor must concede jurisdiction on a case by case basis.  None of those things happened with regards to the US actors in Iraq.

However, with regards to the Brits and Aussies who are, actually, world citizens and a part of the ICC, their nationals were subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC.  That means that the prosecutor had the power to investigate their soldiers.

Now all this is a prelude to my point.  I am intrigued by what he says.  He says that there was a basis for a reasonable belief that crimes were commited, but that the gravity of the crimes was low enough that he was not going to pursue an investigation.  Everyone gets so wrapped around the axel on Iraq, and rightly so, it is a quagmire.  However, it is telling when he says that the number of victims of crimes in Iraq totals in the dozens (less than forty total).  In the three cases where he has actually pursued full investigations (two of which led to indictments and one has a case starting soon) the number of victims totals in the thousands or millions.  This disparity is so huge and is completely missed by the media.  We spend so much of our media attention on Iraq and other things (NaSA love triangles I hear is currently popular for infotainment) and so very little on the real humanity of the situation. 

That is about all I have to say about that.
