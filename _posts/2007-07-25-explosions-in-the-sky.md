[![I41853p0pkv][2]][2][explosions in the sky][2] is my favorite band.  luckily it looks like they are back on tour, opening for smashing pumpkins, which i think would be a good fit, although i haven’t heard the new SP album.  they are coming to nashville in november.  i’ll be there.  buy their new album – [all of a sudden i miss everyone][3].  if you have any doubts as to the beauty and brilliance, peruse its [metacritic page][4].
