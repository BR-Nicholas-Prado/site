so i think that i was born like 5 years too early.  this is different than my usual time shifting desires where i think that i was born either fifty or twenty years too late.  but any way back to my rant of the day.  i think that i was born like 5 years too early.  

the main reason that leads me to say this is my utter inability to cross platform communicate.  i have reached this level that many my age haven’t.  i mean, hell, i do blog.  that comes from always being a tech-head, an occupational hazard from being born to a dude who was poking around with magnetic screwdrivers inside of IBM PC’s, XT’s and the sleek yet subdued AT’s at that strip mall computer joint circa 84 when the auto parts store fired him, or he left.  not sure i was small.

yeah, so cross platform communication.  i have think i am an utter master at the independent forms of communication.  i can text while holding an apple in my mouth, changing my ipod music and driving with my knee over snowy vail pass.  i can blog.  i can talk on my cell phone.  i can talk to people.  i can email.  i can post messages on the wall’s of my friend’s facebook.com pages. i can see who was looking at my pages on friendster or my space.  i can virtual stalk my friends and laugh at their IM away messages and can even induce a few chuckles myself.  i can IM harrassing messages to my "colleagues" when they are called on in class and for some reason the IT people haven’t blocked the internet that particular class (of course this only happens when i remember to bring my wireless PCMCIA card, b/c i’m not advanced tech-boy and do not have this snazzy internal wireless thing….no wires….fucking genius.)

what i cannot really well is to transfer across these platforms.  for some reason i feel like communications which happened in one forum should stay in that forum only.  i have always known this, but it was driven home to me today when someone came up to me and said, "i just added you as a friend on facebook."  

"i know."  i said with my crunched eyebrows face.  i’m not sure if i was confused as to whether he genuinely thought he was informing me.  was i confused b/c i’m not really his friend and we never talk and suddenly his clicking on my profile and the "add friend" button is the lubrication to get the ole’ engine of friendship and get to know ya started up again.  was i confused b/c i just don’t like to communicate out of context.  i’m not sure why i gave him that look, but i certainly did.

oh well, it started a nice little chat with my new friend.  i know he is my friend to because i have a fucking web page with my name in bold and big font and he is listed under my friends.  maybe it is all growing on me.  maybe i just like to know who my friends are.  where do i title my BFF?
