[![740759036_l_1][2]][2] tonight i saw this movie.  you should too.  it contains a decent soundtrack and one of my favorite vehicles for a narrative framework: the roadtrip.  some of the scenes in it were so spot on i didn’t know what to do.  i lapsed in to an analysis of the femine/masculine perspectives on life but was torn out of it when i realized that all the women around me were laughing at the things happening just as often as i was.

there was one scene where they had just finished a long day’s drive and the boy is tired.  they climb into bed and all he wants to do is sleep, she is glowing from him even asking her to accompany him on the trip and in general and presumably had been sleeping the entire time .  she turns to him after he has expired the light and asks him if he loves her, "yes, baby, of course." he  manages to mumble.  "what is it about me that you love?" she asks.  he is so taken aback that she wants to have a serious conversation that he immediately is put on the defensive and is ostensibly thinking "what the fuck did i do wrong now?" she is presumably bolstered by the intimacy (whether faux or real, whether imposed by the societal implications of many family journeys or not) that a road trip inevitably entails and wants to bask in that glow with conversation, the feminine fuel.  but his tanks are dry and all he wants to do is to get some fucking sleep.  

i flashed back to every relationship i’ve ever had.  it was a magnificent scene.  i thought that the beginning was fucking brilliant, the middle was honestly great, and the ending was OK.  

and that is my first movie review….deal with it.
