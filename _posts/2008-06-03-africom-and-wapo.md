I have been fascinated to watch how AFRICOM develops.  [Washington Post][1] has a very interesting article the other day about how AFRICOM has been received on the continent.  The gist of the article contains two interrelated theorems: (1) that Bush's rhetorical fascination with terrorism has pigeon-holed his foreign policy measures that have little to do with terrorism; (2) that African leaders and American policy makers are like Somali Pirates and French Sailors passing each other quietly in the night with little understanding of the other.

I think the quote that sums up the article is:  
> Under Africom, one command will consolidate military responsibility for  
> all of Africa, excluding Egypt. Although it encompasses the volatile  
> Horn of Africa and the U.S. Navy's forward operating base in Djibouti  
> and will take over training tasks on the continent, it has no other  
> dedicated troop components. "There are very few scenarios which would  
> create a U.S. military intervention" in Africa, said one Africom  
> officer who was not authorized to speak on the record. "Arguably, there  
> are no scenarios." 
> With its headquarters on the continent, liaison groups of 20 to 30  
> military personnel established in key countries and U.S. units brought  
> in to help with development and relief tasks, the command was  
> envisioned as an example to Africans of how their own armed forces and  
> civilians could work together for the good of their nations. 

> The trouble was, no one consulted the Africans. "Very little was  
> really known by the majority of people or countries in Africa who were  
> supposed to know before such a move was made," said retired Kenyan army  
> Lt. Gen. Daniel Opande. Worry swept the continent that the United  
> States planned major new military installations in Africa. 

> "If you know the politics of Africa," said Opande, who has headed  
> U.N. peacekeeping forces in Sierra Leone and Liberia, "you know there  
> are certain very powerful countries who said, no, we are not interested  
> in having a headquarters here." South Africa and Nigeria were among  
> them, and their resistance helped persuade others. 

> Over the past seven years, the administration has more than tripled  
> U.S. assistance to Africa, to about $9 billion annually, nearly half of  
> which is spent on prevention and treatment for HIV-AIDS. U.S. military  
> training for African forces has steadily expanded, and U.S. troops have  
> undertaken humanitarian missions in several countries — digging wells,  
> building schools and providing medical care. Africom's budget request  
> for 2009 is about $400 million. 

> But despite the promise of new development and security  
> partnerships, many Africans concluded that Africom was primarily an  
> extension of U.S. counterterrorism policy, intended to keep an eye on  
> Africa's large Muslim population. 

> "I think everyone thought it would be widely greeted as something  
> positive," the Africom officer said. "But you suddenly have wide  
> publics that have no idea what we're talking about. . . . It was seen  
> as a massive infusion of military might onto a continent that was quite  
> proud of having removed foreign powers from its soil." 

> The United States "equates terrorism with Islam," senior Kenyan  
> diplomat Bethuel Kiplagat said, and few African governments wanted to  
> be seen as inviting U.S. surveillance on their own people. 

> Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations  
> African affairs subcommittee, thought Africom was "something that would  
> show real respect for Africa." But there was no question, Feingold  
> said, that the concept had "a neocolonialist feel to it."
