[No Longer in Race, Richardson Is a Man Pursued][2].  It isn’t a secret that before he dropped out, I was hoping that Bill Richardson would make a good showing.  Now that he is out of the race (no pun intended), I have been wondering whether he would be attractive to the candidates, and if he was in what regard.

Seems that both candidates are courting him.  Not sure to what extent they are lobbying for his endorsement, for his superdelegate vote, or for him to be a running mate or cabinet level position (Sec State most likely).  

I, and to a certain extent, Big_Head have been lusting after an Obama – Richardson Ticket for about a year now (or, alternatively a Richardson – Obama ticket).  This would make much sense for Obama.  In my mind it would make more sense than the Obama – Clinton "dream ticket" that many pundits speak of.  In the Obama – Clinton situation, you get all of the policies that are essentially the same.  You get experiences that are not that different.  And, most importantly, you get no additional bonuses (Clinton supporters are HIGHLY unlikely to not support Barack) with a bunch of turnoffs (all the moderates who have been known for a time to be anti-Hillary.  

An Obama – Richardson ticket would seem to me to present the opposite.  No one seems to be anti-Bill in the way that many moderates and conservatives.  There seems to be a contingent of conservatives that are likely to migrate to Barack if they are suitably anti-McCain…which, BTW, I don’t really understand but have heard many tell me personally that they would migrate Barack’s way now that John is the Republican nominee.  Further, Richardson can ADD to Obama’s base if he was on the ticket in the way that Clinton would not really be able to add.  

Clinton holds a very partisan Democratic base who I do not see migrating away if Barack is the candidate.  Clinton’s base has never been noted to be moderates.  Barack has been winning those since Iowa, and has continued to.  Richardson brings experiences that will bolster the ticket (especially in the foreign policy realm where I would admit Barack appears to me to be a bit weaker than McCain).  Richardson also will be able to identify with Hispanic moderates and help Barack win that HUGE vote in the general.  Hillary has done OK with the Latin vote to date, but I do not see it being the same without the identity politics that would come into play if Richardson was the running mate.  

So, we’ll have to see how it plays out.  All of this is (obviously) predicated on Barack pulling it out March 4 and afterwards.  I think that is increasingly going to be realized.  But, again, we never know!
