left nashville this weekend to walk in the woods.  it helped.  spent saturday night buried in my books at a hipster coffee shop smoking rolled cigarettes.

tonight i watched a rockumentary called the last waltz.  it made me crave my former life more than i normally do.  shit.  whatever, tomorrow i return to the land of dockers.

the best part of the weekend, however, was when a friend of mine turned to me at happy hour and laid the best compliment i’ve received in years on me.  "you know man from now on i’m going to call you: THE DUDE."  "pour me another caucasian gary."
