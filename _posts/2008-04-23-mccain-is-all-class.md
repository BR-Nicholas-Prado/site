I’m not a McCain supporter.  However, I am very very pleased that he was able to secure the Republican nomination.  The backstory is linked to above, but the letter below is prima facie evidence of McCain’s class as a human.  It is shit like this that I highly respect.  Very Well Done Mr. Senator.

> confronting America today. I expect all state parties to do so as well.  
> The television advertisement you are planning to air degrades our  
> civics and distracts us from the very real differences we have with the  
> Democrats. In the strongest terms, I implore you to not run this  
> advertisement.

> This ad does not live up to the very high standards we should hold

> sharp contrasts with the Democrats on fundamental issues critical to  
> the future course of our country. But we need not engage in political  
> tactics that only seek to divide the American people.

> Once again, it is imperative that you withdraw this offensive advertisement.

> John McCain
