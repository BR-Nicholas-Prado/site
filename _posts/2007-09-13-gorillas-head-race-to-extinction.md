More good environmental news from BBC.  The worst part is that the gorillas are getting killed in the great lakes area for their meat and for other things.

Heading to Austin this weekend for [ACL][3].  Quite stoked to see Bloc Party and Indigo Girls.  Don’t fuck with me I’m serious.  I once had a professor in undergrad who moved the final because Dave Matthews was playing, and when he announced this he said that if the Indigo Girls were playing he would have canceled the finals because he loved them so much that he would want to ensure that we went to see them.  Now that’s fan devotion.  Of course Dylan will be there.  I think he will be a gamble, either really good or really bad.  White Stripes and Byork should also be good.  Will hopefully listen to some COW Bell action with LCD Soundsystem, although I hope they play at night as they would not be good to see during the day.  Other highlights: Arcade Fire, Gotan Project, Clap Your Hands, Ghostland Observatory and it goes on and on.
