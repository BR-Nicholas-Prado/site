I know that it is trendy in the UK to bash on Gordon Brown.  I agree with his critics, mostly.  However this Guardian article points out what things he does seem to get entirely correct.  

There are two particular things that I like about his stance:  (1) his willingness to open up the power structure to a few more voices in recognition of their growing importance; (2) his (apparent) understanding of the intricacies of post-conflict transitions.  

On the first point.  It seems to me that the time is coming where it is unavoidable that the "winners" in WWII are going to have to cede some of their relative monopoly on power.  This will create a shift in international politics as the center of gravity shifts from somewhere around the mid-Atlantic to somewhere else.  Brown is lobby for India, Brazil, Germany, Japan and an African State to be named later to get permanent seats on the Security Council.  Realists in America and Russia have resisted this and it is likely that they will continue to resist, at least through the end of the Bush administration which seems to understand little about the world outside of their mansions.  But it will be interesting to see if we can get an administration into the White House with a different notion of international politics how it will play out.  An arrangement such as this will complicate negotiations when action needs to be streamlined and quick, but I think that the SC is fairly impotent as it is and the addition of a few voices and the recognition that moving forward we need to integrate these voices (on top of the addition of Germany and Japan will put to bed much of the WWII winners/losers stuff) into the discussion outweighs additional difficulties in negotiations.

On the second point.  I have been thinking for a while about a task force to go in under a UN mandate that is more than only delegations from DPKO to help in post-conflict transitions.  I have been wondering, essentially, why this hasn’t happened, because to my ignorant eyes it seems like a fantastic po-mo solution.  Brown’s idea is this:

> Today, on the final day of his tour of India and China, Brown will  
> announce plans for a UN crisis prevention and recovery fund, worth  
> $200m (£102m), which would put judges, police and fire service staff on  
> standby to support countries immediately as they come out of conflict.

And I think that it is very forward thinking.  Sovereignists will likely argue that it is and internationalization of the rule of law and essential services that will take away too much authority from the state and propagate brain-drain and a welfare culture among developing countries.  Done wrongly, they are right.  However, done correctly they could be wrong.  We are seeing in Kenya now that much of the violence (although tribal based) is based upon land redistribution issues.  Sending in a small team of judges to rule ON KENYAN law, but untainted by tribal allegiances may be able to make a huge positive contribution to resolution of the core problems which are causing the violence.  The teams must be careful  when establishing their mandates as I see a big difference in sending judges in to rule on land redistribution issues and meddling in something completely politicized (like the legitimacy of the election results).  Something of this magnitude will have other effects such as politicizing decisions of when do they  go into a country, what do they do, etc.  But the hopes of cross-cultural experience and cultivation of institutions may outweigh the downsides in my mind.
