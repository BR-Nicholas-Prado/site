"chasing amy" is on tonite.  i’m watching my past.  i’m amused by the scene where they throw darts.  i also like jason lee’s character, it’s one of the internally truest characters in movie-dom.

why do people always lie when answering the question:  how are you?

news of the day:  jimmy swaggart told some people that if a guy ever looked at him weird he’d kill them.  reminds me of when i was drunk in LA soon after the war and i told these chick’s i’d "fucking kill them."  i don’t even, to this day, have a clue what set me off.  

my current consumption rate is equalling out at about a bottle and a third of wine a night.  that’s a lot of grapes.  but, nevertheless, we’re getting some good work done.

no final answer on the USMC job yet.  homeboy that is in charge of setting things up for me is pissing me off becuase I called his ass on tuesday and still haven’t heard back from him, that’s two days worth of return phone call time.  maybe he’s on leave….

heard back a tiny bit on SHOOTER today, from the assistant editor and he liked it a lot.  we’ll see though in another week or so when the actual editor gives it a read.  just want to get it done so we can move on to other projects mentally.

guess that’s it!
