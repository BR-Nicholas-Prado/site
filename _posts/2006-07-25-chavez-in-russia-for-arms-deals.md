Chavez signs a deal with Russia.  This is HUGE.  I cannot believe that the US press is not picking up on this.  Understandably there is a lot going on in the world and if you are passionately positioned on either side of the Israel-Arab tension then you would prefer to be hearing of other things and if you are positioned in the heat that is engulfing the entire west coast then you may also have other things on your mind.  

However, this has massive, long term implications for US Policy in our hemisphere.  In my mind it is more impactful than the Cuban missile crisis for this reason:  Cuba was an isolate proxy with limited economic power.  Venezuela has a relatively stable government, Chavez is fairly entrenched for the foreseeable future, their oil reserves enable the country to pursue a long-term, viable economy.  Cuba had none of these, they relied completely on the Soviets for whatever materiel and training support needed.  Ven on the other hand will not have to rely on anyone for the materiel support or the economic support.  They will have to get the education and training in order to really utilize any advanced weapon systems, but for state actors that is easy enough to achieve.

The real problem is that to date the US has successfully kept any of the countries in our hemisphere from becoming a real military powerhouse unless their governments are imperialistic proxies and beholden to us.  Ven is a wildcard and Chavez’s recent efforts to expand his power and influence in the region will only be amplified if he can get his hands on some symbols of nationalistic power and entrance into a more elite group.  

There is too much here and I wish that I would be seeing more on it, this has large not in my backyard implications as well as (and I may be being a bit fatalistic) it may signal the beginning of the end of the monroe doctrine (which would crumble not from external pressure from the rest of the world, but from internal pressure from the "protectorate").
