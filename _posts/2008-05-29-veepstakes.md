One of my favorite pundit-ers is [Marc Ambinder][1] who writes for the Atlantic.

He has a great [article][2] on how candidates go about selecting running mates.

I'm not sure how it will play out for Obama, much less for McCain.  I certainly hope that the robot-republican doesn't win.  For Obama, I'm going to slow play my predictions, but I will say that I was a Richardson supporter before I was an Obama supporter.
