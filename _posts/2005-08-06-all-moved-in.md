OK kids.  The pizza is half-eaten, cold, and greasing up the coffeetable for me.  There are beer bottles in a pile somewhere near THAT corner of the room, in the vicinity of the empty boxes that are broken down into flat cardboard for storage in the garage somewhere.  

In other words.  I’m all moved in.  It took me much of the day to move all that stuff over from xanga but we’re here now.  While I was scouring the bathroom I was thinking that there had to be an automated script that could move my shit for me and my doesn’t comet smell good.  But there wasn’t, and in fact it is a pain to wash off the sinks.  

Well it feels good to be here kids.  Lost the comments on my ole’ blog entries and my xanga subscriber (all one of her, poor, lonely shlub schlecking along some tundra screaming, "wi-fi, wi-fi, i need some wifi") will feel abandoned now that she will have to bookmark my site.  But this is the wave of the future daddy-o, you just gotta ride it.
