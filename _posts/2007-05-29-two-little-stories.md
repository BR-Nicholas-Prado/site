excerpt: "Have been saving two little stories.  Not sure why I have been saving them, but I have.  My time is starting to wind down here now and I feel compelled to clean some things up.  Not yet sure when I’m going to leave Salone, but it is going to be soon.  I think that the absolute latest I will be here will be the 20th, which is only three weeks and two weekends from now.  The soonest I’ll be able to leave will be mid-week next week.  For a lot reasons I’m over this place.  People are leaving at the speed of naught, the rains are coming and we have no Tv, new people are replacing the old and I cannot be bothered to get to know them when I’m such a short timer, and at any event no matter where you are it is difficult when you are a short timer.  I just want to do the few remaining things and get the muck out of here."

Have been saving two little stories.  Not sure why I have been saving them, but I have.  My time is starting to wind down here now and I feel compelled to clean some things up.  Not yet sure when I’m going to leave Salone, but it is going to be soon.  I think that the absolute latest I will be here will be the 20th, which is only three weeks and two weekends from now.  The soonest I’ll be able to leave will be mid-week next week.  For a lot reasons I’m over this place.  People are leaving at the speed of naught, the rains are coming and we have no Tv, new people are replacing the old and I cannot be bothered to get to know them when I’m such a short timer, and at any event no matter where you are it is difficult when you are a short timer.  I just want to do the few remaining things and get the muck out of here.

The first story is about a light.  A small little light, not hidden under a bush oh no.  I used to tell the first part of the story at dinner parties as I thought it was a nice picture of lost in translation, but then I realized that it wasn’t lost in translation and felt really bad.

When we first moved here the lights in the kitchen didn’t work.  In order to cook we had to leave the door to the refrigerator open to light the kitchen.  There were a lot of problems with this, not the least of which is that the refrigerator is only on during the night anyway and whatever is in there tends to partially cook during the day and so will only stay good for a very short time.  In addition the little of cool air that the food gets in the evening is compromised by having the door open.  Another in furiating thing is that the light coming out of the fridge was not very bright and it was still quite dreary.

After a few nights I put my foot down.  Generally I like to think that with a little extra effort you can achieve a decent standard of living, and so along those lines I told our "landlord" that we just needed a light in the kitchen.  It was of no moment to me that she has a cook who she treats like shit and we cook for ourselves, I wasn’t bothered by the fact that she was never in there.  We were and she needed to provide a lamp for us. 

So she conceded to buy a lamp and she told Ibrahim to go out the next day and buy a lamp.  Backflash a few days.  The light in Brett’s room wasn’t working and he had asked Ibrahim to buy a small reading light for him.  So Ibrahim had recently bought this little reading light for Brett, one of those small things that you clip onto the books.  But Brett’s also had a stand and you could plug it in.  

When the landlord asked Ibrahim to buy a lamp for the kitchen he bought another of these little reading things.  It didn’t light the kitchen as well as the small light in the fridge, but at least we didn’t have to leave the door open to the fridge and let our food further spoil!!!!  I used to tell this story as a funny bit to illustrate how easily things could get lost in translation. 

Then a bit later I walked out of my compound and was heading down the hill to congo cross (the big intersection) to catch a cab and go somewhere…posh, i’m sure, and as I passed one of the little shack-villes i saw that there were seven people sitting around one of these little lights. it clicked for me then that it wasn’t lost in translation, this was what they knew.  Ibrahim didn’t know any better, I think.  To him that was a lamp to light a room.  

It broke my heart for a lot of reasons.  

The second story ends with the following phrase: so at least now I’ve had my alone, car broke down, no money and no phone in a third world country miles from no where story.  You’ll have to ask me that one over a beer!
