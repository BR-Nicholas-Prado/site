sorry. not dead, just lost.  no days off, but at least the work is interesting.  we file april 4th, so i will have a life again after that. looking forward to my trip to senegal and the gambia the 6th through the 15th.  right now there is a heated euro politico debate in my office between a right wing german-swiss and a left wing french-swiss. it’s awesome! 

check this out. it is kind of a postscript to the movie: [Diamonds Move From Blood to Sweat and Tears][1].
