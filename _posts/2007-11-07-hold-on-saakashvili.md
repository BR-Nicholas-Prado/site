Georgia was [AMAZING][2].  Highlands and I went there this past summer and I really fell in love with the people, with the environment, with the food, with the wine, with most everything there.  It is disappointing that there are many [allegations][3] of extensive human rights violations by the country and that there is the (real or not) perception of rampant corruption in the country.  These allegations have led to [massive protests ][4]in beautiful old Tbilisi.  There are huge possibilities for good in this country and I hope that the President, Saakashvili is smart enough to be able to quell this thing without having to resort to Soviet era tactics of repression.  I will be an unequivocal supporter of him if he can figure out a way to address the core of what the protestors are saying (his administration is a bastion of cronyism and the opposition’s voice is being suppressed using state resources).
