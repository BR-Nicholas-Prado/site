i leave for senegal in just a bit on Sloc, some airline that has a less stellar safety record…apparently.  although from what I’ve heard they aren’t as bad as others in west africa, so maybe i’ll be ok.  plus they play backstreet boys loud and on the speakers so everyone is able to enjoy the festivities.  

senegal, from what i can tell, is a mecca for tourists who desire adventure, good music, good food, maybe a pick-pocketing here and there, cafes, bookstores and the beach.  i crave all of the above.  but mostly i’m looking forward to being able to run up my credit cards even higher!  here i am limited by a completely cash based economy.  there, i’ll be able to ruin my credit rating further!  sa-WEET.  

more on the craziness of that country when i arrive!  also will likely touch mauritania and The Gambia whilst there.  OUTTY!
