The DA in Miami has added more counts of torture to Chuckie’s indictment.  His trial is set to begin in Miami in January 2008.  I find it cute that father and son will begin their trials at about the same time.

Chuckie is Charles Taylor’s son, he was the former President (dictator) of Liberia who was one of the most infamous warlords ever.  The African President from [Lord of War][2] was based (loosely) on Charles Taylor.  Chuckie was born in Boston but raised in Orlando area, and is roughly my age.  I wonder if I ever ran into him at the [Altamonte Mall movie theater][3].

I wonder if the US should give them a group discount.
