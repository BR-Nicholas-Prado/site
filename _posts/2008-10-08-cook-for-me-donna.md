I will bypass comment regarding last night’s debate.  It is almost painful to watch the death of the Robertson/Nixon Conservative coalition happen before our eyes.  If it hadn’t have turned so ugly at the end (like new deal liberalism died a violent death with LBJ), it would have been actually painful.  

Instead, I offer for your consumption a slightly different perspective.
