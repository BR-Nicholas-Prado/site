# 

the pope passing on is significant.  i wonder how much of that significance will be lost on the seventh-day adventist church because of its complete anti-catholicism stance.  or will it perhaps spawn a thought process, one of reevaluation of that stance.  

if we are not constantly, vehemently justifying our existence would people still subscribe to the dogma?  i think that is the crux of the matter for some of the more learned leaders of my (former?) church. 

we have two pastors in our class:  bron and louis.

all is protected from here on out.
