i like the SNL skit where they make fun of that sunday morning news show.  and they use ‘next issue’ to punctuate debates.  i’ll think of the name of it in a minute.  

i finish with the court tomorrow, although i’ll be in holland for another week and probably in and out of the office to tidy up a few things.  the rest of the summer will be spent all over.  a map is embedded for you to follow along.  the highlights.  fly to Tbilisi, Georgia, then go to the Georgian Mountains to dodge sketchy Chechnyan Separatists and their land mines.  Then down to the Georgian Wine Country to get drunk.  Then to Azerbaijan mainly because I like its name.  Then back to Schipel to drop Highlands off and pick up my dad.  Then to Prague, Berlin, Cologne and then back to Amsterdam.  Then I have two nights and a day with Highlands and then I fly from AMS to Miami via London.  So it will be crazy.  Pictures and Updated Where is Casey as we go along.
