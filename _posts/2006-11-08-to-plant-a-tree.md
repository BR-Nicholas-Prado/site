the african environmental advocate who is the only african female nobel laureate is now starting a program to plant a billion trees world wide.  advantages: soil stability, carbon sequestration, jobs, beauty.

disadvantages?  can’t really think of anything, other than where is the $ going to come from.  

see, this is the type of solution that [adam][1] would advocate for.  rather than spending gagillians of dollars on technological solutions that will only benefit a few smart, well-to-do people.  the distribution of the benefits of this solution are correct: it benefits financially those that need it, it benefits environmentally on a regional (soil stability) and global level (carbon sequestration).

my uncle planted trees for a while.  he seems to look on that time in his life fondly.  hard work, but out in nature.  maybe if i don’t get a lawyer job i can just do this.
