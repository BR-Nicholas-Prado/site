if you haven’t seen [this][1] article, you should.  it is flippin’ crazy. i want to print out a nice tulia style burrito from amigos with chips, salsa and some water with that ICE….!!! wonder if this will enable humans to be even more lazy in their shopping and when they shop….could make xmas even an exciting time.
