> Everyone Funding Startups!!! [Grow VC][1]  
> is the first global crowdfunding tool for web and mobile startups.

 [1]: http://www.growvc.com/main/index.html

This is a fantastic idea, which compliments so nicely with Kiva.  My only critique is that it is very tech focused.  Although it makes a  
logical entry point for oversight reasons (primarily), I hope that they  
will open it up to other sectors.  Everyday I meet business people  
here in Africa with fantastic ideas.  The capital flight from Africa has  
created a situation where they cannot get access to mid-level funding.   
Grow VC fills a very important gap in the finance world and I wish  
them nothing but success.

On the notion of capital flight, this is a major problem.  I heard a  
story recently about a high-level East African politician who had  
acquired a large sum of money but was having trouble getting the French  
banks to accept it.  Number one comment: good for the French banks.  But  
number two: if the African elites continue to put their money in developed  
world banks, their SMEs are going to continue to lack access to  
capital.  If they could decide to bring some of that money back and then  
the banks in their own countries could leverage that money via lending  
to SMEs Africa would develop a lot faster.

Honestly, development has a place but all the weeping for the world  
is tiring.  Let us stop whining and act.  Grow VC has done just that.
