so my grades came back today.  they were marginally better than last semester, but again the increase was marginal.  this is disappointing for two reasons.  

first, i worked really fucking hard last semester at developing and refining my written communications, apparently i didn’t work smarter since my legal writing grade dropped.  but i really thought that i was getting the hang of it, apparently everyone else was too.  i also worked really hard on the substantive law (the rules as applied to the class, basically the classwork) this semester, and especially towards finals.  i knew that stuff backwards and forwards, as well as anyone in my study group.  going into the conlaw final one of my groupmates told Yale that I had a strong chance of booking it.  i got a B.  so i know that i knew the substance of the class and i know that i worked really hard on the precision of my wording and the succinctity of my arguments.  alas, it only sort of paid off.

second, all my desires are to do things that really do require better grades than i’m getting.  wanna work in a city that does NOT hire vanderbilt grads?  yes!  Portland.  better be near the top.  shit.  wanna work in a big NY, posh law firm?  sort of.  better be near the top.  shit.  wanna be a legal academic?  yes.  better be near the top.  shit.  

so i was burnt about it.  i rationalized all of the why’s, mainly focusing on my lack of undergraduate preparation.  i mean shit, i’m not trying to discount Yale for getting a near 4.0, but i knew that stuff just as well as she did and here i’m sitting with a 3.2 and she’s looking at something much higher.  yes, grades aren’t that important casey, don’t let them define you.  i’m not letting them define me but employers will.  

but then i really got to thinking (it is now almost 3 and i’m not looking at sleeping much tonight).  when i have existential crises like these there are two questions that i ask myself:  (1) if i won the lottery what would i be doing, (2) why did i originally decide to do what i’m now doing.  those have served me well for a long time in starting the internal conversation about where i am, where i’ve been, where i could go and why i should choose case number 17.  

if i won the lottery i would finish law school and then i would form a boutique law firm with really smart, sophisticated, well-travelled people to work with developing nations to establish growth plans that pulled them out of poverty while retaining sustainability of their people, economic resources and natural resources.  

originally i decided to come to law school because of a feeling of powerlessness to accomplish what i wanted to accomplish.  it all came together for me during two events:  (1) on the phone with my mother when she was telling me that for the third hurricane in a month she was going to be stuck working at the hospital for an undisclosed amount of time, (2) watching live 8 on tv in my basalt apartment.  i was thinking that pulling developing countries out of poverty is all well and good, but you know, teach a man to fish.  if we forgive their debt and link it to benchmarks which the country achieves or fails to achieve would kick in or fail to kick in more incentives, then we can actually affect true change in the world.  if we just forgive their debt it would be like handing ten million dollars to the last three guests on jerry springer.  

there are a lot of other links in there.  i’m not going to actually connect the dots for you.  but the gist is that i entered law school because saint martin’s didn’t buy living with death and also that i was ready to go to work and i was ready to change some shit.

so if the money is taken out of the equation, then really everything would still line up and i would still be in the right place to achieve what i’m looking to achieve and i also have made the correct decision to be here.  

yet, it is really hard to remember this when you have firms firms firms firms shoved down your throat constantly.  firm life may be fine for some: those that like to engage in settling.  but when was the last time any one of you remembered me settling.  sure it happens, but i fucking hate it when i’m forced into it.  the simple fact is that i do not have to settle for some firm in portland or even making a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in NY.  i mean, shit, do i even want to really litigate any of these environmental claims.  they are all piddly, and if i’m in the firm it will be a massive compromise of my value system to have to convince juries that my clients’ aren’t really THAT bad.  fuck that.  i mean don’t hold me to this statement, but FUCK THAT.  

if i don’t have to do it than why am i even thinking it.  i know why:  b/c the system is designed that way.  college, don’t know what you want to do but can write, why not law school, law school, don’t know what you want to do but performed fine on their exams, why not a firm in X city, X city, marriage, kids, house, mortgage, car payments.  fuck that.  

plus i’m really over the US in general.  i mean if i’m only interested in living in two cities in this fucking country but can list at least 40 that i would love to live in outside of this country why am i even thinking about staying other than stagnation.  stagnation isn’t a good enough reason for me, although i have no reason to decry it nor to laud it for others. 

further, doing this would utilize what i’m good at:  advocacy, problem  
solving, talking and communicating (instead of telling someone this is  
how it has to be because the law says it is so), amorphous situations,  
creating simplicity out of complexity.  much law school has been about  
creating complexity out of simplicity.  this is another of my  
justifications, but i don’t really create complexity out of simplicity  
easily, i usually just think what is the point?  when you reverse it  
and create simplicity out of complexity and simplify things and package  
it for a specific audience, this is a skill i have in droves and few  
other lawyers possess it.  needless, i just need to be in an  
international forum. 

so all off the above reasoning has led me to this:  go abroad, refocus your efforts.  i have done some research tonight and in the past which has only served to show that it is a bright big world out there and i need to participate in it.  university of syndey has a one year LLM (masters of law, semi-PhD equivalent) and Masters of Environmental Science program that you can take in Germany.  England has numerous LLM’s in environmental law.  i could even take classes in Johannesburg i found out.  and afterwards?  well, we’ll figure it out.  perhaps i can find a group of persons who are interested in the same thing at one of these programs and we can figure it all out together.  perhaps there are boutiques out there that i just have to find that could hire me.  who knows.  

but the bottom line is that i cannot think that this semester’s grades are the end of the story.  as i told myself earlier, don’t put the final nail in my life’s coffin (nice metaphor, huh?) yet.  if i’m going to get out from entirely mediocre grades it will be by doing something dramatic, something big, something beyond the scale that these fuckers in their dockers and their dartmouth diplomas have never dreamed.

dream big.  i’ve always done it, i’ve always achieved it.  why stop now?
