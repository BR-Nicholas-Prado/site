ok.  so most of you know that i’m a rider.  i think that this is kind of odd, yet typical of my history.  i feel like i’m always half an oscillation off from popular culture.  this is what i mean, and really you can apply it to most areas of my hipster life be that fashion, word choices, music, hairstyles or the like.

see i started riding, really riding my snowboard when i got out of the marine corps, when i was 27.  that is old for a rider.  yes, people my age were pretty much the vangaurd of snowboarders, at least on the popular (as opposed to psycho subculture of a few weirdos) level.  yes, i did snowboard when i was in high school and college, albeit awefully (ask joe).  but i really got into the sport when i was already too old to fit in.  when i was in mammoth i was surrounded by riders, there everyone rode.  there everyone was 18 and smoked pot instead of coffee and instead of a nightcap.  so i was the old man.  but it was kool, no one really looked at me too sideways, except for the fact that i was wearing "mountaineering" clothes probably more suited to a skier than a rider.  but that didn’t seem to phase people.

the next winter i came here (where i am now).  i came to aspen.  it was a good transition, it was what i needed.  as i’ve written at length and told most people i know, this is my heaven, my paradise.  but here people my age do not ride.  they ski.  in fact the only people that ride here are the 15 to 20 crowd.  even the snowboard instructors are all younger than me, and the ones that are my age all tell me that on their days off they prefer to ski.

but me, obstinate as always, continued last season to ride.  i don’t really regret it.  i did improve to the point where nothing really scares me and i can pretty much get through anything on an area mountain.  backcountry stuff maybe maybe not.  but for the most part i can hold my own. today, however, i was thinking about all of this.  why don’t i ski?  there really is no reason that i can think of.

it is so much more elegant.  and not that i’m elegant in the slightest, i am the founding member of the alley cat climbing club, but i just seems more me to me.  you don’t have to fuck with strapping yourself in.  you don’t have to bother when you get to bump sections to change your style.  you can get away with wearing what i wear without being an oddity.  nonetheless i have kept riding.

sometimes i wonder if my window has passed.  now i’m a vacationer, i am one of those who i looked down upon while i lived in paradise.  i do not have an entire 100 days of skiing to perfect a new sport, so i am forced to make choices, to compromise.  so tomorrow i ski for the second day.  we’ll see how it goes.  i do like to ride, but i think that i’m bored with it a bit and looking for something new.  riding is fun on powder days, but other than that i think i have it.  

onward as always.
