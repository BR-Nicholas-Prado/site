i’m not naive enough to think that the causal links for this video can be traced all the way up the leadership chain to bush.  whatever happened is probably too complex to comment upon.  but what i can comment upon is that i hope to god this is some sick fucking joke, and if it is not  then this simple-minded moron should be taken out of the gene pool.  i know this much, none of my marines treated any iraqi’s like this and if i would have caught them they would have been taken out of the gene pool.  

the worst thing, I think is how proud this son of a bitch thinks that he is about what he did.  hopefully it is a joke.
