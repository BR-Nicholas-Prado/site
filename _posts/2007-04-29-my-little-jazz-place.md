excerpt: "so for much of my life i have had this fantasy that i would eventually find a jazz club that would replace in my mind the absence of me not being alive in the late 50′s and early 60′s and being black and living in NYC and therefore unable to stoll down 52d street and hear coltrane and others jamming in real-time and only for themselves.  although i’ve been all over the states, i have yet to find anything that feels/is truly authentic.  everything just seems, kitchy or not good enough to be authentic and have great jaz artists.  i think i came close, in my mind at least, to finding the proper environs in this smoky little underground club on the left banc of paris.  but the artists that cam and i saw there were not totally up to par with my fantasy!"

so for much of my life i have had this fantasy that i would eventually find a jazz club that would replace in my mind the absence of me not being alive in the late 50′s and early 60′s and being black and living in NYC and therefore unable to stoll down 52d street and hear coltrane and others jamming in real-time and only for themselves.  although i’ve been all over the states, i have yet to find anything that feels/is truly authentic.  everything just seems, kitchy or not good enough to be authentic and have great jaz artists.  i think i came close, in my mind at least, to finding the proper environs in this smoky little underground club on the left banc of paris.  but the artists that cam and i saw there were not totally up to par with my fantasy!

i found my place, though, in the oddest of locations: dakar.  i know that many of you may be quite over my raving about dakar, but deal with it.  this place (picts coming soon right now there are technical difficulties) is amazing.  it is a little bar with a tiki hut thing in the middle of it with a small stage on the front right and just tables everywhere.  they are so relaxed about everything…the artists, the staff, the patrons.  brett at one point jumped on stage with a band and started playing the marraccas along with the band in the most arrogant and stupid and hillarious display of white-boy-ness that i’ve seen in….a long flipping time.  

although the environment was not closed and was not velvetty and was not terribly smokey given that it was open air and there were palm trees growing in the veranda/patio/open air area, the music made it almost complete.  the first night we were there we listened to [orchestra baobab][1].  they had this tenorman that i wanted to sire his children, he was so chill, so beat, so amazing.  the band was powerful with afro-cubano roots and a lot of straight jazz influence, it was improvisational, serene and over the top in its grandiosity. the second night we listened to [waflash][2].  she was seductive, a billy holiday of west african beats.  wonderfully relaxed, sexy environs for a nice sunday evening listen.  then the last night we heard [cheikh lo][3] who is one of the god fathers of senegalese music.  he is a drummer and a singer.  he is a rasta.  he had this nice band. he played straight senegalese music, straight west african tunes. he had crazy native dancers with him that did stuff i’ve never, ever seen the human body do. he was the spiritual leader of his entire crowd.  i drank a soda with him at via roma at 5 in the morning after his show.

on the final night we were in dakar we were walking from just for you, the main music venue where we saw all of these people, aka my jazz bar to a place called: the jazz bar which was around the corner.  there we had heard some decent reggae and had heard that this old guitar dude was supposed to go on late…on our way i found this house half way between the two on a nice quiet street. i want it. it has joined this house in the keys that i fantasize about owning whenever i pass it as one of the houses i would give most anything to own. 

dakar is THAT good. now back to talking about where i currently am: crazy, crazy Sierra Leone.
