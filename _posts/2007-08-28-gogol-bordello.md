So I heard an [NPR podcast][1] that I subscribe to the other day that blew my mind.  NPR podcasts these concerts from the famous 9:30 club in DC that I’ve been to with fisher-man a time of two.  The band, Gogol Bordello describes itself as a Gypsy Rock & Roll Machine…!  Sa-WEET.  The lead singer is from Chernobyl.  Sa-WEET.  If you want to laugh take a look at [their picture][2] on AllMusic.  Sa-WEET!!

There is this band that Highlands and I saw this summer which we both loved called [Bajofondo Tango Club][3].  I have described them elsewhere.  They were Argentine and fabulously crazy.  This bank, Gogol Bordello, does to Russia what Bajofondo do to Argentina:  rock its world with a fusion of traditional rhythms and sounds with new beats and sounds.  Gogol is more rock inspired where Bajofondo is more dance inspired, but I think that is more a reflection of the specific musical leanings of each region rather than any specific choice.  There is not much overlap between the two bands that I can type out, however there is a certain parallel of energy between the two when you listen to them.
