*   A Masai Bush Pilot attempted to convince me that rural Sudanese women were so turned on by engine noise from his craft that they would masturbate in front of him.  But only when the engines were running.
*   I became strangely choked up by the words of a departing Haitian whom I barely know.
*   I discussed the vitality of American Football in relation to Rugby and what that speaks of American v. European culture.
*   I was nearly fondled by a drunken Rwandan-Austrian who, despite his family, we are all convinced is gay.
*   I was nearly fondled by a drunken Kosovar who no one disputes is gay.
*   I was taught dance steps by a good Kenyan friend named Daniel.
*   I learned of the intricacies of kidnappings near Mogadishu and how the groups there seemingly fail to understand the integral part of such a venture: the ransom.
*   I learned of the historical reasons for Greenland remaining a colony of Denmark.
*   I was chided by a Ugandan named Daniel for not knowing some word that began with psycho and ended in gibberish.
*   I convinced a Zimbabwean acquaintance that Highlands is all of the following: decedent of Apache royalty, Tajikistani Interior Designer, Uzbekistani Fish Farmer, and currently residing in Mongolia integrated into women's martial arts training.
