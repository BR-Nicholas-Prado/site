If you’re like me, you’ve thought long and hard about desalination.  What is the problem?  Why is it taking so long for the Middle Easy countries (especially) to figure out the technology and apply the economies of scale such that desalination costs will fall for the rest of the world?  Well, [Worldwatch Institute][1] provides an update.  The summary: 

 [1]: http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5720 "Desalination Raises Environmental, Cost Concerns | Worldwatch Institute"

> Energy costs, rather than environmental concerns, have been the main  
> deterrent to desalination plant expansion. Zander said the NRC panel  
> convened with expectations that technological improvements could lower  
> the cost of desalination, but they found that the technology is nearly  
> as efficient as possible at present. The most a plant can reduce its  
> energy consumption is 15 percent, the report predicts.

It’s all worth reading though.
