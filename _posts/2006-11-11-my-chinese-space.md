news corp generally, i think, sucks.  however this is a good thing.  the problem is that there are korean and japanese "versions" of social networking that blow my space’s flat categories and horrible layouts away.  these asain sites are apparently [sic] with 3d anime that is user controlled where people build living spaces and avatars and interact in much more social ways.  myspace is flat, not very interactive, and very western….identifying yourself by your likes in certain predefined categories and then being able to "hook up" with those of the same preferences.  despite john cusak’s rant in high fidelity, it is a fairly arbitrary way to build and maintain relationships.  that aside it is a good thing if myspace can creap into the chinese market for many reasons.  any additional means of communication that chinese web users have is another way for the rest of the world to get access to the real attrocities that are going on there, if there are any.  and i’m sure there are.  i’m writing an entire paper that is, essentially, railing on the traditional way that law regulates things, how that is not exactly analogizeable to the internet, and how a different approach would work much better for the us companies, for human rights advocates, and for web users in internet suppressing countries.  congress has been extremely myopic in its one publicly contemplated response to the collusion with china by google, yahoo and microsoft.  i intend to show how a different approach, less rooted in traditional legality, would have much better results legally as well as policy-ly.  it will be out after christmas.  now back to writing.
