mongo has a new poem for taylor up on the [indiefeed PP][1] podcast, you, too, can listen with wide-eyed-conspiratorial-wonder. it is funnier than usual, even for TM. mongo also said, and i have yet to verify on TM’s site, that mali will be: (1) releasing a new album this year, & (2) will be guest hosting indiefeed.

hot shit said casey, and i gave him a detention…..on the spot. 

this poem is straightforward and reminds me of playing grenade wars with beaner using magnolia seed pods which always had the stems attached which we pulled like pins and tossed and then jumped into bushes.

in a related manner: the german-japanese are coming. but i’ll hold my position all right captain, just as sure as a man…

and in other news, just found an interview with my favorite band: [explosions in the sky][2], an austin instrumental rock quartet who have subtelties rachmaninoff would have envied.
