As I clicked the category for this posting it occurred to me that for much of the first two years of this blog all I wrote about was categorized as "living" but that for the past three years or so that has decrescendoed to almost a non-existent situation.  Maybe I have spent much more time looking outward and not so much time looking inward, or maybe I have become a bit reticent to write about "me" as I embark on something akin to being a professional.

Nevertheless, the [NY Times Magazine][1] has a great piece on shared parenting that has gotten me thinking.  First a few quotes:

> There is one pocket of American parenting in which equality is the norm or, at least, the mutually-agreed-upon goal. Same-sex couples cannot default to gender when deciding who does what at home. How these parents make their decisions, therefore, sheds some light on why married men and women act the way they do. They are the exceptions that both prove and challenge the rules.

> “Heterosexual couples can learn from gay couples about sharing housework and child care,” says Esther D. Rothblum, a professor in the women’s studies department of San Diego State University whose comparative study of the relationships of 342 couples — lesbian, gay, heterosexual — was published in the journal Developmental Psychology in January. “They are good role models.”

There are a ton of other good nuggets of wisdom in the piece.  But here is the money quote:  

> Sure, some of their tasks would fall along traditional gender lines. The point, they say, is not to spit at tradition for the heck of it but rather to think things through instead of defaulting to gender.

I think that for whatever reason that is almost exactly my world-view.  As my wedding is beginning its slow march towards reality I have been thinking a lot about gender roles, about tradition and about what the word "partner" really means to me.  

The sad news is that I have few very few answers to any of these solutions.  But I know that I am less tied to traditional views than many.  That does not mean that I eschew traditional gender roles.  At times, for whatever reason, they can be a handy resource.  When in a hurry Highlands cleans better and faster than I do (although my mother ensured that I would not be inadequate at housework, a value which many years of menial jobs reinforced).  I know things like turn on the car heater when your vehicle is overheating.  

Yet, the thing about these is when they become forced resentment brews.  I like the notion that is teased out in the article that what is important is expectations.  When those diverge and inevitably are not met resentment, frustration and anger build.  What is important?  Communicating what someone's expectations are to one's partner.  Many of the stories in the article are a bit kooky.  I do not foresee making color coded charts, but the themes of communicating expectations and embracing those that vary slightly from your own resonate very much with me.
