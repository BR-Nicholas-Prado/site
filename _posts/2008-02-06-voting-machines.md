# 

Can someone explain to me why we are even hearing about voting machines…?  How flipping difficult can the code be?  Why are these things untrustworthy?  Other than the Chinese State (with its professionals) hacking into our systems, why are we unable to figure this out?  There are a few candidates, you click one of them.  A counter counts.  Maybe I just don’t understand some nuances (which is troubling considering I’m going to do election policy and process reform), but it seems to me to be a non-issue.
