We had an epic rainstorm last night.  I had been waiting for one since we’ve moved into our compound as I was concerned about the drainage systems.  The soils here are the sandy clay stuff and because the clay makes the water not permeate the soils and because the sand makes the water flow easily, I was worried about what was happening whenever it rains.  We do a lot of gardening and are trying to keep our compound as green as possible here in the high desert.

Yet, that requires a lot of water.  And water is expensive, currently $8 per cubic meter if we truck it up or $3 per cubic meter on the nights that the water board decides to pump water into the main.  We do have a big reservoir for holding the water we use inside the house and a pump to pump it to the tanks on the roof to keep some semblance of water pressure.  We also use this water to keep our garden, orchard, bushes and trees alive.  

Our gardener is really good.  He has created a nice irrigation path for the water that comes into the compound from the hill above as well as much of the water that flows off the roof and around the compound.  Much of this water does get into the garden and orchard.  The problem is that it creates huge puddles that do eventually seep into the soil but generally deteriorate the fragile topsoils as well as create huge runoff problems, bringing all the crap into the compound from outside.  They have done their best with shovels, but now I’m going to have to bring in the heavy equipment!

Last night’s rainstorm finally gave me a chance to see how the water was running into, out of, and around the compound.  We found four places where it will be useful and where we are able to build rainwater retention reservoirs.  These will capture the rainwater and let us use it to keep the garden alive with in the between rains.  It will also keep the massive pools of water from wreaking havoc on the top soil.  So we cited and sized the locations for the four new reservoirs.  We went out this morning to purchase most of the equipment we’ll need to dig the two primary reservoirs.  Since it came out of my pocket, I’m going to have to wait until another paycheck to do the final two.  And now we are in the process of creating these things.  

This is the part of living in a developing country that I love.  The freedom to do what you want and know is right; the interaction with people who know different things than you do; and the realization that everything is essentially the same if you look hard enough for it.  You may have to do a lot of things yourself, but that is also exciting to me.  In the States I call someone and they provide me a service.  Here it is not so easy.  Since we’ve moved into this compound I’ve been a plumber or supervised VERY closely another plumber, I’ve also been or supervised electricians, carpenters, IT consultants, glass dealers, gardeners, hydrologic engineers, structural engineer, construction engineer, mechanical engineer, interior designer and many other trades that I never would have had the opportunity to become elsewhere.  

Supervising the building of these reservoirs will serve as the beginning of my learning curve for my next major project: building the first pool in this country and making it solar/wind powered and chemical free using a new salt chlorination system.

But first, back to my day job.
