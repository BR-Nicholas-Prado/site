There is simply no other word that I can conjure.  

I would like to remind everyone that McCain is 73 and has had two, three or four incidents with cancer.  McCain has lived a tough life.  The Presidency routinely causes men not with white hair to go white as an indication of the stresses that are placed on one's body.  I know momma McCain is 92 or whatever, but she wasn't a Prisoner of War, didn't routinely have large amounts of G-force placed on her body over a significant portion of her adult life and didn't spend the rest of her adult life fighting, scrapping, and arguing with everyone and their brother on the hill.  

After knowing that.  Please watch this.
