*If You Want Change, You Have to Change Congress* 
Lawrence Lessig

In a desire for some thing a bit different, I have decided that instead of copying and pasting and annotating that I would share my pen markings.  I often print articles which I want to sit down with and take some time with.  I print them two pages per sheet on my A4 paper.  (That is the paper which the rest of the world uses instead of Letter).  

I scanned my pen markings, which one could easily argue is a bit of laziness on my part.  And maybe it is.  Indeed, figuring out how to continue to engage online while still doing my job, growing my businesses, being married, and trying to carve out a bit of time for myself has been a challenge recently.  So I have embarked on a mission of efficiency in how I spend my time whilst sat in front of a computer screen.  

Without further adieu.
