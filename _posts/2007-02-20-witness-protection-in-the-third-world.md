Today I would like to soapbox about something not really close to my heart but that I’ve been pondering lately.  How is protecting high-profile witnesses here different than it is in developed countries?  I mean I’ve seen Joe Dirt and therefore I know most of what there is to know about witness protection in the US.  But I don’t know anything about it here.  Let’s explore.

In some ways it may be easier to hide and protect a witness in a developing country.  The lack of a virtual or real paper-trail may make certain things, such as identity creation, easier.  The lack of credit cards and the imposition of a completely cash based economy also enhances anonymity.  Without having to change credit cards and bank accounts and deeds to property and all the other bread-crumbs of identity that a normal person in the developing world leaves throughout their virtual and real travels, it is easier to make someone reappear.  It may raise eyebrows if someone pays for a plane ticket in cash in the US; whereas, here it is impossible to pay for something with a credit card.  That said, once authorities get the new identity created, it is likely about the same in either a cash-based or in a credit-based economy.

Around here compounds are frequent.  This, again, enhances an authority’s ability to protect “insider” witnesses who are genuinely worried about reprisals for their cooperation with investigations and trials.  In a situation where there are not many compounds, emplacing one may raise more eyebrows than in a place like this where everyone who can afford it lives in a compound and everyone who cannot lives in a shack.  There is no in between.  Either you have a wall topped with razor wire or broken glass, with bars on your windows, massive locks on your doors and guards at your gates or you live in a shack hopefully near the streams so you can do your washing easily.  When I was a child riding my bike around and saw a walled place, I would find a way to look inside.  Here the compounds are so frequent that I cannot imagine that I would have bothered to care as a Sierra Leonean child.  This prevalence of security areas makes it easier to protect someone.  

So in some ways the absence of a real infrastructure and large middle class make it easier for authorities to make someone disappear (in a good way, not in the other way).  Yet there are other ways which make it more difficult to make someone disappear.  

To a certain extent the developing world’s connectedness has created a situation where it is dislocated from its real environment and surroundings.  At home I rarely, if ever, talk to my neighbours or know the people I’m passing as I walk around.  Here I’m forced to learn the faces for security reasons and because it is construed as rude if I do not remember them from the last time we chatted.  Because I’m an anomaly and because everyone looks at the white boy who walks to the market every night and remembers my name, I feel socially compelled to remember as many of their names as I can.  My lack of anonymity stems from more than merely my skin color, though.  It also comes from the fact that here people have absolutely nothing to divert them.  I see the same people every night when I walk to the market because they, unfortunately, have nowhere else to go, and thus, are semi-imprisoned in their own surroundings.  

The lack of movies, TV, electricity, book stores, parks & concerts means that people are left to talk — communicating and gossiping is about all you are left with when the other diversions are absent and your work is finished for the day.  The lack of the diversions simultaneously restricts the options that local people here have to talk about.  It is a running joke in my office that Americans talk about movies too much, but that is all we know; here all people know is other people.  This human connectedness, I think, may make it more difficult to provide useful and true witness protection.  It may be easier to create a persona by moving to a different locale in the third world.  The problem is that secrets, once out, spread through the bush quicker than Page Six could ever hope to move rumours about celebrities.  

People love their news here.  It is likely their only source of diversion or break from the monotony of their normal workaday.  There are radio stations.  During the evening you can hear the five stations blasting through cheap, imported radios wherever you are in Freetown.  During the mornings you can see the cheap newspapers sold by the men who have very little else to do with their lives for US$.30 or so.  These newspapers are habitually and blatantly wrong about so many things.  Here, I think that the media can be easily cajoled.  Because corruption is so rife the people with an end in mind can further that by paying off newspapermen.  A little money goes a long way.  

Where there is a dearth of reliable or contradictory evidence than, of course, people will take it at face value.  People do that in the states where they have much better access to “alternative” media outlets.  In terms of witness protection, this likely cuts both ways.  I think that whoever gets their hands in the pockets of the newspaper editors in the city of relocation first will be the ones who will be able to control whether it makes it into the media that this person has arrived in the city (with a picture), the reliance on media may prevail and it may be extraordinarily easy for the seekers to find the individual.  If the authorities can pay off the newspaper first so that there is no mention of the sought-after witness then the lack of alternatives may prevail and it would be fairly easy to retain the anonymity.  

So what is the answer?  Maybe the answer is different here than in developed countries.  My notion of witness protection in the US is, concededly tainted by Hollywood notions, but it seems to me that you achieve a new identity and then assurances of that anonymity by becoming part of the masses.  By just being another schlub who drives a Ford Explorer and goes to work five days a week, the mall on Saturday and the golf course on Sunday no one will ask questions.  The people who may be looking for retribution will not really be able to ask a lot of questions if someone lives in a medium-size city and varies where he or she shops and goes to.  The lack of human connections makes it much harder to track someone down by human intelligence measures.  In distinction to this, in the developing world maybe you have to remove someone from the masses.  These people exist here and no one really knows who is behind the blacked out glass.  I think that the trick boils down to removing the witness from the scene entirely and not allowing him or her to be seen by many people.  The curiosity factor is high, but generally people cannot be bothered to care if you don’t give them a reason to do.
