most of you know where i want to go with my career.  this has been cemented over the course of the summer and my participation in both meaningless and meaningful litigation and policy development here in the US.  my platform: assisting developing countries in pulling themselves out of poverty without mortgaging their environments to do so.

the following excerpt is from a [council on foreign relations publication][1] on the nuclear deal the US cut with India to establish a commercial (thereby non-weapons grade or adaptable) nuclear deal where the US will help India establish a nuclear program.  i think that these types of programs are positives in stable governments, but we shouldn’t be rushing to make them.  in a stable government transparency breeds accountability.  but in an unstable government such a program would merely injest an unnecessary skill set into a population group that may use it for non-commercial practices.  i think that if we use this as a carrot/stick approach in our outlook to developing followup programs with other developing countries we will be OK.  what i don’t really think is right, and i think what this guy is arguing, is that this sort of deal should be a paradigm for our future energy dealings with other nations.  i hesitate to christen any sort of "deal" as a paradigm when it is between countries.  treaties and intergovernmental contracts are not bridges that flow from a single paradigm and are modified to fit the specifics of the dirt structure and width that must be spanned.  these these are too societally dependent and when we try to establish paradigms or iconic deals we only set ourselves up for failures b/c we will inevitably discount the next deal and not thoroughly think through all the parameters that must be analyzed in the negotiation phase.  in short we will just base it on the last deal, b/c that one worked.  this laziness seems to happen a lot in politics and foreign relations and what i am wholeheartedly opposed to.  so here is the quote:

I admit to not having researched the "Partnership" that he cites at the end of the passage.  I know this much, if we keep basing our energy requirements upon coal we are not really going to get anywhere.  keeping coal production stationary without anything more is only going to hurt, even if we keep up with rising energy demands by substituting that additional delta with nuclear (therefore non-carbon emitting) energy.  this is for two reasons, one: the coal is going to likely get dirtier.  this has been happening over the past three decades as coal producers have seen a decrease in the BTU’s per ton of coal b/c it is not as "good" of coal.  most of the established mines are beginning to get the dregs and new exploration and development costs capital.  if i was in the energy industry (which is oxymoronic) i would sink all my capital investment money that i could spare into something else since the political and regulatory regime is inevitably going to get rockier in the next five to ten years.  there is too much risk there.  this flows into the second reason why we need to reduce and not to contain the amount of coal we use in energy production.  people (and the more likely players in my model, at least in america: the insurance companies, once the legal system actually holds them accountable for paying for the hurricanes and stops them from evading those payouts) are going to get sick of it.  they are going to eventually hold some political system accountable when the links are clearly established and the green left finally puts it all together into a cohesive package (rove style).

ok that is all for now.  this is deeply integrated in my mind: enviroments, trade, geopolitics, policies, economics, societies and cultural sytems.  i hope to keep blogging more on these themes and less on other banalities.
