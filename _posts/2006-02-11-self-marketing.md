so there are these sites.  some of you know of them.  friendster. my space. facebook.com.  they are all pretty much the same thing.  they are sites that allow you to tell people about your self:  fav movies, fav music, fav TV, quotes, "about me," and other blase things.  

first you create yourself.  just like any other document (real or fake, static or dynamic) you choose which aspects of yourself to accentuate and whatever.  

after you have created yourself then you find friends.  many times one of your friends will have beaten you to the site and will already have created themself on the site.  sometimes you will be the first of your close friends.  whatever.  so then you ask them to be your little online friend.  and then they accept.

once you have friends then you start to leave little funny messages on each other’s "walls" (bulletin boards, etc.).  mostly they are responsive so if someone is looking at your page they will only get half the story and thus be confused.

you can then really mess the process up.  you can start to blog on these sites.  you can add pictures to the sites.  you can tag said pictures with your friends names so the pictures show up on their sites.  you can tell your entire community of friends about parties or plans.  you can take it to the next level by getting third-party add on templates which will fuck with the page’s CSS code to make it highly annoying to people like me.  you can add songs.  

it is fucking crazy.

BUT, the craziness of it is not what i want to talk about on this not sunny, not cloudy, not cold, not warm, not spring, not summer saturday afternoon.  what i really want to talk about is how people choose to portray themselves.

first you can read an article from a blogger who i’ve been reading for a few years.  she put it better than i can.  but i would like to update and respond to some of what she has said.

i have noticed some trends.  people tend to choose one way to portray themselves:  ironic, straightup, post-ironic, fun, withheld, intellectual, whatever the case may be.

i guess that is it.  and i cannot find the article.  so this sux.  sorry for wasting your time.
