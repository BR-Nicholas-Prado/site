Koroma sure talks a good game.  I’m a bit cynical, but yet hesitantly optimistic at the same time.  So far no reports of violence during the cabinet changeover, but the hope mandate will likely extend for more months, if not through the middle of next year.  You can hear Koroma’s interview for NPR (BBC in the US…sort of) at the link below.
