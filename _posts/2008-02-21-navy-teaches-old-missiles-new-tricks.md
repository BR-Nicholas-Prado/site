I’m not sure why, but this whole deal fascinates me.  The Navy re-programmed its intercept missiles (which were built to intercept anti-ship missiles launched from Russian planes in the event of full scale war against the Soviets) to take out satellites in space.  Maybe it is my love of Spies Like Us, but if it only took the Navy three weeks to perform the software calibration on these things then that means that it either wasn’t that complicated or that they had been working on it for much longer than they are releasing.  My theory is that it isn’t that complicated, because satellites should be easier to track and know where they are in 3-Ds then missiles launched.
