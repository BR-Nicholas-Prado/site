the following things happened during my evening hike today:  i was startled by a fairly large brown bear when i rounded the corner and there he/she was 15 yards from me.  luckily she/he sauntered off.  i gave blood to the mosquito blood bank of the roaring fork valley….don’t they know i’ve been given the anthrax and small pox vaccinations and cannot give blood for another five years.  i startled a beaver and he made a pop sound with his tail and for a while i couldn’t figure out what had happened until i saw his dam and his house, which were directly in front of me the entire time.

and i almost hit bambi’s mom on the drive home.  eventful, beautiful.

watched school of rock again tonight because i’d been singing led zeppelin to myself most of the hike, when i wasn’t day dreaming.  and face it, we all need our jack black fix from time to time.
