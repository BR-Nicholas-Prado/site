Some initial thoughts.  It is 6:30 in the morning here and I've now been up all night, so maybe this will not be as eloquent or complete as I'd like.

McCain did well on FP, as was to be expected.  His best answer was on Georgia when he said that this was largely about energy and (didn't say but meant) that this is important to Putin in order to entrench himself.  He shine when talking about Ukraine and the need to stabilize it while hoping to keep it as an ally to counterbalance growing Russian strength.

Obama did well on FP, probably better than expectations.  His best answer was on Iran when he spoke about how the invasion of Iraq took away the regional counterbalance and thus strengthened their position in the short term and medium term vis a vis the region.  

On Iran, they are both going the same way, just from different angles.  They want and need a regional counterbalance to Iranian influence.  Obama says we never should have gone into Iraq, McCain says we needed the surge.  They are both right about one and about the other, but their arguments miss each other because they are taking into account different temporal timeframes which require different consideration.  Obviously both know that, but these are their stump positions.  

The economy half was pure stump for both.  No surprises big surprises there.  Except McCain considering a suspension of spending, which if you noticed the second time he hedged from defense, VA and entitlements to defense, VA and critical (or vital, not sure) areas.  I'm not sure how he would classify vital areas any more than how Obama plans to quantify combat troops in his 16 month pledge.  But am not bothered, it is political and not substantive.

Random other observations.  I have CNN here and they had the red blue green real time reaction.  I never saw green reaction for McCain go about the second line.  And I rarely saw the red go above that line.  A couple of times when he tugged at heart-strings it got close to being above for the red.  The green and the blue were largely tracking each other through most of the debate.  There were divergences when Obama would attack Bush.  But for the most part they were flowing together.

I think that Republicans will identify the number of times Obama pointed to areas of agreeance as a weakness or naivete area of Obama.  I enjoyed them.  Perhaps it is a difference of style.

I thought that McCain's patronizing of Obama was a bit overboard.  Fine one or two times say you don't get it, but nearly every answer that he gave was that way.  Not sure how it will play with voters, but the green line in the hall seemed to be turned off almost every time he said it.  

I was also struck by the shear about of mischaracterizations that McCain made of Obama's record.  I did not hear or do not remember but once or twice McCain have to parse Obama's words to clarify the record and recover from an attack.  I remember many many more times where that was the case.  

I was struck by McCain's answer on 9/11.  It was an open-ended question.  I heard him in the summer of 2006 give an excellent answer to a similar question where he talked about the root causes of terrorism and how those need to be addressed.  He spoke of poverty in Ramallah as well as how the Saudi system of government needs to be addressed with strength by the President, etc.  Views that are espoused by most main stream foreign policy realists.  Tonight's answer, and what I've heard him say on the trail is very different.  Much more neo-con.  I am not sure if he has gotten handled, there is some political coalition building going on or whether now that he is running for President he can assert some latent self that he could not as a Senator.  Whatever the case, he has seemingly drastically changed from what I perceived to be standard realist notions about the world to quite aggressive neo-con notions.  To include the League of Democracies.  It is absolutely idiotic, and every european I've talked to agrees.  So not sure who is going to join his League.  We already have enough international institutions.  We need to be clarifying and streamlining what they do rather that building more.  Here is a question.  How much of McCain's spending cuts will he need in order to facilitate the budget of the League of Democracies which will sit along side the G-8 and SC that currently fill the role he is looking to replace?  Will he keep funding the budgets of the secretariats of those two IOs and add a third?  It is cognitive dissonance to me.  But I have happily drunk the kool-aid so maybe I'm not the most objective observer.

Obama's answers seemed to show him as what everyone perceives him to be an internationalist realist.  He did, and has all along, stressed non-proliferation.  And he is right that it is a major threat.  He did well not to back down on missile defense, but I wished he would have tied it in a bit better to his answer on the Russia question rather than on the 9/11 question.  I agree with him about small-scale WMDs being the major threat to homeland security.  I think that he was distancing himself from WMDs as a word and focusing on nuclear weapons as a political maneuver.  

Most rich moment of the debate was when McCain tried to tie Obama to Bush.  How much of a hot potato has he become?  Obama tried throughout to tie McCain to Bush.  McCain tried throughout to distance himself from Bush.  It was hilarious.  

I saw Biden give Obama campaign spin after the debate.  He did his thing.  Preceding him was a senior staffer from the McCain camp.  McCain: unleash the pit bull.  I want to see what she's got.  Looking forward to next Thursday.

So we'll have to see how it plays politically.  Neither hit it out of the park.  Neither made any big gaffes.  Largely I was bored as much of it was stump and only towards about Russia did they actually get off the stump and talk any substance.  

Now to my bed.

UPDATE: They are both wrong.  The surge would technically be classified as neither a strategy nor a tactic.  It was an operational response designed to achieve a strategic objective.  So it was an operation.
