during the first month i was in africa i did not want to leave.  i was trolling the internet trying to figure out a way that i could stay in west africa.  i looked for jobs in salone, liberia, guinea, ghana, wherever, just to stay there.  i didn’t care if they paid or not, i didn’t care if they were prestigious or not.  as time grew on and i became more and more embroiled in the work i was doing and more and more frustrated with west africa my desires waned.  at the beginning i think it was more a manifestation of my frustration with the states, nashville, law school, etc. than it was a desire to never leave africa again.  

over time my feelings about africa turned from an infatuation into something like a better understand more akin to love where faults are recognized rather than painted over and beauty becomes completely subjective.  

one of the jobs that i researched at the beginning and would have considered doing throughout my waxes and wanes of desire to stay (but wouldn’t have done in the end as i came to europe for other reasons) was to monitor the elections that were originally supposed to be in july and have now been pushed back to august.  i emailed the carter group as well as the national democratic institute to see if either of them was monitoring the elections (nDi was) and if they needed help/volunteers/interns (they didn’t at the time, but that was early february).  ever since i arrived it was a hot button issues and whenever i was talking to saloneans and i ran out of topics like the weather and the fact that i was white but not likely to be able to sponsor their education in london through the graduate level and world news, i would turn to politics.  they were always happy to engage in a nice political debate and to give you their perspective on the political landscape as they saw it.  it was funny how authoritative they would speak about it.  i have since realized how "african" their speeches were.  they would nearly always begin at the beginning and give me the entire landscape with all its attendent complicating and simplifying factors from the 1968 elections up to the currently scheduled election, the traditional lines of support and the various tribal and chiefdom factors as they applied traditionally and currently.  one thing that struck me is how simple, yet complex within a given culture and situation, the game of politics is.  it is very straightforward and seemingly easy to play.  yet one must still remain within the systemic and cultural constraints, and these often provide the complications.  

the international crisis group has just yesterday published a [report][1] about the upcoming elections.   if you are interested in a western synopsis of the above, granted without the flair of the happy krio accent and grandiose hand gestures.

there are three main candidates: solomon berewa, charles margai and ernest koroma.  berewa is the current vice-president, leader of the SLPP and current frontrunner.  he generally represents a semi-compentence with a bit of international credibility, yet he has essentially been running the country since 2002 and so represents the status quo to many saloneance.  margai is the old gadfly who has been buzzing about salone politics for years, formerly SLPP and currently the leader of the newly formed PMDC.  he seems to have much to prove and overly eager, there is something about him that seethes corruption to me.  koroma is the wild-card and head of the APC.  no one seems very sure of him, although he is a bit younger than the others they all represent (to most saloneans i spoke with) shades of gray.  no one brings any true hope or really engages the imagination of the people.  this is a shame on all levels i can possibly think of.
