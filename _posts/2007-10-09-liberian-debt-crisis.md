[![Bono][2]][2]Although I think that Bono’s typical analysis of third-world debt is in many cases flat and unnuanced, it is important to look at.  At least that analysis that gets reported in the press.  The LiveAid concert series was the first time I began to think actively about the topics of poverty and from my current perspective is a watershed moment.  I kept thinking, "yeah, but…" where the ellipses were filled with different theories of mixed carrots and sticks.

Since then, and since coming to law school my analytical abilities and knowledge of the both the problems and possible solutions have been slightly refined.  I am very, very ignorant on this topic, but I have been able to form philosophical views on a few third-world poverty issues and back those up with real reasoning, something that I couldn’t do on the sunny sunday afternoon in Aspen with the mountains behind me and my deck to sit on, smoke and think while the TV behind me blared Green Day and Bruce Springsteen and other left leaning celebrities who didn’t really know what they were arguing for except that they were getting widespread coverage.  

One thing that I now think is that there are countries it is worth saving.  That statement has a lot of nuances to it, I realize, but suffice it for here because I have to go to class soon, that Liberia is one of those countries.  Take the time to tell the IMF that Liberia is worth saving if you agree with what is written by[ this dude][2].

This should not be read to be an indictment of Bono’s analytical skills, cause everyone that knows me knows that I totally want to be Bono.
