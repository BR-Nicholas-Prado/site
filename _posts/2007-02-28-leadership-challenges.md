This ![160207_0812][1]post is long overdue.  But forgive me, it took a while for me to have a chance to pull the pictures off my phone.  Let me introduce you to the people that have a chance, everyday, to steal my shit and for some reason do not.

When I was in the Marine Corps, we had a saying that there were no bad Marines, simply bad leaders.  It is was a bit self-deprecating of Marine officers to take all the blame for psychotic Marines and their actions, but it is one of the many things that make the USMC such a great organization.  We tempered the saying when we were around the Marines who were trouble by calling them "leadership challenges."  

[![140207_0804][3]][3]since i’ve been here my dreams have been riddled with USMC references.  this, i’m sure is due to a lot of things.  not the least of which is the larium which turns my dreams most nights into a kaliedoscopic cinema that i never experience without drugs. usually, i rarely think about the marine days.  in a lot of ways i have closed that part of my life off.  there was a lot to it.  it made me, for better or worse, the human i am today. but i’ve moved on mentally and philosophically.  and yet i keep dreaming with references to those times and those feelings that i experienced during my nine year interaction with that institution.  much of it, i’m sure is that i’m an intern at a war crimes tribunal working a case that is in the pre-trail stages.  all i do all day long is read about war.

[![160207_0813][4]][4] but there is another reason, i think as well.  that is that i’m forced to use a lot of the leadership techniques that i developed as a marine officer.  the help around the house is not that much different than an infantryman and, frankly, dealing with my "staff" (for lack of a less pejorative term i’ll rest on that term) feels the same.  i think those three things all cut towards having lots of USMC references in my dream-scape.  but i’ve rattled too much, now to the introductions.

first there is martha (spelled, pronounced like a rasta would say matter…ma-TA).  she runs the entire show.  she cleans, washes, coordinates everything.  a couple of months before we arrived she had a baby.  after she got pregnant her b/f left her.  she, apparently, didn’t care.  she was just so happy to have a child on the way, b/c before this latest b/f she was married for a few years and could not concieve.  she was shunned by her family and his. finally they got divorced, citing the lack of children as the primary reason.  so when she became pregnant, finally, she felt vindicated of everything people had spoken about her.  she told me that she didn’t even care when her b/f left her.  she named her daughter blessing.  i named her story, bible-esque.  blessing is quiet…i have yet to hear an african baby cry, not once, they seem to have the silent resolve of everyone around here bred rather than beat into them…and cute as can be.

[![240207_1706][5]][5]next there is ibrahim, our caretaker.  we have settled on a supervision scheme wherein i’m responsible for supervising the outside the house guys and another housemate is responsible for the inside the house ladies.  so far, it is working out fine.  ibrahim is not a bad guy, but he is lazy.  again, no different than all the marines i knew.  he pressed me at the beginning of when i took over supervision of him. when i called him out and corrected him, he fell in line just fine.  i am very clear and precise with him. i don’t ask a lot out of his cognizance. and it is fine.  we haven’t had a single issue with him not being around or available or not meeting a deadline since i’ve taken over responsibility.  a little hands on goes a long ways. ibrahim has a wife and a three y/o son, but he stays many nights at the house.  he is honest and i would trust him with nearly anything i own, which is good b/c he carries a keyring full of every key to every door in the house!  he speaks quite good english, and sometimes has to work as my krio interpreter.

the next pict is of patricia.  patricia is the cook for one of our housemates.  she doesn’t cook for brett and i, but we are thinking of hiring her for a little while.  our housemate is leaving for a few weeks to return to the states and patricia is the only breadwinner for her family that has three boys.  unfortunately her husband was recently laid off due to lack of work (i’m not sure what he did).  her boys come with her as they go to school down the street.  they are 11, 8, and 6.  also very cute and respectful little dudes.  i get a kick out of them.  my main interactions with patricia are as my krio (pronounced similar to creole, only faster and lazier) teacher.  every morning she teaches me some new krio or reminds me of what i forgot that she told me the day before.  

finally we get to "the boys."  unfortunately i only have a picture of one of the boys, fouday (pronounced "foodie").  that is him sitting outside the gate to our compound reading his textbooks and waiting for me to come back from the market with his coke.  we have three night gaurds that rotate.  each night only two of them are on. we have one main day guard, and one that comes during his days off.  the day guard i rarely get a chance to talk to, as mornings are usually filled with me telling ibrahim what i need him to do during the day and other errands.  the night, guards, however i’ve gotten fairly close to.  they call me school teacher, b/c they say when i’m talking to them i adopt these speech patterns that remind them of a lecturer.  it is the only way i know how to talk so that they can understand, though.  

fouday is in college studying to be an accountant.  he is a wily little one, but friendly and trustworthy.  frankly he is the only one of the bunch that has any initiative.  he was the second person in his constituency to register to vote when that started earlier this week.  he is in school every morning and works for us at least five nights a week.  he tells me he has a girlfriend, but the others aren’t so sure as no one has been able to see this young lady before.

francis. oh francis.  i wish i had a picture of him, as he is a piece of work!  francis is the most emotional non-french-man i’ve ever met. in fact he might be the most emotional man i’ve ever met.  when he talks, he talks EXACTLY like a southern baptist preacher talks. exactly. and yet i can never understand what the fuck he is saying.  he has the most distinct krio accent of any of them.  i still can usually only make out the gist of what he is saying, so most of his nuances are lost on me.  francis’s twin sister just passed away two days ago and he will be up-country for a couple of days for the funeral.  she died giving birth, and the baby is currently living, but mama has passed on.  it is really sad and horrible.  but it is life here.  francis told me earlier this week (pre-sister’s death, when happy francis was with us) that he was reserving who to vote for in the election until god spoke to him.  he said we have no president, god is our president, only He can lead us…or something to that effect, again, the nuances are usually lost.  i thought that he hadn’t been told by his preacher who to vote for yet…but will be soon! francis is very religious (obviously). he is also very superstitious. his father is what is called a paramount chief of Bo district, in the eastern part of the country (here they divide up the chiefdoms, which are presided over by chiefs (think counties) and then districts, which are presided over by paramount chiefs (think states) and has seven wives.  francis is one of 19 (i think) children of his father. 19. shit.

and finally there is prince.  prince is shorter than the other guys and he always wears this chicago bulls winter cap. i always tease him about how hot it is here and why the hell is he wearing that hat.  prince was really quiet when we first arrived. in fact the first full night i was here i went out to visit with the guards and he was reading Gone With the Wind under a light near the gate.  he didn’t really talk for the first two weeks, but now he is opening up.  he and i talk about the stars.  he comes from a village in the northern part of the country.  he told me about eclipses and how nothing good comes after them.  he told me of the few african constellations. he finished Gone with the Wind and I gave him a book that I brought over about the CIA setting up the Shah in the 50′s in Iran.  he really likes it so far.  

well that is it for now. the introductions are made and now i can speak about them without making the requisite backstory.
