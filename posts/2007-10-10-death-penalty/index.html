That aside, I fail to see outside the heat of the moment passions why a victim would care specifically that someone die.  Yes there are so many holes in that statement that an infant could argue through it.  That said, I return to an argument explored above.  There has been no great public outcry by victim’s families in the majority of states in the US who do not have the death penalty.  If it was really that poignant to victim’s families that the perpetrator die than I think you would have strong pro-death penalty rallies.  It isn’t like Republicans (now I fail to see why this is, necessarily, a traditionally conservative political platform, but it has been drawn under the umbrella of being a Republican without a doubt) have no ability to organize a campaign they care strongly about.  See Pro-Life.  Further, isn’t an eye for an eye Old Testament and turn the other cheek New Testament?   </p><p>And,lastly: It costs more to try someone in a death penalty case than in a life imprisonment.  It costs more to the degree than on sum it costs more to kill someone than to imprison them for their life.  Yes, that includes the costs of imprisoning them for life.  I will find the statistics later. </p><p>Somehow Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Burundi, Gabon and Mali are very close to a complete abolition of the penalty.  And here we are.  Although I think it is a dubious legal argument, it is an extremely strong public policy argument: </p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;A total of 133 UN member states, from all regions in the world, have<br>abolished the death penalty in law or in practice. Only 25 countries<br>carried out executions in 2006, 91 percent of them in just six<br>countries: China, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Sudan and the USA. Those that<br>chose this most cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment are<br>increasingly in the minority.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Is that the list we want to be in?  In all of Africa, the most violent continent in the world there were only six countries who legally sanctioned executions as a criminal penalty in 2006. </p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>611 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2007-10-10 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-10-13-updated-gambia/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
