and then they justify this comment by talking about wide roads, good transportation and a grid system.  now, i’m not an urban planner, but i can tell you that freetown may just be the worst designed city i’ve ever lived in, save for parts of D.C. </p><p>in a city like this with a massive unemployment problem, transportation may not be as important as a highly employed population, yet those that are employed have problems getting around.  throughout the past entries i’ve made oblique references to poda podas [pronounced with a long &ldquo;o&rdquo; and a short &ldquo;a&rdquo;].  these are mini-vans that have been stripped and replace with bench seats in rows.  they rarely have doors on them and they are brightly painted with slogans.  usually on the back windows they have &ldquo;city boy&rdquo; in a smattering of bright colors.  on the sides and usually below the windows in the back will be the name of the &ldquo;company&rdquo; that runs the poda poda, usually some variation on the &ldquo;A & T Tours&rdquo; or &ldquo;Touba Tours&rdquo; or &ldquo;Sesay Tours.&rdquo; </p><p>On the front above the grill and below the windshield are more slogans.  these, we think, are the trademarks of the particular poda poda (like naming your boat &ldquo;occupational hazard&rdquo; – which is a jimmy buffett song and my favorite boat name).  the slogans range from &ldquo;fear me&rdquo; to &ldquo;fear judgment day&rdquo; to &ldquo;allah is great&rdquo; to &ldquo;all good things come in time.&rdquo;  they usually have a religious theme (as that is the only thing that allows many here to retain some modicum of hope). </p><p>where the side door usually is there will be a guy hanging out and screaming repeatedly and as fast as he possibly can where the damn thing is headed so you’ll be walking down the narrow, poorly (and british) designed streets and you’ll hear &ldquo;lumlylumlylumlylumlylumly&rdquo; and then probably will get honked at a couple of times.  some of the drivers trick out their poda podas even more with flashing bulbs and fancy horns. </p><p>most of the populace packs themselves in these for a couple of cents per leg of their trip.  you see these things roll past with literally (i know i’m prone to exageration but i’m not here) over twenty people per poda poda.  all of them sit passively, accepting whatever fate (delivery, braking down, robbery, etc.) awaits them on the journey -  usually dressed beautifully and not sweating half as much as the white boy walking on the street with all the air in the world cooling him off. </p><p>there are a few big buses, but i’m not sure what they do.  there is no other system of mass transport in this city.  it is ridiculous in my mind that people have to pack in these damn poda podas.  at least they provide a lot of jobs for the driver and screamer for each vehicle, but this city essentially only has four roads for the majority of the town and why there are not regular bus routes i have no clue.  it certainly would help mobility.  if the roads were better designed bikes could also be used much easier.  it is hilly here but less hilly than sf or other hilly towns i’ve been to in california and elsewhere where people bike consistently.  so i don’t particularly get it.  bikes may be a large expenditure, sure, but i’m surprised there isn’t a bike NGO here started by some portland bike crew…there seems to be an NGO of every other flavor that i can fathom…all of them and no positive progress, mind-blowing.</p><p>but us rich white people?  we take charters.  poda podas are also called cabs or taxis.  charters are what we know everywhere else as cabs.  the notable things about the cabs in freetown is that most of them are driven by ex-combatants.  one of the attendant annexes to the announced peace accord (the last one of the four or two, depending upon how one counts) contained clauses that accounted cabs for combatants.  so due to this most of the time we are being driven around by ex-rebels.  makes one feel safe.  most of the time it is fine, but there have a been a few experiences, late and night with a hooker in the other front seat, me and maybe some others in the back seats looking the driver playing Salone music through shitty speakers at full volume, usually the driver is toking on some weed…i get these surreal visions of this is what is would have been like for these guys during the war…although they would have been walking and carrying an AK rather than driving, but essentially it is the same.  maybe i’m imagining, maybe i’m overly romanticizing war, maybe when the moon glistens off their black skin and bulging muscles some latent homo-eroticism arises out of my subconscious.  i don’t know.  it is fleeting, but odd.  there are a few other times when i get these surreal visions of &ldquo;this is what it was like during the war&rdquo; (minus the carnage), sometimes when i see someone on a dirt bike riding helmet-less and be-sun-glassed at a torrid pace through the freetown streets it happens, sometimes when we are out and i see the small big men with their women and their people it happens.  i usually have to do a double take to realign my reality to where and when i am.  after that i’m ok, but there are times when it hits harder the causes and and realities of why the war began, why it lasted so long, why it was waged the way that it was waged….</p><p>self-righteous paragraph: all of this stokes my theories of development at &ldquo;all costs.&rdquo;  opportunity is what most people i’ve talked to hear want.  all else comes secondary, and if they are my age or older they’ve resigned themselves usually to a lack of opportunity but want to see it for their children.  i want to do what i can to provide these equalized opportunities allocated on a meritocritous basis for these taxicab drivers and poda poda screamers and crazy people who dare to ride their bikes to their shitty little jobs so that their children may have a chance to be a doctor or lawyer or teacher or something equally as prestigious.  whatever.  i can pat myself on the back all i want, but the bottom line is to make some positive difference in whatever my sphere of influence may be and today, so far, i haven’t so now i need to stop typing and start doing.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>1128 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2007-05-09 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-05-11-irreconcilable/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
