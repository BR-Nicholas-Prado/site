(2) The action was perpetrated on the territory of one of the state parties. (3) Either the territory where the action took place or the nationality of the actor must concede jurisdiction on a case by case basis.  None of those things happened with regards to the US actors in Iraq.</p><p>However, with regards to the Brits and Aussies who are, actually, world citizens and a part of the ICC, their nationals were subject to the jurisdiction of the ICC.  That means that the prosecutor had the power to investigate their soldiers.</p><p>Now all this is a prelude to my point.  I am intrigued by what he says.  He says that there was a basis for a reasonable belief that crimes were commited, but that the gravity of the crimes was low enough that he was not going to pursue an investigation.  Everyone gets so wrapped around the axel on Iraq, and rightly so, it is a quagmire.  However, it is telling when he says that the number of victims of crimes in Iraq totals in the dozens (less than forty total).  In the three cases where he has actually pursued full investigations (two of which led to indictments and one has a case starting soon) the number of victims totals in the thousands or millions.  This disparity is so huge and is completely missed by the media.  We spend so much of our media attention on Iraq and other things (NaSA love triangles I hear is currently popular for infotainment) and so very little on the real humanity of the situation.</p><p>That is about all I have to say about that.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>395 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2007-02-07 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-02-08-o-the-banality-of-it-all/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
