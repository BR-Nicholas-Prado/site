[(Photo: Chip Somodevilla/Getty.)][2] </p><p>[Andrew Sullivan][3] has some phenomenal reactions about Barack’s seeming win up today.  The first is a story that choked me up told by one of Andrew’s [readers][4]: </p><blockquote><p>My grandfather, 86 years old and a veteran of WWII, just<br>gave me a call. He was calling all of his grandchildren to let them<br>know what an important night this was in the history of our country.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Grandpa drove a truck for over 50 years, and he told the story of<br>how he drove with a team of drivers, 2 white (including him), and 4<br>black. When they stopped at the truck stops, the black drivers had to<br>use seperate restrooms and showers, and had to eat in a small room in<br>the back of the kitchen. Grandpa and his co-driver would eat in the<br>back with the rest of the team, and while they didn’t speak of it at<br>the time, they knew it was wrong yet felt powerless to change it, and<br>believed that it would never change.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Tonight, he told me, we have come full-circle. Many people,<br>especially the younger generation who supported Obama, will never fully<br>realize the historical import of what happened tonight. But he wanted<br>his grandchildren to know this story that he had never told us, and it<br>was the second time in my 33 years that I have heard my grandpa cry.</p></blockquote><p>The other is Andrew’s [reaction ][2]to Barack’s speech he gave last night (you), this morning (me): </p><blockquote><p>If I needed reassurance that this man is the most formidable force<br>in American politics today, his speech tonight confirmed it. It was<br>shrewd – with an artful positioning on Iraq. It was graceful – with<br>respect for McCain’s service and Clinton’s tenacity. It was brutal – in<br>turning around McCain’s Iraq visit meme to domestic economic woes. It<br>was patriotic – in its evocation of Gettysburg and the Second World<br>War. It was outer-directed: not for Obama the recourse to<br>self-satisfied identity politics of the kind used by the Clintons<br>because they often have nothing else. It was moving. I thought I even<br>saw some suggestions of tears as he remembered his grandmother. It was<br>also rhetorically more powerful than McCain – not by a small amount but<br>by a mile. Put McCain’s speech against Obama’s – and this was a<br>wipe-out. Not a victory. A wipe-out. Rhetorically, they are simply not<br>in the same league. And if the contrast tonight between McCain and<br>Obama holds for the rest of the campaign, McCain is facing a defeat of<br>historic proportions.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One more thing: with McCain’s and Clinton’s speeches, you could not<br>forget the politics of it. With Obama, you forgot about that at times.<br>You actually lifted your eyes a little and believed a little and hoped<br>a little.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Yes, he can. And anyone who under-estimates that will regret it.</p></blockquote><p>I awoke at five this morning and timed it perfectly as he was about to take the stage when I got the TV sorted.  CNN had audio but no visual as the signal was scrambled.  Luckily for me BBC carried the entire thing, except for a vital moment during his wind up at the end where the signal died and I cursed to all hell the Somali desert winds that were impeding my political joy. </p><p>On a related note, the NY Times had this grand photo of the Obamas watching Hillary’s speech.  I think the frustration on Michelle’s face and the stoicism on Barack’s face are more telling than any words I can write.  As I thought more about it I became more and more irate at HRC’s intransigence and utter lack of class.  This night was all about her for her, and a third about her for Obama.  It is over.  She needs to face it and the DNC elites need to ensure that she faces it.  I am frustrated at the apparent spinelessness of the party supremos.  Why are they so scared of Bill’s wrath? </p><p>Although I couldn’t see her comment, I heard Donna Brazille (a superdelegate and CNN commentator) say something akin to, “well, I didn’t support him because he didn’t need me to put him over the top.”  That is utter crap.  You are a middle aged black woman.  Don’t tell me he doesn’t need your support!  The DNC could learn a lot from the discipline of the RNC.  I told Big_Head today when I called because of happiness that the DNC can be maddening with its uber-hippy notions of flaunting of discipline.  Sometimes that is fantastic, but this isn’t one of them.  And, by the way, if I hear one more time that HRC is doing this for her supporters I’m going to stab 48 pencils into the eye of the first person I see.</p><p>In any event, the man I came late to support is now the first candidate of color from a major American party.  Hooray!</p><p>Oh, the [photo][5]: </p><p>[]: <a href=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/03/bmchipsomodevillagetty.jpg>http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/06/03/bmchipsomodevillagetty.jpg</a>
