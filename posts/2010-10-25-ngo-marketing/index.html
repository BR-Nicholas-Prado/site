Last week was the Hargeisa Trade Fair. Our business wanted a booth to network and develop further relationships with clients. You know, the type of thing that happens at conventions all around the world every day.
But the Hargeisa Trade Fair was a bit different. First off, they didn’t have that many booths. Granted we were a bit late to the game, but it was still fairly annoying that we were unable to secure a booth."><meta name=keywords content="legaltech,resilience,development 2.0,development policy,ngos"><meta name=robots content="noodp"><meta name=theme-color content><link rel=canonical href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2010-10-25-ngo-marketing/><title>On NGO Marketing :: underWater desert Blogging — Casey Kuhlman's Site</title><link href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flag-icon-css/3.2.1/css/flag-icon.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=/main.min.84ed5579024525d4b50458514d1a43e40dd5272df45c7cd6da85b225af457154.css><meta itemprop=name content="On NGO Marketing"><meta itemprop=description content="![Meeting via jcolman @ flickr]({{ site.url }}{{ site.root }}{{ site.images_dir }}/{{ page.date | date: &ldquo;%Y&rdquo; }}/2325118043_ed2da74cc0.jpg)
