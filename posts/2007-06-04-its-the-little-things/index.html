collects coins from evil empires.  he has been wanting me to bring him coins from SL when i go to the netherlands this week.  i told him, no problem.  then i one up-ed him by bringing him coins from an even more evil empire: liberia. </p><p>urs and i made a weekend trip to liberia.  other highlights which you will have to ask me about over a drink: missing the helicopter and taking a speed boat at mach two in 5 foot seas at oblique angles to the trajectory of the boat in order for 25 minutes in order to make our plane.  almost being forced into an impromptu inspection of a liberian immigration detention facility. food and beverage smuggling. <a href="http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=68&art_id=nw20070604113522453C836170">avoiding taking</a> the helicopter which crashed and killed 22 other people.</p><p>but that is not all i have to say about that.  there were a lot of differences for only a forty minute flight.  one definite difference is that the people there are colder.  i told urs that i felt like the smiles didn’t come as easy as they do to SLeans but when they came they were bigger.  they are a bigger people, overall, that the SLeans for sure.  and maybe due to the proximity of the war, but they feel overall more militant. </p><p>it was weird there the dynamics between the whites and the blacks that i observed.  overall it seemed that the whites were almost subservient to the blacks.  it wasn’t exactly a power dynamic realignment, it was more like business humans schmoozing with government and in this case it was amplified b/c the business people were white and the ministers, etc. were black.  but it was odd to see, and good to see that almost everywhere we went blacks were a majority.  you may think, well, duh, you’re in africa.  but in SL it is not like that.  most every place where the expats go they go in droves and there will be very few black people there.  it is hideous and annoys me to no end, and i try to avoid it but sometimes the avoiding is harder than the capitulating.  i have rarely seen a SL minister or high-ranking official, even in the nice places.  and in only a few minutes in the mamba point hotel in monrovia i saw two ministers and two senators and a few congressmen.  so had i stayed longer and not left for drinks at the marine house on the us embassy compound where a friend of mine had been ten years before during some massive unrest, i’m sure i would have seen more.  we saw charles taylor’s wife at the grocery store.  i have never seen anyone of import in SL.  never.</p><p>but the white people there seemed odd to me.  more hardened than here. less save the world types and more…different.  i was trying for some time to put my finger on what it was and i still cannot.  i think that the white people there also have a hard life and many of them do not have the freedom that we have here in SL to mingle.  also you saw a lot more old people there. not the white people so much but dignified african gentlemen and ladies.  it was good to see how elegant they looked, but it was also good to see that either they have eradicated a lot of diseases or their healthcare system is marginally better.</p><p>the city itself is slightly more developed in my opinion than freetown.  the power is about the same, but the water situation is better (it is easier b/c of the lack of hills) and the transportation infrastructure is miles ahead.  construction infrastructure and construction itself is vastly more improved than here in freetown where they are still constructing with manpower and wheelbarrows, there they had he3avy machinery and a certain taste in architecture which you will not find elsewhere.  also the port is a freeport and is operational, there is an industrial sector which is about ready to come back online and the sanctions on their diamonds have just been lifted and on other products it is about to be lifted.  so they are well-established to make leaps and bounds of improvements if they continue their current trend.   </p><p>the last tanglible difference was how much more urban it felt.  there was one beach bar in monrovia, but only one.  here there are many.  freetown in comparison is more like a laid-back beach community and monrovia was more like a city that is going places and has things to do.  the streets were wide but moveable.  the clubs were not open air but where inside and the music was less african and more american/european.  monrovia had more sectors or more planned urban design than freetown. </p><p>so that is my review of the difference there were others that we realized, but those are the main ones worthy of note.  now i must work.</p><p>i leave on thursday night to go to amsterdam and then down to the hague.  i should arrive in the hague friday afternoon.  i’ll be there through the summer.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24"
