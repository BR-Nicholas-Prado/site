(as eric dsaid when he was drunk the other night. i’m not sure what he meant)</p><p>in the real world still waiting on the word on the next manuscript.  my editor likes it and they have circled it around SMP.  they were going to bring it up in production meeting to talk about whether they want it or not.  i am pretty confident, especially based upon our publicists comment to the assistant publisher (Senior VP), &ldquo;I don’t care if it sucks, I can sell the fucking thing.&rdquo;  So maybe i’ll know today, maybe i’ll know tomorrow, maybe i’ll know next week, maybe i’ll know in september.  Who knows.</p><p>Am back east, in NC (winston-salem) visiting best ole friend.  have put 2200 miles on my car over the last week, have visited one cousin, one brother, one college friend, one college, one elementary friend, one law school, and now one best friend.  if no word comes tomorrow on the deal i will be signing a nashville lease on monday and then will spend the rest of the week moving in.</p><p>this shit is getting tight.  and i don’t mean TI-EGHT.  i mean flippin’ close</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>576 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2005-08-05 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-08-06-all-moved-in/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
