were two themes that I wanted to clean-up from the Senegal trip.  The first is this little artist community that exists on Isle de Goree a thirty minute ferry ride from Dakaar.  The second will come

de Goree has, at various times, been a defensive position protecting the bay where the port of Dakaar is and/or a slave exporting island.  Most times the slave traders would take slaves to islands off the coast of West Africa and then barter with the transportation people there on the island.  This was safer than doing it on the mainland as the slaves couldn’t escape back into the jungle.  Also the traders didn’t know exactly when a new ship would be coming to pick up a new load of people to take away to historical and continued oppression and exploitation. </p><p>[![Imgp1750_2][3]][3] So all along the coast of West Africa there are these islands.  Isle de Goree markets itself as one of these, but in truth the garrison on the island is small enough that it could only have held a small number of people, therefore the modern historical perspective on the island is that it was a slave trading post, but always a minor one. </p><p>[]: <a href=http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1750_2.jpg>http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/imgp1750_2.jpg</a></p><p>Then you get to the other historical role for the island.  On the island there was a colonial era fortress, WWI cannons and WWII shore guns, all coexisting in various spots on the island.  The colonial one faced the shore, likely because their range was short and they’d want to get the ships as they were approaching the port before wasting their ammunition.  The WW guns with their further ranges were facing out to see. </p><p>[![4382455][4]][4] Currently the island is a tourist trap for people wanting to reconcile the history of slavery.  But many of those people, myopic in their pilgrimage miss much of the modern beauty of the island.  Now it is full of art, which is mostly located one end of the island.  There is this one hill on the seaward side of the island that has this huge hill, it is where the WW guns are facing out to sea. </p><p>[]: <a href=http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/4382455.jpg>http://caseykuhlman.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/29/4382455.jpg</a></p><p>When you come to the bottom of the hill you see all kinds of painted wall art.  Beautiful primary colors in traditional senegalese motifs.  It was, by far, the best art I’ve seen in Africa.  As you wind your way up the switchbacks on the side of the hill you transition slowly such that at the tip, intertwined with the bunkers of war and the desolate, abandoned guns is the junk art. </p><p>[![Imgp1743][5]][5] Along the way you meet may rastafarians and other truly hip people that live on this island.  Most of the guys who make the junk art at the top of the hill live in the bunkers under the guns and they all have one teacher: the professor.  The professor sold me a piece of work that is going to go to Brian. </p><p>[]: <a

is the most truly beat place I’ve ever been, Isle de Goree.  I have often wondered if Kerouac and Cassady and the rest were alive today where would they be?  Would modern transportation possibilities have altered their fascination with America and their intention to dominate it by seeing all of it?  I’m not sure. </p><p>[![Imgp1754][6]][6]I think that at a minimum it would have tightened their cycles such that everything would happen faster, they would have gotten bored faster since they would have been able to see many things quic ker.  So I think that many of them may have focussed outside the US.  But maybe not.  Nevertheless, if they did, I think many of them would have dug the beat characters that I found on the Isle. </p><p>[]: <a

if I could just find a willing art dealer in the states I could start my own import business of Senegalese art.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg
