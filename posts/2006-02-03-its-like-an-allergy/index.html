when they are called on in class and for some reason the IT people haven’t blocked the internet that particular class (of course this only happens when i remember to bring my wireless PCMCIA card, b/c i’m not advanced tech-boy and do not have this snazzy internal wireless thing….no wires….fucking genius.)</p><p>what i cannot really well is to transfer across these platforms.  for some reason i feel like communications which happened in one forum should stay in that forum only.  i have always known this, but it was driven home to me today when someone came up to me and said, &ldquo;i just added you as a friend on facebook.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;i know.&rdquo;  i said with my crunched eyebrows face.  i’m not sure if i was confused as to whether he genuinely thought he was informing me.  was i confused b/c i’m not really his friend and we never talk and suddenly his clicking on my profile and the &ldquo;add friend&rdquo; button is the lubrication to get the ole’ engine of friendship and get to know ya started up again.  was i confused b/c i just don’t like to communicate out of context.  i’m not sure why i gave him that look, but i certainly did.</p><p>oh well, it started a nice little chat with my new friend.  i know he is my friend to because i have a fucking web page with my name in bold and big font and he is listed under my friends.  maybe it is all growing on me.  maybe i just like to know who my friends are.  where do i title my BFF?</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>533 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2006-02-03 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2006-02-10-summer/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
