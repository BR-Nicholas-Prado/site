These countries are wary that the possible high<br>costs of climate change mitigation will jeopardize their development goals. The<br>result of that opposition is the CDM—a system that compensates developing<br>countries for the full extra cost of any policies to control emissions. The CDM<br>was a good idea in principle, but in practice it is not working well. The scheme<br>has become mired in red tape as countries and investors try to establish their<br>baseline levels of emissions and the reduction in emissions from each project.<br>(The difference between the baseline and the reduced level is the key to the CDM<br>concept—that difference becomes a credit that can be used to offset emission<br>obligations elsewhere in the world, such as in Europe’s emission trading<br>system). The problems have encouraged gaming and they have caused CDM investors<br>to focus on activities that are easy to quantify and which are marginal in<br>nature. Indeed, energy projects account for just 17% of the CDM pipeline. Almost<br>none of the energy projects are of the type that will lead to fundamental<br>changes in countries’ energy systems.<a href=#_ftn5>[5]</a></p><p>If the India nuclear deal is successful, it will frame a new approach to<br>engaging developing countries in a climate strategy. This approach would focus<br>on finding game-changing policies that align with reluctant countries’<br>interests.<a href=#_ftn6>[6]</a> Rather than involving hundreds of<br>small and marginal projects, this style of engagement would focus on just a<br>handful of large pivotal actions involving just a few critical countries. This<br>concept is incidentally at the core of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean<br>Development and Climate, whose six members, including India and the U.S.,<br>account for half the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. That Partnership has<br>promise, but it remains young. Success with this nuclear deal could offer a<br>credible example of practical actions that the Partnership could encourage.</p></blockquote><p>I admit to not having researched the &ldquo;Partnership&rdquo; that he cites at the end of the passage.  I know this much, if we keep basing our energy requirements upon coal we are not really going to get anywhere.  keeping coal production stationary without anything more is only going to hurt, even if we keep up with rising energy demands by substituting that additional delta with nuclear (therefore non-carbon emitting) energy.  this is for two reasons, one: the coal is going to likely get dirtier.  this has been happening over the past three decades as coal producers have seen a decrease in the BTU’s per ton of coal b/c it is not as &ldquo;good&rdquo; of coal.  most of the established mines are beginning to get the dregs and new exploration and development costs capital.  if i was in the energy industry (which is oxymoronic) i would sink all my capital investment money that i could spare into something else since the political and regulatory regime is inevitably going to get rockier in the next five to ten years.  there is too much risk there.  this flows into the second reason why we need to reduce and not to contain the amount of coal we use in energy production.  people (and the more likely players in my model, at least in america: the insurance companies, once the legal system actually holds them accountable for paying for the hurricanes and stops them from evading those payouts) are going to get sick of it.  they are going to eventually hold some political system accountable when the links are clearly established and the green left finally puts it all together into a cohesive package (rove style).</p><p>ok that is all for now.  this is deeply integrated in my mind: enviroments, trade, geopolitics, policies, economics, societies and cultural sytems.  i hope to keep blogging more on these themes and less on other banalities.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>984 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2006-07-21 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2006-07-21-there-isnt-much-you-can-do-except-realize/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
