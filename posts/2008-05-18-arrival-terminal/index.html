I<br>guess I’m settled in here now.  I am living in a hotel suite for the time<br>being.  In maybe six weeks or so I’ll move either into a villa on the<br>grounds of this hotel or have been talking to a few people here about the<br>possibility of getting a compound like we had when I was in Salone.  Either<br>way, the living is pretty decent. </p><p>My suite has a TV with<br>satellite connection (CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera English and some Dubai channels that<br>show movies in English and a sports channel that has soccer on a lot), sitting<br>room  with fridge, a bedroom with a big bed (hard as a rock) and a desk<br>for me to do some work on. <br>The hotel is a fairly big<br>compound and I think I’m able to put human smuggling as a room charge, since I<br>seem to be able to charge everything else on my room!  There is a restaurant<br>and a little convenience store where I can get a few supplies.  All<br>chargeable to my room.  There is wireless internet, although it seems to<br>come and go.  The water runs and the<br>electricity seems fairly constant without a loud generator.  So I’m in the<br>lap of luxury! </p><p>Sort of.   </p><p>The town is very poor.  I<br>told Highlands that it is like Freetown without the natural beauty.  It<br>is sort of in a bowl, surrounded by smallish hills on all sides.  My hotel<br>sits on one of them and I have a great view of the town.  The surroundings<br>are very much like when I was in 29 Palms, desert.  Although here it has<br>rained most days and is a bit cooler than in 29 Palms, and here it is a bit<br>flatter than it was in Cali.  The infrastructure in the town is somewhat<br>better than Freetown, at least here most have running water and<br>electricity.  Some people even have cable TV.  The roads are worse, most are dirt and the few that are<br>paved are riddled with pot holes.  Luckily we have a Land Cruiser with<br>good suspension and a driver who has a lead foot (for once that wasn’t sarcasm,<br>I actually like him to drive faster on the roads b/c we miss many of the<br>bumps). </p><p>There is very little to do,<br>unfortunately.  We went to an NGO/UN party last night, but left at 1130<br>and were harassed at five checkpoints on the way back.  The police<br>couldn’t fathom that we would want to be out that late!  So, there may be<br>some cultural growing to do.  Maybe I’ll do it at the local theater that I<br>drove by today on my way to the market!  Guess I’m going to get my fill of<br>reading, writing and working until Highlands gets here, and likely<br>afterwards. </p><p>The people seem very<br>relaxed.  They actually seem to like that I’m American.  It is an odd<br>feeling.  They are much less aggressive and much more reserved than the<br>West Africans (from what I’ve seen).  Today I went to the market to get<br>some coffee and some veggies and was only asked for money once (by an old lady<br>who had polio).  In Freetown I would have been asked at least 10,000 times<br>for money.  They are also less gregarious and a bit harder to joke<br>with.  We’ll see, I need to figure out what makes them tick before I am<br>able to really develop a rapport with them.</p><p>My partner is nice.  From<br>what I can tell he and I are getting along.  At the party last night I<br>started to meet some in the local NGO/UN community.  It is extraordinarily<br>small, all things considered.  But they all seemed like the others<br>I met in West Africa.  I guess it takes a weirdo mind to get into this<br>work and stay in it.  At least at the party there was a bit of beer.<br>It is a dry country!!!!! </p><p>All in all, there is the good<br>and the bad, but I’m OK.  Once I get my feet under me I’ll be able to<br>really assess whether I like it here, whether I like this work, etc.  But<br>for now I’m happy and healthy, which is all I can ask for.</p><p>In case you were looking for pictures, I cannot<br>provide them!  My camera has either been appropriated by some customs<br>official along the way or was left behind for some insane reason.  Luckily<br>I had recently cleaned off the card!  Not to fret, my graduation splurge<br>for myself is going to be a nice DSLR that I will try to have someone get for<br>me and ship over in a month or two.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24"
