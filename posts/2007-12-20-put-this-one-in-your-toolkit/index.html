I remember one time when Evergreen and I were in the Marine Corps. He was so tired and it was so dark outside that he heated up a bag of peanut butter to put in his cheese ravioli bag of treats. It was so disgusting that he had to go hungry or eat it, considering the circumstances (we were on one meal a day for the exercise and all exhausted and constantly hungry) he ate it, but I will always remember the look on his face when he turned to me and said in his Texas draw, &amp;ldquo;Casey, put this one in your toolkit, always check if the bag is peanut butter or cheese cause if you get this one wrong it’ll costya."><meta name=keywords content="legaltech,resilience"><meta name=robots content="noodp"><meta name=theme-color content><link rel=canonical href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-12-20-put-this-one-in-your-toolkit/><title>Put this one in your toolkit :: underWater desert Blogging — Casey Kuhlman's Site</title><link href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flag-icon-css/3.2.1/css/flag-icon.min.css rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=/main.min.84ed5579024525d4b50458514d1a43e40dd5272df45c7cd6da85b225af457154.css><meta itemprop=name content="Put this one in your toolkit"><meta itemprop=description content="[![Captainmorgan2][2]][2]
