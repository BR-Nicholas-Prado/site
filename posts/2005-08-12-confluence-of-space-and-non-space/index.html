some people.  virtually, that means over the internet for the older listeners among you, &ldquo;meet&rdquo;-ed some people.  threw out a few funny emails, a bit of IM-ing banter, some networking (apparently friendster is D_E_A_D dead, in case you cared, the new friendster is facebook) sites where you put up your shit and they can all track you down….or something.  so my shite is out there and we’ll see how much of a rock star i can become.  needless to say, i’m getting it on virtual style. </p><p>whatever happened to anticipation?  to getting to know people after you meet them on the big &ldquo;first day of school&rdquo; and then wondering which group you have the chance to fit in?  and if it is a conglomeration then maybe you should start your own group?  very uncomfortable….very exciting.  i guess i’ll only taste that.  but for now i’m happy being an internet rock star</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>540 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2005-08-12 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-08-14-incoherency/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
