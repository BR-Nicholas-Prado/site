clothes probably more suited to a skier than a rider.  but that didn’t seem to phase people.</p><p>the next winter i came here (where i am now).  i came to aspen.  it was a good transition, it was what i needed.  as i’ve written at length and told most people i know, this is my heaven, my paradise.  but here people my age do not ride.  they ski.  in fact the only people that ride here are the 15 to 20 crowd.  even the snowboard instructors are all younger than me, and the ones that are my age all tell me that on their days off they prefer to ski.</p><p>but me, obstinate as always, continued last season to ride.  i don’t really regret it.  i did improve to the point where nothing really scares me and i can pretty much get through anything on an area mountain.  backcountry stuff maybe maybe not.  but for the most part i can hold my own. today, however, i was thinking about all of this.  why don’t i ski?  there really is no reason that i can think of.</p><p>it is so much more elegant.  and not that i’m elegant in the slightest, i am the founding member of the alley cat climbing club, but i just seems more me to me.  you don’t have to fuck with strapping yourself in.  you don’t have to bother when you get to bump sections to change your style.  you can get away with wearing what i wear without being an oddity.  nonetheless i have kept riding.</p><p>sometimes i wonder if my window has passed.  now i’m a vacationer, i am one of those who i looked down upon while i lived in paradise.  i do not have an entire 100 days of skiing to perfect a new sport, so i am forced to make choices, to compromise.  so tomorrow i ski for the second day.  we’ll see how it goes.  i do like to ride, but i think that i’m bored with it a bit and looking for something new.  riding is fun on powder days, but other than that i think i have it. </p><p>onward as always.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>568 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2006-01-03 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2006-01-13-in-the-time-of-snow-patrols-i-was-a-monkey/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
