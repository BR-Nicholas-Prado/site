Rumsfeld decision is the executive issuing an executive order that CIA interrogation techniques, if conducted for the purpose of eliciting intelligence are per sae legal.  there are a few nuances in the order, first the techniques must not violate the McCain Ammendment against torture or dismemberment (but according to most human rights decisions this leaves a wide berth).  secondly, the techniques must not be conducted with the purpose of degrading the human.  well, shit, that just about guts the protections that the Hamdan decision offered to detainees at Guantanamo (and hopefully by extrapolation to other detention facilities, although there is no jurisprudence on point with regards to that issue — yet). </p><p>two men with conservative pedigrees which few could attack have written an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/25/AR2007072501881.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns">OpEd in the Washington Post calling out the Administration</a> for this lack of deference and showing how wrong the decision is based upon common international legal interpretation principles. </p><p>i understand that we need to keep the country safe.  i have no quibble with national security scholars who dicker over specifics, but this is a bridge too far for me.  by simply saying that the purpose of the interrogation is paramount in any determination we are gutting the protections found in Common Article 3.  full stop.  the CIA will always be able to argue that it is interrogating for the purpose of eliciting intelligence, in fact it is all it does and even in the most degrading of treatments all they have to do is to ask a question (no matter how obvious or mundane) and then claim that the purpose was to gather intelligence.  once they get through the wicket then they are enable to do whatever they want per the text of the executive order. </p><p>it seems that the administration is digging a hole to bury itself in needlessly.  there are other ways to protect yourself without stooping to tit for tat reciprocity. </p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>592 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2007-07-26 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-07-26-africas-past-present-and-future/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
