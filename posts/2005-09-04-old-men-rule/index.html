I<br>think that it is mostly to my &ldquo;advantage,&rdquo; although there are a few<br>&ldquo;disadvantages.&rdquo;</p><p>My view of much of my class is fairly close to what I expected:  greek,<br>business or poli sci majors, straight from college, clicky, etc.  In<br>the two weeks we’ve been together now I have watched the stratification<br>of this formerly nebulous mixture o people into their respective<br>pieces, or more appropriately how they have viewed themselves<br>throughout their undergraduate experience.  This is a carryover for<br>these people, a mere continuation.  I can tell it by the way they talk<br>about drinking by the away messages they leave on their AIM accounts by<br>the ease which they flow around the building with their computer bags<br>yanking at their trapezious muscles. </p><p>There are a few exceptions to the rules, those that are not greek,<br>those with interesting majore, those that took the vaunted one year<br>off, but by and large these exceptions are only in one category and<br>those that exhibit these exceptions fall into line on the other<br>categories. </p><p>There are a few others.  I know of two with masters (one that has his<br>MFA in creative writing and with whom I have had many chats), and one<br>other guy who is older than me.  He is married with a couple of kids,<br>etc. </p><p>Then there is me.  I’m not yet sure how I fit into the social spectrum,<br>cream or juice?  I, frankly, do not care.  I’m equally nice and equally<br>ass-holic to most people which stems from the fact that I feel that I<br>have much less vested in the social aspect of this school scenario.<br>I’ve been in the real world, I know what it is like to spend entire<br>months only talking to one or two people, none of that ever bothered<br>me.  But many of these people do not know that freedom and so they tie<br>much of their identity up in the social dynamics.</p><p>This vestiture creates some interesting things.  Firstly, I think it<br>creates in many a fear of &ldquo;being called on&rdquo; by the professors.  In the<br>socratic method professors will pick out a student and then stick with<br>them for a while asking question after question, hopefully breaking off<br>the outside skin of the onion and distilling the truth out of the<br>specificity of the case…..specificity to generality is the law school<br>mantra (mixing of metaphors was on purpose).  But this method is<br>generally frightening to many people b/c their brainpower will be laid<br>out there for all their social comrades to see if they’re an idiot or<br>surprisingly mentally adroit.  Secondly, I think it creates a dynamic<br>similar to high school.  We are around the same people, in the same<br>building, all the time.  What I mean by the high school simile (which<br>is far from unique) is merely the constancy of display.  You can’t blow<br>up at someone without the rest of the class finding out about it<br>quickly and then they will all look at you, look at you in class, look<br>at you in the halls on the way to the lockers, look at you in the cafe<br>during lunch, look at you in the library after class when much of our<br>compatriots are in the same large room with big tables that always<br>makes me think that I’m in the study hall from Dead Poet’s Society and<br>that cranky teacher is going to come in at any moment and make me turn<br>off my iPod and study harder.</p><p>So the rest of them are very vested.  I’m not.  I don’t give a flying<br>rat fuck about any of that stuff.  I’m here to spend $60k a year to<br>learn stuff, and I’ll learn it well.</p><p>The life experience aspect of it all is the other advantage that I<br>hold, the only one that really matters (I think) besides the &ldquo;not<br>caring about what people think of me&rdquo; advantage.  In classes where you<br>are nearly required to have a perspective on the world and you can only<br>conceptually create one it builds an idealist when a realist would do.<br>These are all advantages and I won’t belabor the point, even though it<br>is a valid one.  I understand business in a way they don’t.  I<br>understand politics in a way they don’t.  I understand foreign<br>relations, and constitutional powers and the mind of evil people in a<br>way they don’t.  But none of that matters now.  Right now we’ve all<br>been thrown blindfolded, tied up, and dowsed in K-Y into the pool and<br>are merely trying to get our bearings without the lube making our eyes<br>sting.  We’ll just have to see how this all pans out.</p><p>The main disadvantage is the being used to the school deal and the<br>knowing how to study deals…..</p></blockquote><p>Happy Birthday to me.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>960 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2005-09-04 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-09-12-footballs-back/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
