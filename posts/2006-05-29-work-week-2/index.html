Aspen</p><p>where everyone is<br>overly educated and therefore has an opinion and the smallest things get bogged<br>down due to the overload of opinions as to how “this should get done.” </p><p>Here there had<br>been a major political battle fought and the interest group lost. What happened was the city was looking to<br>lock in these developments within their jurisdiction since they would then<br>receive the tax revenue. So the city and<br>the developers signed a contract wherein the developers would promise to build<br>and the city would promise the developers environmental regulations that remain<br>constant for fifteen years. The interest<br>group at that point raised their BS flag and said hold on a minute here, if we<br>lobby the city council and win stricter environmental regulations (the<br>subdivisions are both in environmentally sensitive areas that recharge one of<br>the main aquifers around central Texas) at some point in the future (which they<br>have and they have) then we’re not getting the benefit of our bargain since the<br>development contract forecloses our right to democratic process. Since the interest group was getting no where<br>with the city council they moved on to the state legislature, when they lost<br>there and the state passed a bill saying that cities could do this, then they<br>filed suit. So this case has a lot of<br>vindictive overtones to it. </p><p>The other thing<br>that could possibly be going on is that this could be watch-out<br>litigation. I think this is the more<br>probable scenario. Probably the interest<br>group is taking a hard line stance here in order to make development more<br>costly. If a developer was looking to<br>develop in this part of
Central Texas</p><p>(which<br>apparently is booming) then the interest group has an interest in them not<br>developing in the environmentally sensitive areas. At a minimum the interest group’s litigation<br>would send a message to developers that developing in sensitive areas will be<br>more costly upfront than normal development, this cost-added should dampen some<br>of the development. Although certainly<br>raising the costs some would not preclude destructive development (which I<br>suspect is the interest group’s end goal). With regard to the city at least, the group may lose this battle, but it<br>seems they have won the war. The city<br>passed ordinances that are applicable to both its city limits and to its huge<br>extra-territorial jurisdiction in 2005 that truly do protect the environment in<br>the way that the interest group wanted to. I cannot claim to know that it was because of this litigation that the<br>city changed, but I suspect that to a certain extent it did. If nothing else the litigation raised public<br>awareness about what the development in environmentally sensitive areas was<br>doing to the water supply in this part of the state. </p><p>The point of this<br>is that one of the things that I suspected all along and that is not (and<br>cannot) be taught to first year law students is that litigation is merely one<br>tool. Entities have goals, well they should<br>have goals at least, and they have various tools at their disposal that enable<br>them to reach their goals: contracts, political process, litigation and other<br>agreements or dispute resolution systems. The pedagogy of law schools puts such an emphasis on the cases that do<br>make it pretty far down the litigation road that I think sometimes there is a<br>danger for law students to lose track of how few those cases are and to what<br>the other ways to achieve ones goals may be. In this case that I’m working on I really don’t think that they care as<br>much about this litigation as their two feet high record may attest, I think<br>they are looking beyond this one development to how they can truly restrict<br>future harmful development. They have<br>used this litigation to either raise public awareness or to raise costs to<br>developers or to raise the political stakes for the city enough that in the end<br>they got what they wanted, no matter what the outcome of this case may be. **</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>1194 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2006-05-29 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2006-06-02-back-2/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
