Over the course of the last 16 months, I have been privileged<br>and touched to witness the incredible dedication and sacrifice of so<br>many people working for our campaign. Every minute you put into helping<br>us win, every dollar you gave to keep up the fight meant more to me<br>than I can ever possibly tell you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>On Saturday, I will extend my congratulations to Senator Obama and<br>my support for his candidacy. This has been a long and hard-fought<br>campaign, but as I have always said, my differences with Senator Obama<br>are small compared to the differences we have with Senator McCain and<br>the Republicans.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I have said throughout the campaign that I would strongly support<br>Senator Obama if he were the Democratic Party's nominee, and I intend<br>to deliver on that promise.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>When I decided to run for president, I knew exactly why I was<br>getting into this race: to work hard every day for the millions of<br>Americans who need a voice in the White House.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I made you — and everyone who supported me — a promise: to stand<br>up for our shared values and to never back down. I'm going to keep that<br>promise today, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I will be speaking on Saturday about how together we can rally the<br>party behind Senator Obama. The stakes are too high and the task before<br>us too important to do otherwise.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I know as I continue my lifelong work for a stronger America and a<br>better world, I will turn to you for the support, the strength, and the<br>commitment that you have shown me in the past 16 months. And I will<br>always keep faith with the issues and causes that are important to you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In the past few days, you have shown that support once again with<br>hundreds of thousands of messages to the campaign, and again, I am<br>touched by your thoughtfulness and kindness.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I can never possibly express my gratitude, so let me say simply, thank you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sincerely,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Hillary Rodham Clinton</p></blockquote><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>640 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2008-06-05 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2008-06-06-best-political-team-gets-giddy/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
