some of my current thought patterns.  those that know me [everyone that reads this blog] knows of my mobile ways in geography but in many aspects of my life. </p><p>my brother has been applying to grad schools and he and i have been bantering regarding his personal statement.  he recently told me that he has lost his mojo and he doesn’t seem to have any motivation to really put his heart into the document.  i replied:</p><p>shouldn’t fear of becoming what your stereotypes<br>dictate you should become enough?  has always been for me.  do you<br>want THIS to continue?</p><p>to which he replied: </p><p>I don’t really get your drift…<br>Do I want WHAT to continue?</p><p>to which i replied:  EXACTLY</p><p>but then i wrote the following.</p><blockquote><p>was thinking the last few days about what my gist really was in that<br>last email.  i guess that the gist of it was fairly simply readable, but<br>there are a lot of consequences that have opened up in my mind regarding<br>such a premise.</p><p>my argument that change is predicated upon some dissatisfaction with the<br>currency of something is relatively banal and easy to understand. <br>personal lives, like nature, tend to embrace some semblance of an<br>inertial existence.  when there is change there is massive change when<br>there is stagnation there is massive stagnation.  you do not have to<br>look further than [insert reality tv show here] to figure that one out. <br>but life, like nature require some sort of energy to take you between<br>inertial energy states  [action to rest or vice the versa].  thus we<br>enter the proof of my original theorem whereas dissatisfaction is the<br>catalyst for change.  not always would it be the only catalyst [just as<br>there is potential energy and kinetic energy] but generally i would<br>argue it is the most prevalent catalyst.</p><p>well that is all fine and good and was the beginning and end of my posit<br>to you.  if you want to change [read: improve] then you have to focus<br>your dissatisfaction on the current state of your life which you want to<br>change [improve].  i find that if i do not focus this negative<br>motivation upon something tangible [or at least graspable] then i will<br>coherently know that i have to change something [presently i know that i<br>have to quit smoking] but i won’t do anything about it [as i'm not<br>focusing upon the fact that i'll die a horribly painful death as<br>carcinogens violently devour my insides].</p><p>but the real crux of this emails length comes when i take the next<br>step.  what happens when i say OK, change is created my dissatisfaction<br>[or pick your own synonym], i can buy that.  so why am i always<br>changing?  changing jobs, desires, locales, images, personalities,<br>auras, partners, i’m always changing something.  is it that i’m<br>dissatisfied with stagnation so my hatred of the stagnant creates a need<br>for perpetual motion [continuing the metaphor] and thus i feel that i<br>always  have to change something.</p><p>or is it deeper?  do i have an insatiable appetite to devour everything<br>i can?  am i not a locus descending upon the egyptians but THE locus<br>descending upon the egyptians?  once i finish with one project i have to<br>move on to the next.  whether that is establishing that i really am<br>smart as i think i am [cum laude from the #1 civil engineering program<br>in the world with full knowledge i could have done even better] and then<br>moving on to the next project of establishing my manliness [off to war<br>leading 228 Marines and responsible for their lives and safety;<br>unabashedly running into the teeth of enemy fire b/c that is what men<br>do] and then moving on to the project of establishing my koolness<br>[ski-bumming].  on and on in this and other facets of my life besides<br>the professional.</p><p>fine i do that but why?  is it that i find something i want, i achieve<br>it and find that it isn’t really what i want?  or are these merely steps<br>along a process to becoming something larger than is definable with a<br>few words or mere labels?  this is my personal, present, hypothesis.  i<br>think that i dislike labels so much that i’m willing to change and put<br>my body and mind through the stress of constant change merely so i<br>cannot be labeled as this or that.</p><p>is that legitimate?  is that stupid?  i don’t know but i think that that<br>is nevertheless me.  i think that i view life as an iterative process as<br>opposed to a destination with the white picket fence blah blah.  but<br>there is a grave danger i think with the way that i’ve come to look at<br>the world.  i guess the danger as i see it is ending up alone b/c i’m<br>either too picky or too mobile or too ADHD to stay with someone for very<br>long.  the danger is further with my lack of wanting to lay down any<br>roots [the fact that the bar is a massive exam and if i ever move to a<br>new state i have to retake it and thus i am impetized to stay in one<br>state scares the living shit out of me] will not let me have any real<br>true connections outside of my friends who are spread across the country<br>and who love me and will email and talk on the phone with me and all<br>that but i only get to experience very little of life with.  we can go<br>further down this road of my fears but the point is this, will these<br>fears/dissatisfactions be enough to make me change my changing ways?</p></blockquote><p>~ # ~</p><p> </p></div></article><hr><div
