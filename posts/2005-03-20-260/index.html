(paul westerburg), old couples and cam his sister and best friend in the crowd.  his comment on the crowd was they were the only three people among the ten’s that were crowding the small space that were under thirty-five and not forced to be there by some outside force.</p><p>then the guy took the stage, burnt as cheech in 1978 after a hard day’s filming.  he told half of his stories before interrupting himself with some fiddling that would meander (always a medley becuase he could not decide on one song) for a few bars before asking a rhetoric or non-rhetoric question to the audience.  from time to time he would stop dead in his tracks and examine the drop ceiling tiles, i wonder if he was counting the holes in them or merely wondering in his stoned mind how they got up there.  at one point he stopped dead during an irish influence song based on a famous song everyone should know, but only loosely so you may not recognize it as this famous song and since he had titled the song texas you could just know it as texas from heretofore, and told the crowd that there was some &ldquo;really good listening going one right now…&rdquo; either that or he was just so out there that they were concentrating too hard to figure out his synopsial-crossings.</p><p>the unfortunate part, according to cam, was that his poetry was pretty good and his delivery, at least of the poetry, was quite good.  it seems unfortunate that it got drowned out by the cacophony of the other madnesses. </p><p>it appears that i will not be joining jack on the national book and appearances tour.  i’m more than a little pissed and upset about the situation.  what i don’t want to happen is for a wedge to be driven between him and i.  i’m not sure if that isn’t going to become an inevitability (maybe i need more negatives in there), hopefully it work itself out, who knows.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>503 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2005-03-20 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2005-03-24-259/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
