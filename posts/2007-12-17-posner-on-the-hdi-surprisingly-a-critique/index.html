Not that per<br>capita income, life expectancy at birth, and level of education as proxied by<br>adult literacy and school enrollments are unimportant; a ranking of each of<br>these aspects of human development might be a good first step in identifying<br>areas of weakness that a society might wish to devote additional resources to<br>improving. It is the combining of the indexes and announcing that the<br>combination offers a ranking of nations by the degree of their &ldquo;human&rdquo; as<br>distinct from narrowly defined &ldquo;economic&rdquo; development that strikes me as<br>dubious, and indeed as senseless. The obvious objection is to the equal<br>weighting of the three indexes, and to the omission of a host of other important<br>dimensions of development, such as housing quality, pollution, tax rates, adult<br>life expectancy, crime rates, unemployment, inflation, quality and variety of<br>goods and services, economic growth, and quality of education–though including<br>them would exacerbate the weighting problem, and some involve serious<br>measurement problems.</p></blockquote><p>First let me point out what this vaunted judge and law professor’s major problem with the HDI is: it is the combining of the indexes which troubles this self-proclaimed intellectual.  He goes on to say that he is also troubled about the lack of other factors which could be factored into the overall development index, but all while saying that he does not think that there is a difference between economic development and human development.</p><p>Many of my female friends absolutely detest this man for saying that there is an efficient amount of rape.  His point is fair enough, but does he have to say things in that manner.  I now know how they feel.  This piece absolutely enraged me for its complete lack of ignorance of the world.  It makes me ashamed to have attended law school.  It makes me ashamed to be an American.  Why do we continue to be so god damn ignorant of what lives outside our border? </p><p>It was hip, in development circles, to criticize the methodology of how the HDI was calculated….five years ago.  (And fair enough, it is also hip in law school to criticize Posner if you are even remotely left leaning.)  But never have I heard it criticized from a uniquely developed country perspective where the critique is essentially for developed countries vis a vis other developed countries the methodology is a failure.  He doesn’t even get into the methodology for how the soft indexes are calculated, and I’m glad because although I’m certain that this extremely smart man could comprehend what was happening that he would have something completely enraging to say.</p><p>OK, to something else.</p><p>~ # ~</p></div></article><hr><div class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>578 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2007-12-17 00:00 +0000</p></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=https://caseykuhlman.com/posts/2007-12-19-cultural-questionings/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
